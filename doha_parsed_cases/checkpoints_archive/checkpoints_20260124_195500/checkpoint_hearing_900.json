Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 7, 2017. On \nFebruary 15, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) implemented by the DOD \non June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on June 7, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on June 26, \n2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the file, and identified as Items 1 through \n\n \n2 \n \n6, was admitted without objection. Applicant responded to the FORM with additional \ninformation, which was marked as AX A-M, and admitted into the record without \nobjection.  I was assigned the case on August 13, 2019.  \n \n                                      Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about Cuba. The request and the attached source documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record. All of the documents referenced \nin the Request for Administrative Notice and the facts asserted therein, are from open \nsources and are dated. Cuba is an authoritarian state. Cuba has a one-party system in \nwhich the constitution recognizes the Communist Party as the only legal party and the \nhighest political entity of the state. \n \nU.S.-Cuba relations deteriorated in 2017, after the U.S. Department of State \nconfirmed that 26 U.S. diplomats suffered a series of unexplained injuries, including \nhearing loss and cognitive issues, with most occurring between November 2016 and \nAugust 2017. The Cuban government denied involvement or knowledge of the attacks, \nin response to which the U.S. Government withdrew 60% of its embassy staff, \nsuspended the issue of visas to Cubans, and required the Cuban Embassy in the \nUnited States to reduce its staff by two-thirds. \n \nIn January 2019, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) assessed that Cuba \nposes a persistent foreign intelligence threat to the United States, and that its \nintelligence services will continue to target the United States, which it sees as a primary \nthreat. The Castro regime was known to target the United States for intensive \nespionage activities. On April 24, 2019, the Department of State updated the Cuba \nRestricted List with five additional sub-entities owned by the Cuban military. \n \n Cuba\u2019s military, security, and intelligence services suppress the human rights of \nthe Cuban people. The Cuban government closely monitors activities, including \ncontacts with Cuban citizens who are suspected of engaging in activities that undermine \nstate security. The government of Cuba maintains tight control of information through \nownership of the communication networks and restricted internet access, meaning that \nthere is little privacy for organizations and individuals. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline B that (1.a) that Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen \nand resident of Cuba; and (1.b) that his sister is a citizen and resident of Cuba. \nApplicant admitted the allegations, and provided detailed explanations about his \nrelationship to them. (Items 1, 3) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n Applicant is a 31-year-old engineer, who was born in Cuba to Cuban parents. He \nlived in Cuba prior to the age of eight. (Item 4) In 1996, he entered the United States. \n(Item 3) His step-father and his mother won the Visa Lottery and after investigation were \nallowed to come to the United States. Applicant graduated from an American high \nschool in July 2006. Applicant obtained an associate\u2019s degree in 2012 and another \nassociate\u2019s degree in 2013. He is currently attending a university to complete his \nundergraduate degree. (AX A, Item 4) Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \n2007. (AX E) \n \n \n Applicant served in the United States Army Reserve from 2005 until 2009. He \nreceived a security clearance during his reserve time. (AX A) From 2009 to the present, \nApplicant has been a United States Air Force Reservist. He has received numerous \nawards and decorations. (AX C) In his current employment since July 2017, he \nmanages three classified networks and helps with agreements with Central America as \na Level II technician. (AX B) He was elected an Employee of the Year and has had \ngood performance evaluations. (AX B) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s biological father is a citizen and resident of Cuba. (SOR 1.a) \nHowever, Applicant does not know his address and states that his \u201crelationship with his \nfather is estranged and mostly non-existent.\u201d Applicant decided to terminate any \nrelationship with his father ten years ago. He elaborated in his answer to the SOR that it \nwas not an easy decision, but he needed to cut \u201cties\u201d due to his father abusing his \nmother. Applicant had no communication with his biological father from 2006 until he \nreceived a birthday email from him in August 2016. Applicant responded to the email \nand gave his father an update on his life. Applicant wrote that he worked for the \nDepartment of Defense. Applicant stated that he gave his father no details. He also did \nnot give his father his address and telephone number. Applicant has not corresponded \nwith him since that time. (Answer Item 3) Applicant sent his father three photos of \nhimself. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s half-sister, who is a citizen and resident of Cuba, also emailed him in \nAugust 2016 to wish him a happy birthday. (SOR 1.b) She stated that she was unhappy \nthat Applicant had never visited her in Cuba and was not happy that Applicant had not \ncorresponded with her all these years. Applicant did not respond. \n \n \nApplicant has not travelled to Cuba in approximately 15 years and does not \nprovide any financial support to his biological father or half-sister. He wants no further \ncontact with his father or half-sister. (Item 3) He visited Cuba when he was a junior in \nhigh school as a result of a parental arrangement. He stated that he never enjoyed a \nclose relationship to his biological father. Applicant considers his stepfather his Dad.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted eight letters as character references. His employer and \nsupervisors note that Applicant is an outstanding individual who is dedicated to each \nproject. There have never been any violations or disregard for his duties protecting \nsensitive information. Another supervisor states that Applicant has shown leadership, \nmaturity and team work in multiple areas. Some references have known Applicant for \nover nine years. His co-workers admire and respect him. His future-in-laws praise him \n\n \n4 \n \nfor his judgment and dedication to his family in the United States. They are both aware \nof the issues alleged in the SOR.  (AX D) \n \n \n \nApplicant is now engaged to be married to an American citizen. They live \ntogether in the United States. Applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather (who raised Applicant) \nlive in the United States, as well as Applicant\u2019s sister. Applicant has extended family \nwho live in the United States.   \n \n \nApplicant earns a good income, has a retirement account, several savings \naccounts and a net monthly remainder of almost $3,000. He has no financial interests in \nCuba. (AX G-K) He intends to buy a home when he marries. (AX F) \n \n \nApplicant responded to the FORM and provided additional information.  Applicant \nexpressed that while he was born in Cuba, the United States is his home and he would \nnever divide his allegiance to the United States. (Item 3) He emphasized that the United \nStates has provided him with the opportunity to develop a career in something that he \nloves and has allowed him to serve in the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force as a reservist. \nHe has worked for over ten years with the Department of Defense. (AX A, Item 4) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \n \nApplicant\u2019s biological father and half-sister are citizens and residents of Cuba. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts may create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both \ndirectly and through his family members. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the \nevidence.  \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \nand  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.1  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \n                                                          \n1 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Cuba. He moved to the United States when he was eight \nyears old, and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He was educated in the United States. His \nmother, stepfather, sister and extended family are in the United States. Applicant serves \nin the Reserves. He has a career that he loves and is engaged to be married to an \nAmerican citizen. Applicant has never had a close relationship with his biological father \nin Cuba. His biological father sent him an email in 2016 wishing him a happy birthday. \nApplicant, after ten years of silence decided to respond and sent his father a few \nphotos. Applicant did not give his address or phone number, but he stated that he works \nfor the Department of Defense. Applicant also received at the same time an email from \nhis half-sister. He did not respond. Three years have passed since those emails and \nthere has been no further communication.  \n \n \nApplicant decided over a decade ago not to have any communication with his \nbiological father. He does not want to see him or visit him in Cuba. He does not really \nknow his half-sister because Applicant came to the United States at the age of eight \nyears old.  His entire family is in the United States and he considers his stepfather his \nDad. Applicant would never risk his personal and professional life in the United States. \nHe is aware of Cuba and its authoritarian regime. Applicant\u2019s entire financial interests \nare in the United States. All of the above mitigating conditions apply.  \n  \n.   \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B and in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines. Applicant has provided significant information \nto meet his burden of proof. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u2013b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      ________________________ \n \n \n \n \n     Noreen A.

This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. On October 19, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.1 The SOR is similar to \n                                                          \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \n\n2 \n \na complaint in a civil court action.

Applicant speaks with his \nbrother about once a month.  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is also an 83-year-old widow who \nis a citizen and resident of India. (SOR 1.d) He speaks to her every two to three weeks \nby phone. She also visits the United States frequently. (Tr. 50) None of his relatives work \n                                                          \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). I \ndecided the case using new AGs effective June 8, 2017, as well as the former guidelines, and my \nconclusions would be the same under either guideline.  \n \n\n3 \n \nfor the Indian government or know the nature of Applicant\u2019s work. Applicant has given his \nparents about $15,000 in financial support over the years. They were gifts to his parents, \nas they are both retired professionals and have pensions. (SOR 1.e) \n \nIn about 2015, Applicant and his wife purchased an apartment in India, which is \ncurrently under construction, as a surprise gift for his parents. The approximate value is \n$105,000. The property is financed through a bank. The estimated balance of the \nmortgage is $70,000. (SOR 1.f) Applicant fully disclosed all possible financial interests in \nIndia on his security clearance and responses to questions. (GX 2). The construction is \nto be completed in 2019. (AX E) He is willing to sign the property over to his parents \nbefore end of construction if necessary. The value of the property constitutes a small \nfraction of his net worth.  \n \nApplicant and his wife co-own a bank account in India to facilitate wire transfers \nfrom his bank in the United States.  The account is used to pay for the apartment under \nconstruction for his parents. SOR 1.g) He presented documentation that the account is \nnow closed. (AX D) \n \nApplicant and his wife currently own a house in the United States that is worth \nabout $359,000. (Tr. 48) His current salary is about $155,000. His wife earns about \n$120,000. He approximates that the value of the apartment property in India is about 10 \nor 20 percent of his total net worth.  His investments are about $650,000 to $ 700,000. \nApplicant submitted documentation from his various savings accounts, pay stub, 401(k) \ninvestment accounts, checking account and a personal financial statement. (AX C with \n13 attachments). He and his wife want to settle in his current state as they want their two \nchildren to receive a fine education. He was emphatic that the United States is home now \nand forever. Both of their professional careers have flourished in the United States. (Tr. \n25) \n \nWhen questioned about a possible dilemma between protecting classified \ninformation versus loyalty to his family, Applicant recognizes his deep ties to his family, \nbut would not endanger national security. He would report any problem to his FSO. (Tr. \n38) \n \nApplicant presented two witnesses at the hearing. Each testified that Applicant is \na man of his word. They each have had professional dealings with Applicant and \nrecommend him for a security clearance. (Tr. 59-62) They are aware of the SOR \nallegations. They work closely with Applicant and both hold security clearances and \nrecognize the Applicant has been extremely conscientious about classified or sensitive \ninformation. (Tr. 64) \n \nApplicant submitted six affidavits from people who have known him and his work \nin the United States. (AX B, with 6 attachments) Each has had an opportunity to observe \nApplicant and do not believe he would succumb to foreign pressure. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nAdministrative Notice (Republic of India) \n \n \n \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s request, to which Applicant did not object, I have \ntaken administrative notice of the following relevant facts about the Republic of India: \n \n\uf0b7 The 2000 and 2008 Annual Reports to Congress on Foreign Economic \nCollection and Industrial Espionage identified India as being involved in \neconomic collection and industrial espionage.  \n \n\uf0b7 In June 2013, a member of parliament in India and a close advisor to a now-\ndeceased chief minister was among those indicted by the U.S. Department of \nJustice for allegedly soliciting bribes for himself and other government officials \nin India in return for approving licenses to mine titanium minerals. \n\uf0b7 As of March 2016, India continued to experience terrorist and insurgent \nactivities. Anti-Western terrorist groups active in India, some of which are on \nthe U.S. government\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations, include Islamist \nextremist groups Harkat-ul-Jihad, Harakat ul-Mujahidin, Indian Myjahideen, \nJaish-e-Mohammed, and Lashker-e Tayyiba. \n \n\uf0b7 As of 2015, the most significant human rights problems involved police and \nsecurity force abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and rape; \ncorruption remained widespread and contributed to ineffective responses to \ncrimes, including those against women, children, and members of scheduled \ncastes or tribes, and societal violence based on gender, religious affiliation, and \ncaste or tribe. Other human rights problems included disappearances, \nhazardous prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, and lengthy pretrial \ndetention. A lack of accountability for misconduct at all levels of government \npersisted, contributing to widespread impunity. \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.2 As noted \nby the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d3 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about \nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved \nin favor of protecting national security.  \n \n                                                          \n2 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to \na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a \nsecurity clearance).  \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n5 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.4 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.5 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 The Government has the burden of presenting evidence \nto establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.7 An applicant is \nresponsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that \nhave been admitted or proven.8 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9 \n \n \nIn Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a \npreponderance of evidence.10 The Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and \na judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \nThe security concern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is set out in AG \u00b6 6, \nas follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a  foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether it is \n                                                          \n4 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n5 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n7 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n8 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n9 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n10 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n11 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n\n6 \n \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nFour disqualifying conditions under this Guideline are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation \nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign  person, group, or country by providing that information or \ntechnology;  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement , manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s close family ties to his mother, father, brother and mother-in-law who \nare  citizens and residents of India, and his financial interest in India establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \n7(b), 7(e), and 7(f).  A \u201cheightened risk\u201d is associated with India, given the significant \nhuman rights and terrorism problems existent there, and its history of economic collection \nand industrial espionage. \n \nApplication of Guideline B is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely \nan acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices \nthat could be important to a loved one, such as a family member.12 Family relationships \ncan involve matters of influence or obligation.13 Therefore, Applicant\u2019s family ties with his \nwife\u2019s family, property ownership, and other financial interests in India raise concerns for \nwhich he has the burden of persuasion to mitigate.14   \n                                                          \n12 ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). \n \n13 ISCR Case No. 02-04786 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003). \n \n14 ISCR Case No. 99-0532 at 7 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2000) (When an applicant\u2019s ties in a foreign country raise \na prima facie security concern, the applicant is required to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation, or \nmitigation sufficient to carry his burden of persuasion that it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d \nto grant or continue a security clearance on his behalf). \n \n\n7 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under this Guideline are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or allegiance to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U. S. interest;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n \nFor the reasons set out in the discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e) and 7(f), above, \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Applicant has lived in the United States since 2007. He was \nnaturalized in 2016. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has two children who are \nU.S. citizens. Applicant speaks to his family members frequently. None of his family or in-\nlaws have connections to the Indian government.  \n \nApplicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. \nthat he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nThere is little likelihood that Applicant\u2019s communications with his family could create a risk \nfor foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant\u2019s Indian bank account is closed. He will give \nthe apartment property to his parents. His financial status in the United States far \noutweighs the financial interests in India. His Indian property is not worth as much as his \nliquid assets in the United States.  Applicant has substantial retirement and savings \naccounts in the United States. He owns a home in the United States.  Applicant\u2019s property \ninterest in India are such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used \neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. I find that mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b), 8(c), and 8(f) apply.  \n \n \n                                                          \n \n\n8 \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThe record does not create doubt about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.15 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion \nunder the foreign influence guideline to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n   For Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g:                    For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information.  \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a high energy laser program analyst with his current employer since May 2016. A 2008 high school graduate, Applicant attended several colleges and received college credits over a multi-year period, but did not earn a degree. He has never served with the U.S. military.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 18, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a set of interrogatories. On October 31, 2018, Applicant \nresponded to those interrogatories. On November 16, 2018, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD \n4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n03/29/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on November 27, 2018. In a notarized statement, \ndated January 8, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on February 6, 2019, \nand he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on February 13, 2019. \nHis response was due on March 15, 2019. Applicant timely submitted two documents in \nresponse to the FORM, and they were admitted without objection. The case was assigned \nto me on March 26, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with limited comments all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse of the SOR \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the \nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of \nfact:  \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a high energy laser program analyst with his current employer since May 2016. A 2008 \nhigh school graduate, Applicant attended several colleges and received college credits \nover a multi-year period, but did not earn a degree. He has never served with the U.S. \nmilitary. He has never been granted a security clearance. Applicant has never been \nmarried, but he apparently has a one-year-old daughter.  \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant was a substance abuser whose substances of choice were marijuana; \nunspecified opioids;1 hallucinogens,2 including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and \n                                                          \n1 Opioids are a class of drugs that include the illegal drug heroin, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, \nand pain relievers available legally by prescription, such as oxycodone (OxyContin\u00ae), hydrocodone \n(Vicodin\u00ae), codeine, morphine, and many others. See https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids \n \n2 Hallucinogens are a diverse group of drugs that alter perception (awareness of surrounding \nobjects and conditions), thoughts, and feelings. They cause hallucinations, or sensations and images that \nseem real though they are not. See https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/hallucinogens \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \npsilocybin mushrooms; stimulants, including cocaine, Adderall\u00ae,3 3,4-Methyl-enedioxy-\nmethamphetamine (MDMA),4 a synthetic drug commonly known as Ecstasy; Xanax, a \nbrand name for the drug alprazolam, used to treat anxiety and panic disorders; Klonopin, \na sedative used to treat seizures, panic disorder, and anxiety; and codeine cough syrup.5 \nSome of those substances are illegal, while others require prescriptions. \n \n \nApplicant has been smoking or eating marijuana on numerous occasions since \nJuly 2006, throughout high school and college, and he continued to do so at least until \nFebruary 2016. He purchased marijuana from his unnamed associates and unnamed \nfriends. He used marijuana with multiple individuals, in a variety of locations, including his \nfriends\u2019 apartments, and his car. His use increased over time from one time per month to \nup to two marijuana joints per day. Marijuana made him feel hungry and unmotivated, \nand it helped him forget about issues in his life. Applicant described his attachment to \nmarijuana as an emotional attachment. During his interview with an investigator from the \nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on May 10, 2018, Applicant stated that he \ndid not intend to use marijuana in the future, claiming that his motivation was driven by \nhis family, his daughter, and his maturity level.6   \n \nApplicant began snorting cocaine out of curiosity in March 2008 when he was in \nhigh school, and he continued doing so periodically, characterized by him as \u201conly a \nhandful of times,\u201d sometimes after lengthy periods of abstinence, until at least July 2014. \nHe was generally by himself when he used cocaine. He purchased the cocaine that he \nused. Cocaine made his heart race, and it made him sweaty and paranoid. Because he \nsaw no benefit in the continued use of cocaine, he decided to stop using it. During his \nOPM interview, Applicant made the same statement regarding future intent, motivation, \nand maturity level.7 \n   \nApplicant started using LSD and psilocybin mushrooms, also out of curiosity, in \nSeptember 2008, and he continued using the substances until at least January 2012, \nclaiming that there were sometimes periods of up to six months when he did not use them. \nHe obtained the LSD from friends, or he would harvest the mushrooms from cow feces in \n                                                          \n3 Adderall\u00ae is a prescription medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \nand narcolepsy. Adderall, a brand name, is a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, which \nare central nervous system stimulants, and can be habit-forming. See https://medicineplus.gov/druginfo/ \n \n4 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) is a synthetic drug that alters mood and \nperception (awareness of surrounding objects and conditions). It is chemically similar to both stimulants \nand hallucinogens, producing feelings of increased energy, pleasure, emotional warmth, and distorted \nsensory and time perception. See https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/mdma-ecstasymolly \n \n5 Codeine is a prescription opioid drug that treats mild pain and acts as a cough suppressant. \nCodeine cough syrup\u2019s main ingredient is a mild opioid narcotic, making it a target of abuse for people \nseeking narcotic highs. \n \n6 Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated May 10, 1018), at 5-6; Item 4 (e-QIP, dated July 18, \n2017), at 29-30, 36. \n \n7 Item 5, supra note 6, at 6; Item 4, supra note 6, at 31-32, 37. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nthe pasture. During his period of use, he estimated that he used LSD on two occasions \nand the mushrooms about \u201ca handful of times\u201d or ten times. LSD and the mushrooms \nmade him feel artistic and creative, seeing lots of colors, they slurred his speech, and \nthey made him feel as if he was dreaming while he was actually awake. During his OPM \ninterview, Applicant made the same statement regarding future intent, motivation, and \nmaturity level.8 \n \n Applicant started using Adderall\u00ae in September 2008, and he continued using it \n\u201ca few times\u201d until March 2015. It helped him focus for tests. The Adderall\u00ae was not \nprescribed for him, and a study partner provided it to him. The substance made him feel \nuncomfortable, sweaty, and anxious. He was given MDMA/Ecstacy by an unidentified \nacquaintance, and Applicant used it two times at parties during a one to two week period \nwhile he was at a particular university between August and December 2008. During his \nOPM interview, Applicant made the same statement regarding future intent, motivation, \nand maturity level.9 \n \nApplicant started using Xanax recreationally in October 2009, and he continued \ndoing so until at least January 2016, claiming that there were sometimes multi-year \nperiods when he did not use it. Although he claimed it was at one point prescribed for \nhim, he would usually purchase it off the street and would use one pill per day. He \nestimated that he used it \u201conly a handful of times.\u201d Xanax made him feel less anxious, \nand it enabled him to forget about his problems. Applicant acknowledged that the drug \ncreated relationship problems with his girlfriend. During his OPM interview, Applicant \nmade the same statement regarding future intent, motivation, and maturity level.10 \n \nApplicant initially admitted that he had experimented with both Xanax and Klonopin \non various occasions, described as \u201ca handful of times,\u201d between October 2009 and \nMarch 2015. He later amended that period and said it continued until January 2016. \nKlonopin, like Xanax, is a type of anti-anxiety medication that is classified as a \nbenzodiazepine, used to treat panic attacks and anxiety. Applicant stated during the OPM \ninterview that he was currently prescribed Klonopin, and that he was taking it as \nprescribed.11  \n \nApplicant sustained a football injury in November 2004, and as a result, he had \nsurgery, and his spleen was removed. He was prescribed hydrocodone12 and codeine \ncough syrup. Eventually, that period of prescribed use of such substances transitioned \ninto recreational use. He purchased and used various opioids, including Oxycodone,13 \n                                                          \n8 Item 5, supra note 6, at 6-7; Item 4, supra note 6, at 32-33, 37. \n \n9 Item 5, supra note 6, at 7; Item 4, supra note 6, at 10, 33-34, 38-39. \n \n10 Item 5, supra note 6, at 7; Item 4, supra note 6, at 10, 34-35, 38, 40. \n \n11 Item 5, supra note 6, at 7; Item 4, supra note 6, at 10, 34-35, 38, 40. \n \n12 Hydrocodone is a powerful painkiller prescribed for injury-related pain. \n \n13 Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opiate used for pain relief. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nrecreationally from November 2007, and continued doing so until at least January 2016. \nHe used two 30 milligram Oxycodone pills on a daily basis by snorting the drug either in \nhis room or in his car. The daily use continued because efforts to stop taking the drug \nresulted in his becoming violently sick from withdrawal. Opioids resulted in affecting his \nspeech and causing his pupils to become dilated. Applicant\u2019s opioid use initially gave him \na feeling of euphoria, but eventually it simply helped him to feel normal.14  \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant woke up in the hospital from an overdose of opioids.  During \nhis treatment, he was diagnosed with Opioid Use \u2013 Severe.15 He left treatment after nine \ndays without any prescribed medications and against medical advice because he felt as \nthough he was not being treated properly.16 Applicant claimed he sought alternate \nresource support with Narcotics Anonymous (NA) for an unspecified period, as well as \nSuboxone treatment from a physician.17  \n \n \nIn December 2018, one month after the SOR was issued, Applicant started seeing \na licensed clinical psychologist as part of an addiction program. In addition to the program, \nApplicant sees the psychologist in his private practice. Applicant has been participating \nin both group and individual therapy. Through the first three months of the program, \nApplicant has met all requirements with self-direction and without prompting from clinic \nstaff. He has successfully passed all drug screens, but does continue to have some \nchronic anxiety. Applicant has consistently been forthright and honest in treatment and in \nreporting previous drug use, \u201cwhich demonstrates a good treatment prognosis. He has \nbeen counseled about alcohol use and has decreased frequency and amount. Also per \nhis report, [Applicant] has completely discontinued marijuana use as well.\u201d18 \n \n \nIn his e-QIP, Applicant acknowledged his lengthy period of drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse:19 \n \n                                                          \n \n14 Item 5, supra note 6, at 6; Item 4, supra note 6, at 30-31, 36-37, 40. \n \n15 The appropriate terminology for the condition under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5 (2013), is Opioid Use Disorder \u2013 Severe, 304.00 (F11.20). Among \nthe diagnostic features of the disorder are \u201csigns and symptoms that reflect compulsive, prolonged self-\nadministration of opioid substances that are used for no legitimate medical purpose or, if another medical \ncondition is present that requires opioid treatment, that are used in doses greatly in excess of the amount \nneeded for that medical condition.\u201d \n \n16 Item 5, supra note 6, at 7; Item 4, supra note 6, at 41; Item 3 (Answer to the SOR, dated January \n8, 2019), at 2. \n \n17 Item 5, supra note 6, at 7; Item 4, supra note 6, at 41. Suboxone is a drug that contains \nbuprenorphine, and it is used to reduce symptoms of opiate addiction and withdrawal. See \nhttps://medicineplus.gov/druginfo/ \n \n18 Letter, dated March 11, 2019, submitted in response to the FORM. \n \n19 Item 4, supra note 6, at 30-35. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nI have made mistakes that I am extremely ashamed of, embarrassed of, \nand even disgusted with for making. Not only am I disgusted with my \nchoices in the past, I seek to right my wrongs and be a truly great \ncontributing member of society. I have made significant and drastic life \nchanges such as: cutting all ties with former associates, . . . and focusing \non my life and future, which includes my career and my family. . . . I cannot \nchange my past: I can only change my future.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d20 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d21   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d22 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \n                                                          \n20 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n21 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n22 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.23  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d24  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d25 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n                                                          \n23 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n24 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n25 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licenses clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder; and \n \n(e) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical or mental health professional. \n \nApplicant admittedly purchased,26 possessed and used (or misused) marijuana; \nopioids, including Oxycodone and codeine cough syrup; hallucinogens, including LSD \n                                                          \n26 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also \nISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. \nSept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unalleged conduct, \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nand psilocybin mushrooms; stimulants, including cocaine, Adderall\u00ae, MDMA, Xanax; and \nKlonopin. Before he left substance abuse treatment for a drug overdose, against medical \nadvice and without prescribed medication, he was diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder \u2013 \nSevere. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), 25(d), and 25(e) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) minimally apply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) do not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s lengthy history of drug involvement and substance misuse can be analyzed \nin two different ways: individually or as a combination, regardless of the individual \nsubstance. On an individual basis, it would appear that his use of cocaine, LSD, psilocybin \nmushrooms, Adderall\u00ae, and MDMA/Ecstacy were primarily experimentation or of a more \nlimited in frequency and duration. As to those substances, AG \u00b6 26(a) may have some \napplication. However, because of the frequency, duration, and relative recency of his use \nof marijuana, Xanax, Klonopin, and the various opioids, including Oxycodone and codeine \ncough syrup, AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. As to AG \u00b6 26(b), Applicant has acknowledged \nhis lengthy history of drug involvement and substance misuse with a plethora of \nsubstances, and claimed that he has disassociated from his drug-using associates and \ncontacts. However, there is only some relatively recent evidence, commencing after the \nSOR was issued, that indicates that he has taken some action to overcome his substance \nabuse problem. In fact, while Applicant eventually sought substance abuse treatment in \nDecember 2018, there is no mention of his earlier diagnosis of Opioid Use Disorder \u2013 \n                                                          \nsuch as his purchases and possession of various substances, will be considered only for the five purposes \nlisted above.  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nSevere, and how that condition is being treated. Recognizing that Applicant\u2019s abuse of \nOxycodone and codeine cough syrup started sometime after those medications were \ninitially prescribed for him following a severe illness or injury, his continued misuse of \nthose substances removes that misuse from consideration of AG \u00b6 26(c). \n \nFinally, there is the absence of clinical records regarding his abuse of opioids and \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fully explain his premature departure from treatment against medical \nadvice, and his failure to furnish documentary evidence pertaining to his purported \nSuboxone treatment. While Applicant\u2019s purported periods of abstinence from illegal and \nauthorized substances is to be encouraged, considering the lengthy period of his overall \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, even accepting Applicant\u2019s stated periods of \nsuch abstinence, the periods of abstinence are simply too brief to establish confidence \nthat a relapse will not occur. Under the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s actions continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.27  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 29-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a high energy laser program \nanalyst with his current employer since May 2016. A 2008 high school graduate, Applicant \nreceived a number of college credits over a multi-year period, but did not earn a degree. \nHe has purportedly been abstinent from those illegal or misused substances over a \nstaggered period. \n \n                                                          \n27 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant admittedly purchased, possessed and used, or misused, marijuana; opioids, \nincluding Oxycodone and codeine cough syrup; hallucinogens, including LSD and \npsilocybin mushrooms; stimulants, including cocaine, Adderall\u00ae, MDMA, Xanax; and \nKlonopin \u2013 all against the law. Before he left substance abuse treatment in 2015 for a \ndrug overdose, against medical advice and without prescribed medication, he was \ndiagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder \u2013 Severe. Although he was treated for the opioid \noverdose in 2015, it was not until December 2018 \u2013 two and one-half years later \u2013 that \nhe sought treatment for substance abuse. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Abuse. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.f., and 1.h.: Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c. through 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant (included in 1.a.) \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.a-2.o. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 3.b. He did not specifically admit or deny the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a, which cross-alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old sheet metal worker employed by a defense contractor since November 2016. He served in the U.S. Navy from March 2003 to September 2016. While on active duty, he received nonjudicial punishment for misuse of a government credit card by buying dinner for family members. (FORM Item 2 at 46.) He was reduced from petty officer first class (E-6) to petty officer second class (E-5) and restricted to the barracks for 21 days. (FORM Item 3, Personal Subject Interview in February 2018 (PSI) at 6.) On April 30, 2013, Applicant\u2019s wife sought treatment at a military medical facility for neck pain. She told a member of the medical staff that Applicant had choked her during an argument. She declined to make a written statement. Applicant was interviewed and admitted grabbing her by the neck on several occasions during arguments in March and April 2013.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines J (Criminal \nConduct), F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 10, \n2016. On October 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines J, F, and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nin Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 8, 2018, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \n03/07/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nwritten case on November 30, 2018. On December 7, 2018, a complete copy of the file \nof relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on December 17, 2018, and did not respond. The \ncase was assigned to me on February 12, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n2.a-2.o. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 3.b. He did not specifically \nadmit or deny the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a, which cross-alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, \nand 2.b. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old sheet metal worker employed by a defense contractor \nsince November 2016. He served in the U.S. Navy from March 2003 to September \n2016. While on active duty, he received nonjudicial punishment for misuse of a \ngovernment credit card by buying dinner for family members. (FORM Item 2 at 46.) He \nwas reduced from petty officer first class (E-6) to petty officer second class (E-5) and \nrestricted to the barracks for 21 days. (FORM Item 3, Personal Subject Interview in \nFebruary 2018 (PSI) at 6.)  \n \n \nOn April 30, 2013, Applicant\u2019s wife sought treatment at a military medical facility \nfor neck pain. She told a member of the medical staff that Applicant had choked her \nduring an argument. She declined to make a written statement. Applicant was \ninterviewed and admitted grabbing her by the neck on several occasions during \narguments in March and April 2013. He was required to obtain counseling and attend an \nanger management course. No disciplinary or criminal action was taken.  \n \n \nIn June 2016, Applicant was arrested for felony embezzlement. He was working \npart time at a department store and he bought multiple items, including a television set \nand cellphone, on layaway. He entered false information into the store\u2019s data system \nreflecting that he was making payments on the items. He also took cash totaling about \n$800 from a cash register. When he was interviewed by store investigators in June \n2016, he attributed his criminal conduct to financial problems caused by his reduced \nincome after he was demoted for misconduct. (FORM Item 5.)  \n \n \nIn April 2017, Applicant was convicted of felony embezzlement from the \ndepartment store. He was sentenced to 121 days in jail and placed on probation for \nthree years, until April 2020. He was ordered to pay restitution of $4,860. He was fired \nfrom his part-time job and prohibited from entering the store\u2019s premises. (FORM Item 6 \nat 3; FORM Item 7.) In the PSI and Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that the \noffense was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor after he made restitution. There \nare no court documents in the record reflecting a reduction of the offense to a \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nmisdemeanor. In September 2016, he was discharged from the Navy with an \u201cother \nthan honorable\u201d discharge. He was unemployed after his discharge until he was hired \nfor his current job. He has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant has taken college courses since October 2016 but has not received a \ndegree. He married in December 2004, divorced in April 2007, and married his current \nspouse in December 2011. He has a seven-year-old son and three stepchildren, ages \n21, 17, and 11. \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.o alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling about $33,000, which \nare reflected in credit reports from March 2017 (FORM Item 9) and November 2018 \n(FORM Item 10). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.k: two unsecured loans from the same creditor charged \noff for $9,454 and $3,051. The November 2018 credit report reflects that both accounts \nare current. (FORM Item 10 at 4.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: account past due for $3,418. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he \nclaimed that this debt was paid, but he submitted no documentation to support his \nclaim.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: credit-card account placed for collection of $452. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he submitted documentary evidence showing that he was making \npayments on this debt. \n \n \nApplicant submitted no evidence of payments, payment agreements, or other \nresolution of the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d (unsecured loan placed for \ncollection of $6,372); \u00b6 1.e (unsecured loan past due for $3,556); \u00b6 1.h (medical bill \nplaced for collection of $264); \u00b6 1.i (credit-card account charged off for $423); \u00b6 1.j \n(dental bill placed for collection of $235); \u00b6 1.l (unsecured loan charged off for $4,464); \u00b6 \n1.m (unsecured loan placed for collection of $1,257); \u00b6 1.n (credit-card account placed \nfor collection of $468), and \u00b6 1.o (credit-card account placed for collection of $479).  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in November 2016, he did not disclose any of \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. He disclosed his misuse of the government credit card \nand an unalleged delinquent car loan for $10,000 that was resolved by repossession. \nHe answered \u201cno\u201d to all the questions in Section 26, which included questions asking if, \nin the past seven years, he had defaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts turned \nover to a collection agency; had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or \ncancelled for failing to pay as agreed; or had been over 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt not previously entered. (FORM Item 2 at 47-49.) In the PSI, he did not disclose the \ndelinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.o until the investigator confronted him with the \nevidence. (PSI at 11.) In his answer to the SOR, he denied intentionally falsifying his \nSCA, claiming that he was confused by the questions. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n \n5 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in May 2013 and charged with \ndomestic assault (SOR \u00b6 1.a); arrested in September 2013 and charged with domestic \nbattery (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and was arrested in June 2016, charged with felony burglary, \nconvicted of embezzlement, and sentenced to 121 days in jail and probation for three \nyears, until April 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.c).  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is partially established by Applicant\u2019s admission that he choked his \nspouse during arguments on several occasions during March and April 2013, but there \nis no evidence that he was arrested or formally charged. There is no evidence in the \nrecord supporting SOR \u00b6 1.b. SOR \u00b6 1.c is established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nthe documentary evidence in the record. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d  \n \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted;  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less \nthan \"Honorable.\" \n\n \n6 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nThe above mitigating conditions are not established. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct \nwas recent and did not occur under unusual circumstances. Disposition of the criminal \ncharges was pending when he submitted his SCA, and he is still on probation until April \n2020. He presented no evidence of his duty performance in his current job or evidence \nof community involvement. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s conviction and sentencing for embezzlement \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) and his nonjudicial punishment for misusing a government credit card \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b). It also alleges 13 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c-2.o). \n \n \nThe evidence establishes that the delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and \n2.k are current, and that Applicant is making payments on the delinquent debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.g. He presented no evidence of payments, payment agreements, or other \nresolution of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d-2.f, 2.h-2.j, or 2.l-2.o.  \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(d): deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s misuse of a government credit card, \nembezzlement from an employer, and delinquent consumer debts are recent, \nnumerous, and did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s income reduction while on active duty \nand his loss of a second job were due to his own misconduct. He submitted no evidence \nof any conditions that were largely beyond his control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and his financial problems are not yet under control. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, \nand 1.k. It is not established for the other delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has made some progress \nin resolving his delinquent debts, but he has not yet established a track record of \nresponsible financial conduct. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 2.b. SOR \u00b6 3.b alleges that \nApplicant falsified his SCA by not disclosing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d-2.o. The \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not disclosing his delinquent debts in his SCA is \nimplausible and unconvincing. The only delinquent debt he disclosed in his SCA was a \ncar repossession that had been resolved. He knew that he was in financial distress. \nDuring his part-time employer\u2019s investigation of his embezzlement in June 2016, five \nmonths before he submitted his SCA, he attributed his criminal conduct to his financial \nproblems after his demotion for misconduct. His intentional failure to disclose his \ndelinquent debts in his SCA establishes the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a):  \n \n[Deliberate] omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s domestic assault in May 2013, misuse of a government credit card in \nJune 2015, and embezzlement in 2016 establish the following disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; . . .(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and (4) evidence of significant misuse of \nGovernment or other employer's time or resources; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not provide any information about the \ndelinquent debts until he was confronted with the evidence during the PSI. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsification was arguably infrequent, \nbut it was recent and did not happen under unique circumstances. Falsification of an \nSCA is not minor, because it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, F, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted filing for bankruptcy protection three times, and admitted Federal income tax debts for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2016, but stated her tax returns for 2014, 2015, and 2016 had been filed. She asserted one credit report indicated the debts in SOR 1.i, SOR 1.j, SOR 1.k, and SOR 1.l were reported as paid in full with zero balances. Other credit reports do not show the debts as paid. She indicated the debts in SOR 1.h and SOR 1.m through SOR 1.r are included in her Chapter 13, Wage Earners\u2019 Plan bankruptcy. She stated she owes nothing on the judgment listed in SOR 1.s ($8,598), which involves the same creditor as the debt listed in SOR 1.h ($19,182). She did not explain why she no longer owed the delinquent obligations. She stated that in the current year, she anticipates she and her husband\u2019s gross income for 2019 will be more than $275,000. (SOR Response) After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 44-year-old engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since January 2018 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. (Ex. 2, Tr. 31, 44) She held a secret clearance while working for a defense contractor from 2003 to 2013. (Ex. 1, 2, Tr. 5) From April 2013 to January 2017 and from May 2017 to September 2017, she was unemployed. (Ex. 2) She has not served in the U.S. military.

Between 2014 and December \n2018, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection three times. The most recent bankruptcy \nplan was confirmed in June 2019. She filed her 2015 and 2016 Federal income tax returns \nlate and owes more than $100,000 in Federal income taxes. She provided false answers \non her February 2018 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). \nShe has not mitigated the financial considerations or personal conduct security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn January 11, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct, under which it \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for her.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nThe DoD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn February 5, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On March 21, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing that \nwas conducted on April 9, 2019.  \n \nNine Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 9) and three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A \u2013 C) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Documents submitted by Applicant as \nattachments to her SOR answer were also considered. Applicant and her spouse testified, \nas reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on April 18, 2019. The record was held open \nfollowing the hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. Five additional \nsubmissions were received and admitted into evidence, without objections, as Ex. D \u2013 H. \nThose documents were received between April 2019 and late June 2019 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted filing for bankruptcy protection \nthree times, and admitted Federal income tax debts for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2016, \nbut stated her tax returns for 2014, 2015, and 2016 had been filed. She asserted one \ncredit report indicated the debts in SOR 1.i, SOR 1.j, SOR 1.k, and SOR 1.l were reported \nas paid in full with zero balances. Other credit reports do not show the debts as paid.

She stated she owes nothing on the judgment listed \nin SOR 1.s ($8,598), which involves the same creditor as the debt listed in SOR 1.h \n($19,182). She did not explain why she no longer owed the delinquent obligations. She \nstated that in the current year, she anticipates she and her husband\u2019s gross income for \n2019 will be more than $275,000. (SOR Response) After a thorough review of the \npleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since \nJanuary 2018 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. (Ex. 2, Tr. 31, 44) She held a \nsecret clearance while working for a defense contractor from 2003 to 2013. (Ex. 1, 2, Tr. \n5) From April 2013 to January 2017 and from May 2017 to September 2017, she was \nunemployed. (Ex. 2) She has not served in the U.S. military. She is married, has a step-\ndaughter age 25, and three children ages 9, 8, and 6. (Ex. 2) In May 2002, she obtained \na master\u2019s degree in engineering. (Ex. 3, Tr. 13) Her annual salary is $145,000. (Tr. 61) \nHer husband currently has three jobs, one with an $185,000 annual salary and the other \ntwo positions paying between $15,000 and $45,000 annually. (Tr. 62) He also receives \nbook royalties. Between 2014 and December 2018, Applicant and her husband filed for \nbankruptcy protection three times. (Ex. 5, 6, 7) \n \n\n \n3 \nIn 2008, Applicant purchased a house on the east coast and lived in the home until \nMarch 2014. (Tr. 114) At that time, the home was rented to a friend who live there until \n2015. In 2015, Applicant and her spouse moved from the east coast to their current \nlocation. (Tr. 24) When Applicant asked her husband about the status of the home, he \ntold her it had been sold. However, it had not been sold, but went to foreclosure. (Tr. 115) \nHer husband had used a power of attorney from Applicant in dealing with the house.  \n \nIn 2013, when Applicant\u2019s maternity leave ended following the birth of her third \nchild, she chose to take time off from her job with a defense contractor to take care of her \nthree children. (Tr. 6, 35) Her oldest child was age four, and she had recently learned her \nsecond child has autism and learned her spouse also has autism. (Tr. 17, 34, 100) When \nshe resigned, her annual salary was approximately $120,000. (Tr. 35) Shortly after \nApplicant had resigned from her job, her spouse was laid off from his job with a defense \ncontractor when the contract he was working on ended. (Tr. 6) Applicant was not \nintimately involved with the family\u2019s finances. (Ex. 17) In their household, her husband \nhandled the payment of bills. (Tr. 32) Whenever she asked her husband about their debts, \nshe was told everything was \u201csquared away,\u2019\u201d and when she asked about their tax returns, \nhe stated \u201cYes, I\u2019m on top of it. I sent it in.\u201d (Tr. 46) In her August 2018 interview, she \nstated she trusted her husband 100 percent and had no idea where their income was \nused. (Ex. 3) \n \nFrom April 2012 through December 2016, during the time Applicant was at home \nwith her children, their joint household income exceeded $300,000. (Ex. F, Tr. 63) \nApplicant\u2019s and her spouse\u2019s 2014 Federal income tax return was timely filed on March \n3, 2015. (Ex. F) In February 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and submitted copies \nof their 2015 and 2016 Federal tax returns dated October 2017, both of which would have \nbeen late filings. (SOR Response, Tr. 71) The tax transcripts show their 2015 Federal \nincome tax return was filed in March 2018 and their 2016 Federal income tax return was \nfiled February 2018. (Ex. G, Tr. 72) Applicant\u2019s husband asserted that, in the past, he had \nestablished payment plans with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The plans were not \nfurther explained in the record. (Tr. 74)  \n \nThe copy of Applicant\u2019s 2016 Federal tax return submitted with her response to the \nSOR indicates wages of $340,475 and an adjusted gross income of $322,715 with \n$10,483 of Federal income tax withheld. The 2016 tax transcript stated the Federal \nincome tax liability was $71,736 plus $2,165 interest charged for late payment. (Ex. G) \n \nIn October 2018, when Applicant submitted her response to written interrogatories, \nshe submitted a copy of an unsigned and undated 2017 joint Federal tax return. (Ex 3) A \ntax transcript for tax year 2017 is not contained in the record. A May 10, 2019 letter from \nthe IRS indicated a request for a 2017 transcript had been received, but the IRS could \nnot process the request at that time. (Ex. F) The 2017 tax return she presented in \nresponse to the written interrogatories indicated $6,847 in wages and a business loss of \n$40,436, which was listed as wages paid an assistant. (Ex. 3) Information about this loss \ndue to a paid assistant is not contained in the record. The return lists an adjusted gross \nincome of $2,472, and $356 in Federal income tax withheld. (Ex. 3) The return also claims \n\n \n4 \n$36,061 income listed on a 1099 MISC, not further explained. Based on the return they \nanticipated an $880 refund. (Ex. 3)  \n \n In the October 2017 bankruptcy filing, Applicant and her husband claimed monthly \nincome of $12,061. (Ex. 5, page 35 of 43) She did not explain why the bankruptcy for \nlisted $12,061 in monthly income but their joint Federal tax return lists a total income for \nthe year of $6,847. During 2017, Applicant was unemployed from May 2017 to September \n2017. During that year, a contract her husband had been working on ended, and he \nbecame involved with a number of start-up companies. (Tr. 97) Her husband received \nlittle compensation for his work with the start-up companies. (Tr. 97) As previously stated, \nher husband also receives royalties from a number of books he has written. (Tr. 99)  \n \nApplicant asserts she had difficulties receiving her mail at times. In February 2019, \nshe was very surprised when she received the bills for her son\u2019s medical treatment. (Tr. \n23) The company said they had sent invoices for $3,704 for medical treatment provided \nbetween May 2018 and October 2018. (Ex. B) Applicant claimed the invoices were never \nreceived. In March 2019, the company was paid $1,904 for services received. (Ex. B) She \nasserts a similar event occurred over a bill for pool service. She claims she never received \na $1,380 invoice for pool services before being sued by the pool company for unpaid \nservices. Once notified, the debt was paid in March 2019. (Ex. C) She has asserted that \nshe had not received mail sent to her including Christmas cards. (Ex. C) Applicant \nobtained a post office box to alleviate the mail problem. (Tr. 108)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant asserted for 2016 their household income was $340,000 \nwith $10,000 being withheld to pay Federal income tax. (Tr. 9) This left a tax balance due \nof $60,000. In January 2019, Applicant and her spouse agreed to pay $495,590 through \na Chapter 13, Wage Earners\u2019 Plan, with payments of approximately $8,200 per month. \n(Tr. 9, 28) The amount to be paid in the plan varied greatly depending on which \nbankruptcy documents are reviewed. The monthly payment also includes mortgage and \nvehicle payments in additional to payment on the Federal tax bill. Applicant anticipated \nshe and her husband\u2019s household income for 2019 would total approximately $275,000. \n(Tr. 9)  \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s 2009 e-QIP, she did not list any financial difficulties because at the \ntime she was not experiencing any financial problems. (Ex. 1) In November 2017, an \n$8,598 civil judgment was entered against Applicant, which she did not list on her \nFebruary 2018 e-QIP. (Ex. 2, 7) On the same e-QIP, she listed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nfiled in October 2017, but failed to list her October 2014 bankruptcy filing. In the e-QIP, \nshe stated, \u201cI have no debt under my name and was cleared of all debt.\u201d (Ex. 2) She \nanswered \u201cno\u201d when asked if she had failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes, \nand she did not list any delinquencies involving routine accounts. She indicated \u201cno\u201d in \nFebruary 2018, when asked about the non-filing of taxes even though she had attended \nthe October 2017 bankruptcy debtors\u2019 meeting where the IRS debt of more than $100,000 \nwas discussed. She asserted she believed all the debts had been satisfied. \n \n\n \n5 \nIn Applicant\u2019s October 2018 Response to Written Interrogatories, she indicated all \nher debts had been either addressed or were being addressed. (Ex. 3) She did not explain \nor provide documentation showing the debts were being addressed. At the time of her \nFebruary 2018 e-QIP response, the 2017 bankruptcy had not yet been dismissed. \n \nIn October 2014, Applicant and her husband (debtors) jointly filed for bankruptcy \nprotection under Chapter 13, the Wage Earner\u2019s Plan. The bankruptcy listed $42,327 in \nsecured claims and $75,198 in unsecured claims, which totaled $117,526. (Ex. 4) The \nunsecured claims included some of the SOR delinquent obligations: SOR 1.j ($9,086), \nSOR 1.k ($8,237), SOR 1.n ($5,245), SOR 1.o ($1,583), and SOR 1.p ($767). (Ex. 4) At \nthat time mortgage arrearages were $21,988 on a $275,254 mortgage. The house \neventually went to foreclosure. No principal or interest were paid on the claims. In May \n2015, the debtors were dismissed and in October 2015, the bankruptcy terminated. (Ex. \n4) The debtor\u2019s requested a voluntary dismissal. When a Chapter 13 case is dismissed, \nthe debts are not discharged. (Ex. 5)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2018 Enhanced Subject Interview, she indicated she had no \nknowledge that a bankruptcy had been filed in October 2014. (Ex. 3) During the interview, \nwhen asked about delinquent obligations on her credit report, she had no knowledge \nabout the following delinquent obligations: SOR 1.i, $439; SOR 1.j, $9,086; SOR 1.k, \n$28,237; SOR1.n, $5,245; SOR 1.o, $1,583; SOR 1.p, $767; and SOR 1.r, $6,761. (Ex. \n3) She indicated the $3,206 (SOR 1.l) automobile debt may have been for a car \npurchased for her step-daughter. (Ex. 3, Tr. 85) The vehicle was repossessed. (Ex. 9, Tr. \n82) The last payment before repossession occurred in 2016. (Ex. 9, Tr. 84) She did not \ndisclose any repossessions on her February 2018 e-QIP. (Ex. 2) \n \nApplicant believes a $19,182 delinquent obligation (SOR 1.h) was unpaid or \noverdue rent owed an apartment complex. (Ex. 7, Tr. 39) She has not investigated the \ndebt and only learned of it during the security clearance process. (Tr. 35) It was included \nin her 2017 bankruptcy filing. (Tr. 60) The debt in SOR 1.h ($19,182) and judgement in \nSOR 1.s ($8,598) are with the same corporation that owns apartment complexes \nthroughout the country. However, the debt in SOR 1.h is for unpaid rent on a rental unit \non the east coast and the debt in SOR 1.s is for an apartment in the state where Applicant \ncurrently resides. (Tr. 87) Their bankruptcy attorney has asked the corporation for an \naccounting of the two debts. (Tr. 87) No information was received concerning the results \nof the request for accounting.  \n \nApplicant had no knowledge about the $28,237 charged off debt (SOR 1.k). (Tr. \n78) An automobile was purchased for $33,000 and $23,000 was charged-off to profits \nand losses. (Ex. 8, Tr. 79) The vehicle debt was never paid, but Applicant believes her \ncredit report reflects a zero balance on the debt. (Tr. 80) Applicant asserts the $6,761 \njoint travel card debt (SOR 1.r) is included in the bankruptcy. (Tr. 86)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated she did not find out about the 2014 filing until the \nsecond bankruptcy was filed in October 2017. (Ex. 3, Tr. 40) She did not explain how she \nfailed to know about the joint filing. She testified when she found out about the 2014 filing, \n\n \n6 \nshe asserted she was very angry with her husband for filing under her name, without her \nknowledge, and asserted that she never having signed any paperwork. (Tr. 42) When she \ndiscovered the 2014 bankruptcy had been filed, she did not review the filing. (Tr. 43) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s June 2018 Enhanced Subject Interview, which was seven months after \nthe October 2017 bankruptcy filing, she stated she had no knowledge of any such action \nbeing filed in 2014. (Ex. 3)  \n \nIn October 2017, Applicant and her husband filed for bankruptcy protection under \nChapter 13, Wage Earner\u2019s Plan. Applicant never contacted the bankruptcy attorney or \nverified the status of the bankruptcy after the initial filing. (Tr. 45) The bankruptcy listed \nassets of approximately $30,000, secured debt of approximately $35,000, and unsecured \ndebt of $225,000. (Ex. 5, page 41) A $102,564 student loan debt was listed in the \nbankruptcy filing. (Ex. 5, pages 30 and 42) Their household\u2019s monthly income was \napproximately $12,000 with monthly expenses of $6,000. (Ex. 5 pages 35 and 36) The \nprojected monthly Chapter 13 plan payment was $788. (Ex. 5) The plan listed no real \nestate and listed two vehicles valued at $35,000. Approximately $18,000 of the motor \nvehicle debt was unsecured. (Ex. 5, pages 16-18 of 43) \n \nApplicant was surprised in March 2018, when her husband told her the bankruptcy \nfiled in October 2017 was being dismissed. (Ex. 5, Tr. 52) She asked her husband how \nthe debts ($225,091) had been dismissed in the six months, from October 2017 to March \n2018. When informed the bankruptcy was dismissed, Applicant was under the erroneous \nimpression that the process was over and they were then debt free. (Tr. 52) Her husband \ntold her he had paid $500 a month for six months and the debts were dismissed. The \ndismissal was due to Applicant and her spouse failing to cooperate with the bankruptcy \ntrustee as necessary to enable the trustee to perform the trustee\u2019s duties. (Ex. 3)  \n \nApplicant and her spouse object to the IRS\u2019s claim of a $179,774 tax delinquency. \n(Ex. 5) The IRS claimed a priority claim of $62,920 and an unsecured claim of $45,255. \nApplicant first saw, the history of the October 2017 bankruptcy filing documents (Ex. 5) at \nthe hearing. (Tr. 47) Applicant\u2019s husband believes they owe the IRS $130,000. (Tr. 64) \nApplicant testified she knew in October 2017 there was a tax debt, but did not know the \ndetails of the debt even though they reviewed the bankruptcy filing, line by line, with their \nbankruptcy attorney. (Tr. 47) A representative from the IRS attended the debtors\u2019 \nconference. (Tr. 47) In a post-hearing submission, she asserted that her 2016 and 2017 \ntax returns were \u201cbeing reviewed due to them [IRS] concluding we were the victims of ID \nTheft.\u201d (Ex. F) She did not make this claim at the hearing and provided no documentation \nfrom the IRS supporting her assertion of review by the IRS. \n \nThe IRS wage and income transcripts in evidence presented indicate Applicant\u2019s \nand her spouse\u2019s joint income between 2009 and 2018 was not lower than $129,000. (Ex. \nF) Joint income: in 2012 was $203,809; in 2013, $312,737; in 2014, $129,190; in 2015, \n$134,703; in 2018, $154,783; and for tax year 2016, an adjusted gross income of \n$322,715. (Ex. F, G) The tax transcript for tax year 2014 indicated $1,052 in Federal tax \nwas owed. (Ex. F) In April 2018, the IRS sent Applicant and her spouse a Notice of Intent \n\n \n7 \nto seize (levy) on their property and that $1,825 was immediately due for tax year 2014. \n(Ex. 3)  \n \nIn 2015, Applicant and her spouse moved to a state that does not have a state \nindividual income tax. No information was alleged or presented concerning any state \nincome taxes owed at their previous state of residence. An IRS tax account transcript for \ntax year 2016 indicated $71,736 in Federal tax was owed and $10,483 had been withheld. \n(Ex. G) This left a balance due of $61,253 plus $2,165 interest on the late payment, for a \ntotal due of $63,418. (Ex. G) In May 2019, the IRS sent notification that Applicant and her \nspouse\u2019s $880 refund for tax year 2017 had been intercepted and applied to her 2013 tax \ndebt. (Ex. G) This left a tax debt of $47,008 for tax year 2013. (Ex. G) \n \nIn December 2018, Applicant and her husband again filed for bankruptcy \nprotection under Chapter 13. (Ex. 6, the document indicated it is 46 pages, but the record \nfails to contain 46 pages for this document). The bankruptcy listed a secured claim for a \nhome valued at $575,000 with monthly mortgage payments of $5,702 and two secured \nclaims for motor vehicles valued at $52,000. (Ex. C, Ex. 6, page 9 and 10 of 46) At the \ndate of filing, Applicant\u2019s husband believed the mortgage was current, but did not explain \nhow it was $28,000 delinquent in earlier filings and was current at the time of filing. They \nowed approximately $200 more on the home than the value of the house. The plan listed \nassets of $666,400 and liabilities of $648,076. (Ex. 6, page 34) Unsecured debt totaled \n$24,712. (Ex. 6, page 5 of 13) The amount of student loan debt is not listed in the 2018 \nbankruptcy documents. The fact that student loans are not normally dischargeable in \nbankruptcy may explain the reason the student loan debt is not listed in the latest \nbankruptcy filing. \n \nBankruptcy documents dated January 2019 reflect the projected monthly Chapter \n13 plan payment started at $8,259 per month and will increased over the five years of the \nplan to $15,275 monthly. (Ex. C) Her husband stated the monthly payment is \nautomatically deducted from his and his wife\u2019s pay. (Tr. 99) Applicant asserted that \nfollowing the hearing, she would provide documentation showing timely payment of the \nmonthly payment. (Tr. 117)  \n \nIn June 2019, the bankruptcy plan was confirmed. The order confirming the \nChapter 13 plan states the debtors (Applicant and her spouse) will pay $719,520 over a \n60 month period starting in January 2019. (Ex. H) Monthly payments are to start at $8,260 \nmonthly, to increase to $11,000 monthly in January 2020, increase to $12,500 monthly in \nJanuary 2021, and then increase to $14,000 monthly in January 2022 until the 60-month \nplan is completed. (Ex. H) The majority of the monthly payment would go to the secured \ndebts, which would include the $5,702 monthly mortgage payment, the car payments for \nthe two cars, and the IRS debt. In February 2019, a wage directive information sheet \ndirected Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s employer to deduct $6,000 per month or $2,768 bi-weekly \nand the amount was to be paid to the bankruptcy trustee. (Ex. D) A similar directive to \nApplicant\u2019s employer directed that $2,260 monthly or $1,043 bi-weekly be withheld and \npaid to the trustee (Ex. D)  \n \n\n \n8 \nAt the hearing, Applicant submitted bank statements showing payment to the \nbankruptcy trustee of approximately $260 each on January 28, 2019, February 5, 2019, \nFebruary 19, 2019, March 1, 2019, March 18, 2019, and on April 1, 2019. (Ex. B) These \nsix payments total $1,560. Following the hearing, Applicant submitted leave and earning \nstatements from her employer for March, April, May, and June 2019 showing the \ndeductions from her pay that were sent to the bankruptcy trustee (Ex. D, E, G) As of June \n6, 2016, $7,301 had been deducted from Applicant\u2019s pay. No leave and earning \ndocuments were submitted showing deductions from her husband\u2019s pay, but a bankruptcy \ndocument showed her husband\u2019s employer had submitted five payments totaling $16,836 \nin January through March 2019, plus one payment by him, with all of the payments on his \nbehalf totaling $36,438. (Ex. D) During the same period, Applicant\u2019s employer. The \ncombined payments totaled $53,274. From February through May 2019, Applicant \nsubmitted cashier\u2019s checks to the trustee totaling $24,491. (Ex. D, E) From January 2019 \nthrough June 2019, Applicant has documented payments of $86,626 to the bankruptcy \ntrustee from January 2019 through June 2019. (Ex. D, E, G)  \n \nIn December 2018, Applicant\u2019s household\u2019s monthly income was $26,900 with \nmonthly expenses of approximately $10,000. (Ex. 6, page 2 and 3 of 12) The projected \nmonthly Chapter 13 plan payment started at $8,259 per month and increased over the \ncourse of the plan to $15,275 monthly. (Ex. 6, page 2 of 13) Their monthly home mortgage \npayment was $5,700 and the IRS monthly payment was $950 on an amount owed of \n$145,807. (Ex. 6, page 4 of 13, Ex. C) The IRS submitted a priority claim of $62,920 and \nan unsecured claim of $45,255. The record does not reconcile the discrepancy in the tax \ndelinquency claimed by the IRS.  \n \nDuring their December 2018 bankruptcy filing, Applicant and her husband sought \nthe services of a tax accountant. (Tr. 49) Her husband hired the tax accountant, and \nApplicant did not know the details of the hiring, actions taken by the tax accountant, or \nthe results obtained. (Tr. 50) Bankruptcy documents also show the IRS was claiming \nApplicant and her husband owed a lesser amount of $120,303 in taxes. (Ex. E) That \namount represents a secured claim of $43,076, an unsecured priority claim of $66,001, \nan unsecured claim for interest of $5,151, and an unsecured claim for tax penalty of \n$5,450. The difference in values claimed was not further delineated in the record.  \n \nIn January 2019, the Applicant\u2019s and her spouse\u2019s Chapter 13 Plan listed $83,093 \nunsecured debt, which included all of the SOR charged-off and collection accounts except \nfor the $9,986 charged-off bank debt (SOR 1.j). (Ex. C) The plan included: SOR 1.h and \n1.s, $27,780; SOR 1.i, $439; SOR 1.k, $28,237; SOR 1.m, $922; SOR 1.n, $5,245; SOR \n1.o, $1,583; SOR 1.p, $767; SOR 1.q, $669; and SOR 1.r, $6,761. (Ex. C)The unsecured \nclaims also include a $3,459 hospital debt not listed as a debt of concern in the SOR. The \nJune 11, 2019 Order Confirming the Chapter 13 plan lists the secured creditors by name, \nbut does not specifically list the unsecured creditor by name. (Ex. H) \n \nIn March 2019, the bankruptcy court ordered Applicant and her spouse to complete \nan instructional course in personal financial management. She indicated that she had to \ntake a four-hour credit counseling class for the bankruptcy. (Ex. 3) \n\n \n9 \nApplicant has opened a separate checking account for her salary to which her \nhusband does not have access. (Tr. 3, 50) They ended their joint accounts. They no \nlonger have credit cards, only debit cards. (Tr. 50) She asserted that she is now \u201cintimately \ninvolved in paying the bills and making sure that they\u2019re paid and that we get confirmation \nof payment received.\u201d (Tr. 102) To reduce expenses, they have dismissed their part-time \nnanny and a tutor. (Tr.121) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant submitted several Performance and Development Summaries showing \nher job assessment, her key strengths, and performance ratings. (Ex. A) For 2003 and \n2012 she was rated as \u201cMeets Requirements,\u201d for 2004, 2009, 2010, and 2011 her rating \nwas \u201cExceeds Requirements,\u201d and for 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 she was rated as \u201cFar \nExceeds Requirements.\u201d Her 2018 rating was \u201cHighly Effective Contribution.\u201d (Ex. A)  \n \nApplicant is a deputy team lead recently promoted to section manager, where she \nwill be the direct supervisor of 12 to 15 engineers. (Ex. H) Her team lead, who has worked \nwith Applicant for a year and a half, stated Applicant consistently delivers on her \ncommitments without fail. (Ex. H) Their team of 40 individuals values accountability, \ntransparency, integrity, and commitment. The team lead states Applicant exemplifies \nthese values. (Ex. H) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n\n \n10 \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed-upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage her finances to meet her financial obligations. \nApplicant did not timely file her Federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 and \n2016. Those returns were filed in 2018. Applicant acknowledged owing more than \n\n \n11 \n$100,000 in Federal income tax. Guideline F security concerns are established when an \nindividual fails to comply with her tax filing obligations. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f), \n\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d applies. \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances were such that she had to file with her spouse for bankruptcy \nprotection in 2014, 2017, and 2018. The latest plan was filed in December 2018 and \nconfirmed in June 2019. In November 2017, a civil judgment of $9,598 was entered \nagainst Applicant. Additionally, Applicant had five charged-off accounts totaling more than \n$66,000 and six collection accounts totaling more than $9,600. The delinquent obligations \ntotaled more than $84,000. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d also apply. \n \nSecurity concerns having been raised, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sept. 22, 2005)). Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of explanation, \nextenuation, or mitigation to overcome the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n \n\n \n12 \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant showed poor financial judgment in her handling of her personal credit, \nas evidenced by her outstanding consumer-credit delinquencies including five charged-\noff accounts, six collection accounts, and a civil court judgment totaling more than \n$84,000, and by owing with her spouse more than $100,000 in unpaid Federal income \ntaxes.  \n \nApplicant failed to timely file her 2015 and 2016 Federal income tax returns in a \ntimely manner. The returns were finally filed in February and March 2018. A willful failure \nto timely make (means completed and filed with the IRS) a federal income tax return is a \nmisdemeanor-level federal criminal offense (Title 26 U.S.C, \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file \nreturn, supply information, or pay tax). The failure to timely file federal tax returns has \nsecurity implications because: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nThe Appeal Board ruled that \u201ceven in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016). \n \nApplicant has filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy three times: in October 2014, \nOctober 2017, and December 2018. The most recent bankruptcy plan was confirmed in \nJune 2019. Applicant's filing for bankruptcy does not preclude the administrative judge \nfrom making an adverse security clearance decision. The filing for bankruptcy protection \ndoes not preclude considerations of her overall history of financial problems, including \nevidence indicating that she had been less than diligent in addressing her longstanding \nfinancial problems. Moreover, security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but \nrather involve predictive judgments about a person's security eligibility based on \n\n \n13 \nconsideration of that person's past conduct and present circumstances. Department of \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  \n \nWhile a discharge in bankruptcy is intended to provide a person with a fresh start \nfinancially, it does not immunize an applicant's history of financial problems from being \nconsidered for its security significance. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 87-1800 (February \n14, 1989) at p. 3 n.2 (\"Although bankruptcy may be a legal and legitimate way for an \napplicant to handle his financial problems, the Examiner must consider the possible \nsecurity implications of the history of financial debts and problems that led to the filing of \nbankruptcy. Furthermore, a discharge in bankruptcy does not, in itself, prove that an \napplicant has changed the financial habits that led to the debts discharged in bankruptcy \nor that his past financial difficulties are not likely to recur.\"). Cf. Marshall v. District of \nColumbia Government, 559 F.2d 726, 729-30 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (discharge in bankruptcy \ndoes not preclude city from considering whether past financial problems disqualify person \nfor position as police officer). \n \nThere is no indication that any payments were made on any of the delinquent SOR \nobligations outside the bankruptcy proceedings. Five of the SOR delinquencies were \nlisted in her October 2014 bankruptcy filing and remained unpaid four years later when \nthose debts were included in her December 2018 bankruptcy filing. Applicant has \nacknowledged she was not involved with the family\u2019s finances. In their household, her \nhusband handled paying the bills. When she questioned her husband about their debts, \nhe said they were paid. She did not follow up and verify the debts were actually being \ntimely paid.  \n \nThe finances were not being properly handled. The tax returns were not being \ntimely made and income taxes were not timely paid. Applicant was unaware that their \nprevious home had gone to foreclosure. She stated she was unaware of that a 2014 \nChapter 13, Wage Earner\u2019s Plan, had been filed, even though it was a joint filing that \nwould require the signature of both parties. The power of attorney she gave her husband \nmight provide an explanation for the loss of the house, but it does not explain how a joint \nbankruptcy filing could be made with the knowledge of each party to the bankruptcy. \nRoutinely in bankruptcy proceedings the debtors must attend mandatory financial \ncounseling, which Applicant acknowledged occurred for the most recent bankruptcy. If \nshe had attended mandatory financial counseling for the 2014 filing, it would difficult to \nunderstand how she did not know the bankruptcy had been filed. \n \nThe number of delinquent obligations and her noncompliance with tax deadlines \nfor her 2015 and 2016 tax returns are too numerous and too recent for mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(a). The SOR alleges she failed to timely file her 2014 Federal tax return, \nhowever, the tax transcripts presented indicated the 2014 return was filed in March 2015, \nwhich was a timely filing.  \n \nFor the mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, the individual must establish that \nthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol and the individual must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. In 2013, \n\n \n14 \nApplicant chose to take time off from her job with a defense contractor to take care of her \nthree children. This is not an event or condition largely beyond her control. However, her \nspouse was laid off his job with a defense contractor shortly after Applicant had resigned \nfrom her job, which was a factor beyond her control. There was a reduction in household \nincome, but the tax transcripts indicate the lowest the household adjusted gross income \n(AGI), while Applicant was not working outside the home, was $129,190. The AGI for the \nyears in questions were: 2013, ($312,737), 2014 ($129,190), 2015 ($134,703), 2016 \n($322,715), and 2017 (no tax transcript). Her post-hearing assertion that she might have \nbeen the victim of identity theft regarding her taxes is too speculative to provide mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(b). The medical treatment for her son, which totaled $3,704, is not \nsufficiently large enough to explain her financial problems. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s favor, she has filed her delinquent income tax returns for tax years \n2015 and 2016, but a tax bill of more than $100,000 remains. Even where delinquent tax \nreturns have now been filed and an applicant is motivated to prevent such problems in \nthe future, the administrative judge is not precluded from considering an applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness in light of longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board has long held \nthat the failure to file tax returns suggests a problem with complying with well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, \n2016.) Failing to timely file tax returns shows poor judgment. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply \nbecause while Applicant and her spouse have a payment arrangement with the \nbankruptcy court under which $950 monthly payments are being made to the IRS, the \nrecord indicates the tax is still being disputed by Applicant and her spouse. They have \nnot established a sufficient track record of payments, either through the bankruptcy court \nor to the IRS directly to fully mitigate their substantial tax delinquency. \n \n \nApplicant has attended court-ordered mandatory financial counseling as part of \nher bankruptcy filing. However, it is too soon to say there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Although \nApplicant has challenged the exact amount of the income tax debt, AG \u00b6 20(e) does not \napply because the record contains no documented proof to substantiate the basis of the \ndispute or provide evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \nIt would be premature to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s consumer delinquencies. Although a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing is \na legal means to address debts, and the plan has been recently confirmed, only six \nmonths of payments on a 60-month plan have been made. It is acknowledged the amount \nalready paid is sizable, having paid more than $86,000. However, the total payment on \nthe plan is more than $719,000, which is even more sizable. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n\n \n15 \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse \ninformation about an applicant before making a security clearance decision. The \ngovernment relies on applicants to truthfully disclose adverse information in a timely \nfashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s \nwillingness to report adverse information about herself provides some indication of her \nwillingness to report inadvertent violations or other concerns in the future, something the \ngovernment relies on to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. The record evidence \nas a whole must be considered to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of \nthe omission. An applicant\u2019s level of education and business experience are relevant to \ndetermining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate.  \n  \n\n \n16 \nOn Applicant\u2019s February 2018 e-QIP, she answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if she had \nfailed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance. \nApplicant signed her and her spouse\u2019s joint tax returns, so she knew their 2015 and 2016 \nFederal tax returns were not timely filed and that she owed Federal income taxes for tax \nyears 2013, 2014, and 2016. Additionally, through her involvement in the October 2017 \nbankruptcy proceedings, she knew the IRS was demanding a sizable amount of \ndelinquent taxes, more than $100,000. On the same e-QIP, Applicant she answered \u201cno\u201d \nwhen asked whether there had been any judgment entered against her, when a judgment \nhad in fact been entered against her three months earlier in November 2017. AG \u00b6 15(b), \nand AG \u00b6 16(a) apply. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors apply. AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, \ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts,\u201d does not apply. The omissions or concealments were not \ncaused by legal advice or by advice from a government representative or other person \ninvolved in making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, so AG \u00b6 17(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) provides: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nFalsifying a security questionnaire is not minor, it occurred less than a year and a \nhalf ago, it did not happen under unique circumstances, and it does cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The security concern has not \nbeen mitigated by the passage of time. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply The mitigating \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d), 17(e), 17(f), and 17 (g) also do not apply. Regarding AG \u00b6 \n17(d), Applicant claims that she did not list any debts on her SF 86 because she believed \nthey had been paid. The objective evidence clearly indicates otherwise. She and her \nspouse had filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy as recently as October 2017, in part to \naddress their sizeable tax debts. Applicant did not provide a reasonable explanation for \nhow $225,091 in debts would have been resolved in six months. AG \u00b6 17(d) is not \nsatisfied because she has yet to acknowledge her deliberate false statements.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) provides: \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \n \n \nApplicant claims that she did not list any debts on her SF 86 because she believed \nthey had been paid. The objective evidence clearly indicates otherwise. She and her \n\n \n17 \nspouse had filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy as recently as October 2017, in part to \naddress their sizeable tax debts. Applicant did not provide a reasonable explanation for \nhow $225,091 in debts would have been resolved in six months. AG \u00b6 17(d) is not \nsatisfied because she has yet to acknowledge her deliberate false statements. The \nremaining mitigating conditions (AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(e), 17(f), and 17(g) also do not apply.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guidelines E and F are incorporated in the \nwhole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant is a 44-year-\nold engineer who has been employed by a defense contractor since January 2018. \nApplicant and her spouse have had to resort to Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection three \ntimes since 2014. Their current Chapter 13 repayment plan has been recently confirmed \nand they have made payments of more than $86,000 in accord with the plan. Six months \nof payments have been made on the 60-month repayment plan. The plan requires total \npayments of more than $700,000. Their two delinquent tax returns for tax years 2015 and \n2016 were filed in 2018. The IRS is owed more than $100,000. \n \nApplicant claims that she was uninvolved in her family\u2019s financial decisions to the \npoint she was unaware their house had gone to foreclosure, that she filed a joint \nbankruptcy petition in 2014, and that a civil court judgment was entered against her in \nNovember 2017. She also denies knowing about the charged-off and collection accounts \ntotaling more than $84,000. She now asserts she has her own checking account and \nactively reviews the household\u2019s finances making sure all the debts are timely paid. Her \n\n \n18 \ninvolvement in monitoring the household\u2019s finances is a recent positive development, but \nit does not mitigate the judgment concerns raised by her lack of candor about her tax \nissues.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. Applicant \ndid not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nIn reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and \nthat analysis does not support a favorable decision, even though, as previously stated, \nshe has made sizable payment in accord with the repayment plan. Additionally, her \nevaluations showing her job assessments, her key strengths, and performance ratings \nstate she is highly effective at her job. Her employer has such faith in her duty \nperformance that she has recently been promoted to section manager with direct \nsupervisor of 12 to 15 engineers. However, her favorable job performance is not enough \nto overcome the issues of security concern. \n \nThe decision to deny her a clearance at this time should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of true reform and \nrehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance in the future. The \nawarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on \napplying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under \nApplicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not recommended, but should Applicant \nbe afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future she may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness. Favorable consideration \nwould be given to additional months of compliance with the Chapter 13 repayment plan. \nHowever, a clearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \n \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid\u2014it is \nwhether her financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations and personal \nconduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant, except for tax year \n2014.  \n\n \n19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e - s: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 23, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant responded to the SOR on November 14, 2018, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 28, \n2019.  \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non April 12, 2019, scheduling the hearing for May 10, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which \nwere admitted without objection.  \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2015. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has \nheld with some breaks for many years. He attended community college for a period in \nthe 1980s, but he did not earn a degree. He is married without children.1 \n \n \nApplicant lived overseas for a number of years before 2000 and did not have to \nfile state income tax returns. He always prepared his own federal income tax returns. \nHe moved to his current state in about 2000. He found the state returns to be more \ndifficult to prepare than his federal returns. He admitted that he is not good with \nnumbers, and he was too embarrassed to ask for help. He also thought that he had \nenough withheld from his pay that he would not owe the state any additional taxes. He \nfiled all his federal returns as required, but he did not file his state income tax returns \nwhen they were due for tax years 2001 through 2014.2 \n \n \nApplicant reported his failure to file his state income tax returns on his May 2016 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), and he discussed the matter \nduring his background interview in October 2017. He hired H&R Block; and he filed his \n2001, 2006, and 2012 through 2014 state income tax returns in 2016. He filed his 2015 \nthrough 2018 state income tax returns in October 2016, July 2017, March 2018, and \nMarch 2019. His remaining state returns were filed in 2018 and 2019. His state imposed \n$50 penalties for not filing the older returns, even when there were no taxes due. All of \nhis state income taxes are paid, including $730 in penalties and $576 in interest.3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not truly appreciate the significance of his failing to \nfile his state returns. He does now. He plans to continue using H&R Block to prepare his \nreturns. He credibly testified that he will file all future state and federal income tax \nreturns and pay any taxes owed when they are due. There are no other issues about his \nfinances.4 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 26, 28, 36; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-22, 26-27, 30-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n3 Tr. at 22-26, 30-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n4 Tr. at 25-27, 37; AE B-D. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant did not file his 2001 through 2014 state income tax returns when they \nwere due. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he is not good with numbers. He filed all his federal \nreturns as required, but he found the state returns to be beyond his capabilities, and he \nwas too embarrassed to ask for help. He also thought that he had enough withheld from \n\n \n5 \n \nhis pay that he would not owe the state any additional taxes. His failure to file his tax \nreturns when required raises some questions about his judgment and willingness to \nabide by rules and regulations.  \n \n \nI found Applicant to be honest and truthful, but unsophisticated in regard to his \nfinances and other matters. He reported his failure to file his state income tax returns on \nhis May 2016 SF 86, and he discussed his taxes during his background interview in \nOctober 2017. He hired H&R Block; and he started to file the returns in 2016, more than \ntwo years before the SOR was issued. All of his state tax returns have been filed, and \nall of his taxes paid. Applicant knows it is his legal obligation to file his tax returns and \npay his taxes, and that failure to do so in the future could cost him his security clearance \nand his job. He credibly stated that he will file all future returns when they are due. I am \nsatisfied that Applicant\u2019s finances are now in order and that his tax issues will not be \nrepeated. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) are partially applicable. \nSecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 34 years old. He is married and has no children. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since May 2010. He first worked for a federal contractor in 2008, which is when he obtained a security clearance. He has a master\u2019s degree. (Tr. at18, 20, 26-27; GE 1) The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from March 2005 to July 2017; that he used marijuana while holding a security clearance; and that in April 2018, when he completed his security clearance application (SCA), he stated he intended to use marijuana in the future. Applicant admitted using marijuana a few times in 2005. He discontinued using marijuana because he did not find it interesting and he was concerned such use would hamper his ability to obtain a job. He was granted a security clearance in 2008 after filling out an security clearance application (SCA), which asked him about recent drug use. He resumed using marijuana in approximately December 2017, in an attempt to relieve his headaches and as a way to relax.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 22, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nOn November 16, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and originally requested \nan administrative determination. Applicant hired counsel and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on April 4, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n\n \n2 \n \n \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April 25, 2019, and the hearing was held on May \n22, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-4, which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. \nApplicant testified and offered exhibits (Tab) A through E, which were admitted into \nevidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a hearing brief, which was \nmarked as HE II and an exhibit list, which was marked as HE III. The record remained \nopen and Applicant timely submitted Applicant exhibit (AE) F, which was admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 5, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. He is married and has no children. He has worked for \nhis current employer, a defense contractor, since May 2010. He first worked for a \nfederal contractor in 2008, which is when he obtained a security clearance. He has a \nmaster\u2019s degree. (Tr. at18, 20, 26-27; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from March \n2005 to July 2017; that he used marijuana while holding a security clearance; and that \nin April 2018, when he completed his security clearance application (SCA), he stated he \nintended to use marijuana in the future. \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted using marijuana a few times in 2005. He discontinued using \nmarijuana because he did not find it interesting and he was concerned such use would \nhamper his ability to obtain a job. He was granted a security clearance in 2008 after \nfilling out an security clearance application (SCA), which asked him about recent drug \nuse. He resumed using marijuana in approximately December 2017, in an attempt to \nrelieve his headaches and as a way to relax. He held a security clearance at the time \nand knew use of marijuana was against federal law and the law of his state of \nresidence. He continued to use marijuana approximately 20 times through June 2018. \nHe filled out another SCA in April 2018, admitting his use of marijuana and stating that \nhe intended to continue to use marijuana in the future. He continued to use marijuana \nuntil June 2018. He was interviewed by a defense investigator in July 2018. He told the \ninvestigator that he did not intend to continue using marijuana because he no longer \nfound it interesting and it was \u201chit or miss\u201d with providing headache relief. Upon cross \nexamination at hearing, he admitted that one reason he changed his view of future \nmarijuana use was because he discovered the impact such use had on his security \nclearance and possibly his job. (Tr. at 29-30, 32, 34-36; GE 1-4) \n \n \nWhen Applicant was using marijuana he used it with his wife, his sister, and \nsome friends. He used by smoking the marijuana. He claims that both his sister and his \nwife have stopped using marijuana (wife provided a negative drug test from March \n2019), and that his friends either no longer use marijuana or they do not use in his \n\n \n3 \n \n \npresence. He sought treatment for substance-induced anxiety disorder in July 2018 and \nsuccessfully completed counseling later that month. Other than a letter describing his \nsuccessful completion of counseling, no specific treatment plan, or prognosis, was set \nout. In May 2019, he signed a written statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture. He also provided two drugs tests from March 2019 and May 2019 showing that \nhe tested negative for marijuana on both occasions. Applicant indicated that he now \nuses meditation as a substitute for marijuana to deal with his anxiety. (Tr. at 38, 41-43; \nTab C, E; AE F) \n \n \nApplicant presented seven declarations from friends and a former coworker. \nThey described Applicant as truthful, trustworthy, responsible, and possessing good \njudgment. They all believe he will not use illegal drugs in the future. His 2018 job \nperformance appraisal gave him an overall evaluation of \u201csubstantial impact,\u201d which was \nthe highest rating for his employee category. (Tabs C-D) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n4 \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \n \nAG 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \n \n \nAG 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;   \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and   \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on a few occasions in 2005, stopped using for about 12 \nyears, then resumed his use between December 2017 and June 2018 on approximately \n20 occasions. He has held a security clearance since 2008. In his 2018 SCA, he stated \nhis intent was to continue using marijuana. I find all the above disqualifying conditions \napply.  \n \n \nAG 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \n \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \n \neligibility; and  \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use and of marijuana was frequent and as recent as June 2018, while \nholding a security clearance and after he recently completed an updated SCA. Given \nhis recent pattern of use, his claimed abstinence beginning in June 2018 is not \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsufficiently attenuated to be considered remote. Although he provided a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all future illegal drug use, as recently as April 2018 \nhe indicated his intent was to continue his use of marijuana despite knowing it was \nunlawful to do so. He claims his wife, sister and friends that he associates with no \nlonger use marijuana. Applicant\u2019s claimed abstention is insufficient to convince me that \nrecurrence is unlikely. The frequency and recency of his past use and his recent \nstatement of intent to continue his use casts doubt upon his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG 26(a) does not apply and AG 26(b) has some \napplication.  \n \n \nAlthough he received counseling for substance-induced anxiety disorder in July \n2018, that evidence does not contain a prognosis by a qualified medical professional. \nAG 26(d) has some application. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.         \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant \nvoluntarily disclosed his marijuana history, his character references, his work \nperformance, his drug counseling, his recent negative drug-test results, and his stated \nintention of no future use. However, I also considered that he used marijuana on \nnumerous occasions while holding a security clearance and that as recently as April \n2018, he expressed his intent to continue using marijuana. It was only after he realized \nthat using marijuana jeopardized his security clearance that he had a change of heart \nconcerning his future intentions.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs     1.a - 1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

In a detailed response to the SOR allegations, which was included in AE B, Applicant admitted that his spouse\u2019s relatives are resident citizens of China, but he indicated that his and his spouse\u2019s contacts with her family in China are so casual, infrequent, and minimal that they do not create a risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, persuasion, or coercion. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 32-year-old technical staff member at a federally-funded research and development laboratory. (GE 1; AE B.)

Applicant \ndoes not have close relations with his spouse\u2019s foreign family members. A lifelong resident \ncitizen of the United States, he has shown that he can handle classified information \nappropriately. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \nApplicant filed a detailed pro se response to the SOR allegations on December 21, \n2018. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). On April 9, 2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct \na hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. On April 15, 2019, I scheduled a hearing \nfor May 8, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing, two Government exhibits (GEs 1-2) were admitted. Three hearing \nexhibits (HEs) were marked for the record but not admitted: a January 25, 2019 letter \nforwarding copies of the proposed GEs to Applicant and the Government\u2019s Request for \nAdministrative Notice\u2013People\u2019s Republic of China as HE I; a list of the GEs as HE II; and \nthe Request for Administrative Notice with extracts of the source documents as HE III. \nTwenty-five Applicant exhibits (AEs A-Y) were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant and three witnesses testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June \n4, 2019. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government submitted for administrative notice several facts \npertinent to China, as set forth in a Request for Administrative Notice\u2013People\u2019s Republic \nof China, dated January 25, 2019. The Government\u2019s request was based on excerpts of \nU.S. government publications, including the DOD\u2019s reports to Congress on military and \nsecurity developments involving China for 2012, 2013, and 2018; a report of the Office of \nNational Counterintelligence Executive, Report to Congress on Foreign Economic \nCollection and Industrial Espionage, 2009-2011; February 9, 2016 remarks by the \nDirector of National Intelligence to the Senate Armed Services Committee; a 2016 report \nto Congress by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission; the U.S. \nState Department\u2019s 2017 human rights report for China; the State Department\u2019s travel \ninformation for China dated January 3, 2019; and two summaries and six press releases \nfrom the U.S. Department of Justice reporting recent economic espionage activity \ntargeting the United States and U.S. commercial entities. \n \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political \nconditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties of my intention to take administrative notice, subject \nto the reliability of the source documentation and the relevance and materiality of the facts \nproposed. Applicant confirmed through his counsel his receipt of the Request for \nAdministrative Notice with extracts of the source documents. Applicant filed no objections \nto the facts set forth in the Government\u2019s Administrative Notice request. He declined an \nopportunity to propose additional facts for administrative notice. \n \n \nConcerning the reports and press releases of criminal activity and export violations \non China\u2019s behalf, they were presented by the Government apparently to substantiate \nthat China engages in espionage against the United States and actively pursues \ncollection of U.S. economic and proprietary information. Neither Applicant nor his \n\n \n \n3 \nspouse\u2019s family members in China were implicated in that criminal activity. With that \ncaveat, the facts administratively noticed are set forth below. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s parents-in law (SOR \u00b6 1.a), \nbrother-in-law and his spouse (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and spouse\u2019s grandmother (SOR \u00b6 1.c) are \nresident citizens of China. In a detailed response to the SOR allegations, which was \nincluded in AE B, Applicant admitted that his spouse\u2019s relatives are resident citizens of \nChina, but he indicated that his and his spouse\u2019s contacts with her family in China are so \ncasual, infrequent, and minimal that they do not create a risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, persuasion, or coercion. After considering the pleadings, \nexhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old technical staff member at a federally-funded research \nand development laboratory. (GE 1; AE B.) He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace \nengineering awarded in June 2009, and a master\u2019s degree in engineering and \nmanagement awarded in June 2014 from the same university. (GE 1; AEs A-C, N-O; Tr. \n29-30.) Applicant previously worked for his current employer from July 2009 to August \n2013 (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 28-29, 92), and he was granted a Secret clearance in October \n2009. His clearance was upgraded to Top Secret in March 2010. He ended his \nemployment because the university could not give him a scholarship while he was \nworking for the laboratory, and his clearance eligibility lapsed. After he returned to work \nfor the laboratory full time in April 2015, his security clearance eligibility was renewed at \nthe Secret level. He was granted an interim Top Secret clearance in June 2016. He \ncurrently holds a Secret clearance. (GE 1; AEs A-B, R; Tr. 32-33, 93.) \n \nA lifelong resident citizen of the United States (GE 1; AEs A-D), Applicant was \nraised with his only sibling in a small town by his U.S. native-citizen mother, who moved \nback home after her divorce when Applicant was four years old. His maternal \ngrandparents, both U.S. native citizens, helped raised Applicant and his sister, and they \nremained an important part of his life, even after his mother remarried. He lived with his \nmother, stepfather, and sister during his youth, before his mother and stepfather divorced. \nApplicant was raised with strong American values. He celebrated holidays with his family, \nplayed hockey throughout his youth, and was a Boy Scout. After excelling in high school, \nhe received a scholarship from a prestigious university in the United States. He was active \nin his fraternity in college, and he is still active in fundraising for capital improvements for \nthe local chapter of his fraternity. (GE 1; AEs A-D, N-Q; Tr. 19-26.) \n \nApplicant met his spouse in October 2013 at a housewarming party of a mutual \nacquaintance. He was in graduate school and did not have a security clearance at that \ntime. (Tr. 38.) A native of China with Chinese citizenship, his spouse was raised in China \nwith her twin brother. She graduated from a Chinese university in June 2007, having spent \nthe previous summer as an exchange student in the United States. In August 2007, she \ncame to the United States on an F-1 student visa to pursue a doctorate degree in \ncomputational biology. While a graduate student, she traveled to China twice in 2008 to \n\n \n \n4 \nvisit her parents and grandparents. She traveled to China to renew her visa in April 2010. \nAlthough her parents disapproved, she elected to stay in the United States after she \nearned her doctorate degree in May 2012 because of the high scientific standards in the \nUnited States and for the career opportunities in her field. She began working, initially \nunder her student visa, which was extended for training purposes. In 2013, she obtained \nan H-1B visa under the sponsorship of her employer. (AEs B, X; Tr. 36-39, 94-95.) She \nhas been consistently employed by the same parent company in the United States, \nworking for different units after some corporate reorganizations. (GE 2; AE X; Tr. 41-42.) \nHer current salary is $120,000 a year. (Tr. 95.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse began dating in late 2013. Applicant had left the \nemployment of the federally-funded research laboratory and had started his own business \nin the energy sector. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 30.) In December 2013, Applicant\u2019s spouse traveled \nto China to renew her H-1B visa. She visited her mother, father, and brother during her \n19-day stay, and shared a photo of Applicant with them. In June 2014, Applicant and his \nspouse began cohabiting. (GE 1; AEs A-B, X; Tr. 40.) Applicant made an effort to have \nhis spouse involved in gatherings of his family, who welcomed her. (AEs Q, Y.) He took \nher to meet his family for the first time in 2014, and over time his spouse developed close \nrelationships with his mother and sister. (AE X.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse traveled to China in September 2014 to give a presentation for \nher U.S.\u2013based employer at an international conference. She visited her parents and \nbrother during that trip and told her parents that she and Applicant were in a stable \nrelationship. Applicant returned to work for the laboratory in April 2015. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. \n31.) In September 2015, he and his spouse traveled to China for him to meet her parents, \nfor tourism, and for her to renew her H-1B visa. (AEs B, X; Tr. 69.) He informed his \nemployer about his trip ahead of time. (Tr. 69.) During his three-week stay in China, \nApplicant and his spouse visited her parents, her grandparents, and her brother and his \nfianc\u00e9e. Applicant had limited communication with them because of the language barrier. \nHe had to rely on his spouse to translate. (Tr. 49.) When Applicant\u2019s in-laws asked his \nspouse about Applicant\u2019s occupation, she told them that he founded a start-up energy \ncompany. He was still pursuing the business venture while working for his defense \ncontractor employer, but she did not inform her parents of his employment in the U.S. \ndefense industry. Applicant\u2019s spouse traveled to China without him for her brother\u2019s \nwedding in December 2015. During her stay, her parents inquired about her relationship \nwith Applicant but not about his employment. (AEs B, X.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse became engaged in May 2016. (Tr. 40, 96.) A few days \nlater, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) for a clearance upgrade. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 79.) He reported his \ncohabitation since June 2014 with his spouse and indicated that she was born in China. \nIn response to an inquiry concerning whether he or an immediate family member had any \nforeign government contacts in the last seven years, Applicant reported that his \ncohabitant had contact with the Chinese Consulate in December 2010 to renew her \nChinese passport. In response to a question concerning foreign travel in the last seven \nyears, Applicant disclosed his trip to China from September 2015 to October 2015 for \n\n \n \n5 \ntourism purposes. He answered negatively to inquiries concerning whether he had any \ncontacts or issues outside of routine border contacts. (GE 1; AE B.) \n \nApplicant closed his start-up business in September 2016 due to a lack of funding \nand customers. (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 30.) Applicant and his spouse traveled to China in April \n2017 so that she could renew her H-1B visa. Applicant stayed in China for one week, and \nhe and his spouse visited her grandparents. (Tr. 70, 116.) Applicant\u2019s spouse stayed in \nChina for a few weeks after Applicant returned to the United States because her \ngrandfather was near death. (AE B.) \n \nIn July 2017, Applicant and his spouse married in the United States. Several of \nApplicant\u2019s family members, including his mother, sister, maternal grandparents, and \nmaternal uncles attended the wedding. (AEs B, N-P.) His spouse\u2019s parents, brother, and \nbrother\u2019s wife came from China for the wedding (AE B, Tr. 115), even though they \ndisapproved of the marriage. (AEs E, J, N-P, Tr. 50, 52.) His spouse\u2019s family stayed in a \nhotel. (Tr. 52, 107, 115.) Applicant explained that they made the decision to attend only \na week before the wedding after his spouse convinced them it was the right thing to do. \n(Tr. 115.) \n \nApplicant updated his SF-86 to reflect that his cohabitant was now his spouse. (AE \nB.) In August 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM). He disclosed that he had in-person contact with his \nparents-in-law in September 2015 and July 2017. He did not know their occupations and \ndenied that they had any association with a foreign government, including its security or \nintelligence services, or its defense industry. When asked about developed foreign \ncontacts, Applicant related that he had quarterly contact with his spouse\u2019s brother, a self-\nemployed web designer in China, and with her brother\u2019s wife, a translator in China. \nApplicant indicated that he had annual contact with his spouse\u2019s grandmother. Applicant \ndenied that he could be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of \na foreign individual or government and the United States, and stated that if a conflict \narose, he would resolve the matter in the U.S. interests. He asserted he would abide by \nreporting requirements and added that these foreign contacts do not know that he is \nundergoing consideration for a national security position. (GE 2; AE B.) \n \nApplicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator on August 22, 2017, for \ndetails about the occupations of his spouse\u2019s parents and grandparents. He related that \nhis parents-in-law are professors at the same university in China. His spouse\u2019s \ngrandmother and grandfather had worked for a telecommunications school, as a teacher \nand engineer, respectively. (GE 2; AE B.) His spouse\u2019s grandmother retired \napproximately 20 years ago. (AE B; Tr. 117.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse traveled to China for five days in September 2017 after \nspending their honeymoon elsewhere in Asia. They had an informal celebration of their \nmarriage for his spouse\u2019s family and friends who were unable to attend their wedding in \nthe United States as a sign of respect for her family. (Tr. 70, 115.) Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s \nfamily, including her grandmother and some extended family members, and some of her \n\n \n \n6 \ncollege friends attended the informal celebration. (Tr. 125-126.) To Applicant\u2019s \nknowledge, his employment was not discussed during that trip. (AEs B, X.) As with his \nprevious trips to China, he reported his travel to his employer. (Tr. 69.) \n  \nApplicant\u2019s spouse, who is age 34, received her U.S. permanent residence status \nin July 2018. She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when she becomes eligible in 2021 \n(Tr. 95-96), and she does not intend to travel to China in the future unless her parents or \nbrother becomes gravely ill or dies. His spouse is bilingual, but she now considers English \nher primary language. She has not voted in a Chinese election since a 2002 local election, \nand she does not intend to vote in a Chinese election in the future. Applicant\u2019s spouse \nhas adopted America as her home and become assimilated into American ways of life. \nShe celebrates American holidays, enjoys and plays U.S. sports, and participates in \nmonthly meetings of her condominium association. She has close friendships with U.S. \ncitizens, and has a 401(k) account in the United States valued at $120,000. She co-owns \nother assets with Applicant, including their residence, which they purchased in August \n2017 (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 42-43), and a brokerage account valued at $64,000. They have \nsavings and checking account assets of approximately $75,000. (AE X.)Their total net \nworth is about $750,000. (Tr. 46.) Applicant\u2019s spouse has a dormant bank account in \nChina with $100 on deposit. She cannot access the account online. Her mother can \naccess the account. Applicant\u2019s spouse plans to close the account should she go to \nChina. She has no investment assets in China and owns no property in China. (AE X.) \n \n \nOn October 31, 2018, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories about his \nforeign contacts. Applicant reported that his spouse had acquired her U.S. permanent \nresidence card. He listed his parents-in-law\u2019s employments as professors at a university \nin China, but denied that they were affiliated with a foreign government or military. He \ndescribed the frequency of his contacts with them as quarterly, with his most recent \ncontacts occurring in April 2018 with his father-in-law and in June 2018 with his mother-\nin-law. He indicated that his spouse has weekly contact with her parents. Concerning \ncontacts with his spouse\u2019s brother, Applicant described the frequency of his contact as \nquarterly to as recently as September 2018, and his spouse\u2019s contact as weekly. As for \nhis brother-in-law\u2019s wife, Applicant indicated that he did not know her current employment \nbecause she had recently changed jobs. It had been since May 2018 that he had any \ncontact with her, but his spouse had monthly contact with her sister-in-law. Applicant \nreported that his spouse\u2019s grandfather had died in May 2017. He denied any contact with \nhis spouse\u2019s grandmother beyond the in-person contacts in China. His spouse had \ncontact with her on a weekly basis. (GE 2.) \n \n \nOn November 20, 2018, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because his \nspouse\u2019s family members (parents, brother and brother\u2019s wife, and grandmother) are \nresident citizens of China. Applicant decided at that time to cease any communications \nwith his spouse\u2019s family in China. He did not want to jeopardize his security clearance \nand career. (Tr. 50.) \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR dated December 21, 2018, Applicant detailed his \nspouse\u2019s increased ties to the United States since her arrival as a doctoral student in \n\n \n \n7 \nAugust 2007. He explained that his spouse had planned in 2007 to return home to China \nevery six months because she thought she would have difficulty adjusting to life in the \nUnited States, but that changed after two years. Since obtaining her \u201cgreen card,\u201d his \nspouse no longer needs to travel to China to renew her visa to stay in the United States, \nand she has no intention to return to China. He added that because she has adopted \nAmerican ways and culture, she finds it more difficult to relate to her friends and family in \nChina, which has led to decreased frequency of her communications with them over the \nyears. Applicant described his relationship with his parents-in-law as \u201cstrained\u201d and his \ninteractions with them as \u201cthe minimum necessary to be polite,\u201d elaborating as follows: \n \nUpon hearing of my proposal to [spouse\u2019s name omitted], they told her they \nwould not approve of the marriage and I would not be accepted into the \nfamily because of the cultural differences between Americans and Chinese. \nThey continue to disapprove of me since I do not have a doctoral degree \nand I have no intention of pursuing additional education to change their \nopinion. They don\u2019t care to learn anything about me and I have no desire to \nlearn about or interact with them. When we are in the room together, there \nare long periods of silence as my mother- and father-in-law do not speak to \nme and I do not speak to them. Because of my detached relationship with \nmy mother- and father-in-law, it is extremely unlikely that I will be placed in \na position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States. \n(AE B.) \n \n \nApplicant sees no reason to engage with his spouse\u2019s family members in the \nfuture. He does not intend to travel to China in the future. (Tr. 52.) He testified that his \nmother-in-law \u201cdefinitely has a dislike of [him].\u201d (Tr. 54.) Their relationship has been \nparticularly contentious because he is \u201ca person of some color and American. Not \nChinese.\u201d (Tr. 57.) Applicant wants nothing to do with his spouse\u2019s family in the future. \n(Tr. 68.) He indicated that he would absolutely keep them from coming to the United \nStates if he could. (Tr. 67.) On the limited occasions where he had sent them a text \nmessage for their birthdays and major holidays, they responded politely in Chinese. They \nknow little English and he knows little Chinese. They have not initiated any contact with \nhim, and he has had no email or telephone correspondence with his parents-in-law. (AE \nB.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse does not have any ongoing contact by telephone or email with \nher family in China. As of December 2018, she was communicating with them by text \nmessaging every two weeks, to exchange greetings or comment about photos posted. \nApplicant indicated that, in the past, his spouse had given her parents $1,000 each time \nthat she traveled to China to cover the expenses of her trips, but neither he nor his spouse \nplan on giving any money to her parents in the future. Applicant\u2019s spouse was given \n$4,500 from her parents as a wedding gift, but she had not received any other money \nfrom her parents in recent years. (AE B; Tr. 45-48.) \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \nApplicant understands from his spouse that her mother and father currently work \npart-time as auditors at a private college which has a partnership agreement with a state \nuniversity in China. They officially retired from their academic careers at the college as \nprofessors of mathematics and engineering in 2010 and 2014, respectively. The college \nhas its own funding. (Tr. 97-98.) His parents-in-law are members of the Chinese \nCommunist Party (CCP). His mother-in-law is currently serving a two-year term from 2017 \nto 2019 as the CCP\u2019s representative to the college on retirement issues. She is \nresponsible for organizing meetings of university teachers and professors to discuss \nretirement rulings and decisions from the central government. (AE B; Tr. 98-100.) His \nspouse learned about her mother\u2019s CCP position in the summer of 2018. (AE B; Tr. 102.) \nHis parents-in-law\u2019s CCP affiliation was another motivation for Applicant to cease all \ncommunications with them. (AE B.) \n \n \nApplicant does not believe that his spouse\u2019s family members know about his \ndefense-contractor employment. Applicant\u2019s contact with his spouse\u2019s parents has been \nlimited to his in-person contacts during his trips to China in September 2015 and \nSeptember 2017 and his wedding in the United States in July 2017, and to a few text \nmessages. When Applicant informed his brother-in-law about his engagement to his \nspouse, his brother-in-law told him the relationship would not work out. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his brother-in-law has been distant and strained since then. (AE B; Tr. \n58-59.) Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s contact with her brother had decreased by December 2018 \nto once every two weeks. She gave her brother $1,000 for his wedding in 2015 and $1,000 \nin 2017 on the birth of his son. Neither Applicant nor his spouse intend to give any money \nto her brother in the future. Applicant and his spouse have very limited contact with his \nspouse\u2019s brother\u2019s wife, and they are not aware of their sister-in-law\u2019s current \nemployment, if any. She previously worked at a shipping logistics company. (AE B; Tr. \n60.) To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, neither his spouse\u2019s brother nor brother\u2019s wife is affiliated \nwith the Chinese government or military. (Tr. 112.) \n \n \nApplicant has been the subject of racist comments from his spouse\u2019s grandmother, \nwho continues to disapprove of him. (Tr. 118.) Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s grandmother has no \ndesire or interest to interact with him and the feeling is mutual. He has only interacted \nwith her during his trips to China. He has otherwise had no communication with her. In \nDecember 2018, Applicant estimated the frequency of his spouse\u2019s contacts with her \ngrandmother to be every two weeks. His spouse received $1,000 from her grandmother \nas a wedding gift. (AE B; Tr. 63.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse provided an affidavit dated May 4, 2019, in which she described \nher connections to the United States, including employment, financial, friendships, familial \nthrough her marriage, legal immigration, activities, and interests. Should she and \nApplicant have children, they plan to raise them in the United States \u201clearning American \nculture and practicing American values.\u201d Regarding her family members in China, \nApplicant\u2019s spouse asserts that she does not have close relations with them. Her \ncorrespondence with her grandmother consists of one text message a month \u201cto politely \nrequire about her health.\u201d She indicated that her mother has shown little interest in her \nlife throughout her life, and their relationship has become only more distant since she \n\n \n \n9 \nmoved to the United States. She texts her mother once a month to wish her well. About \nher mother\u2019s position as the CCP representative on retirement matters, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse described it as \u201cthe lowest level position one can hold in the Communist Party.\u201d \nHer communication with her father consists of text messaging once a month on \u201clogistical \ntopics\u201d and nothing personal. She considers her relationship to her brother to be \nsuperficial and with her brother\u2019s wife to be distant but polite. She communicates with her \nbrother by text messaging once a month and with her sister-in-law three or four times a \nyear. Applicant\u2019s spouse indicates that Applicant has \u201ccut off all communications\u201d with her \nfamily members in China. Applicant\u2019s spouse expressed no intention of traveling to China \nunless her parents or brother becomes gravely ill or pass away. She indicated that should \nshe and Applicant have children, her parents and brother and his wife might travel to the \nUnited States once every couple of years while the children are young. (AE X.) Applicant\u2019s \nspouse reduced the frequency of her contacts with her family in China after Applicant \ninformed her that her communications with them was putting his job and career at risk, \nand because of the way her family has treated him. (Tr. 105, 119.) Applicant testified that \nsince their marriage, her family has \u201creally pushed [his spouse] away.\u201d (Tr. 105, 110.) \n \n  \nApplicant credibly professes sole allegiance to the United States. He has voted in \nevery national election and most local elections since he became eligible to vote at age \n18. (AEs B, V.) He registered for the U.S. Selective Service in August 2004. (AEs B, W.)  \nHe is on the finance committee for his homeowner\u2019s association. When he is not traveling \nfor work, he plays in an adult sports league. He has served as alumni president for the \nlocal chapter of his fraternity for the past three years. His family members were all born \nin the United States with the exception of his paternal grandmother, who was raised in \nthe United States and is a U.S. citizen. Applicant is not close to his paternal grandmother \nbecause of his parents\u2019 divorce. (AE B.) His financial assets are all in the United States. \n(Tr. 46.) His current salary at his defense-contractor employment is $138,000 annually. \n(Tr. 93.) He understands that he could be targeted for classified information. If anything \nchanges in terms of communication from his spouse\u2019s family, he would immediately report \nthem. (Tr. 73.) He would not hesitate to report any improper contact to his security \ndepartment, including if it came from his spouse. (Tr. 75.) \n \nEmployment and Character References \n \n \nApplicant accesses classified information for his duties with his current employer \non a bi-weekly basis. He is required to maintain a minimum of a Secret clearance for his \nemployment. (AE B; Tr. 32.) He has stayed up-to-date on his security trainings and takes \nhis security responsibilities seriously. (AEs S-T; Tr. 72.) He considers it \u201cthe highest honor \nto be able to hold a security clearance.\u201d He has earned a reputation at work for performing \nat a level higher than expected. (AE U.) The chief security officer at the laboratory attests \nthat Applicant has not had any security-related incidents on the job. Applicant was \n\u201cpurposeful and timely\u201d in reporting all required updates to his personal background, such \nas his marriage to a Chinese national and her foreign relatives. He has been briefed about \nforeign intelligence recruitment and counterintelligence awareness topics and about his \nreporting requirements. The security officer sees no reason why Applicant would not \n\n \n \n10 \ncontinue to report any information as required. He has demonstrated an understanding \nof his responsibilities and of the reporting requirements. (AE R.) \n \n \nOn his return to his employment with the federally-funded research and \ndevelopment laboratory in April 2015, Applicant made a major but seamless transition \nfrom a hardware engineer to a systems analysis role. His overall performance for 2015 \nwas rated as very good, and excellent in the areas of technical breadth, productivity, and \nteaming. By the time of his performance rating for 2016, he had become one of the \nprimary technical contributors to a DOD study and a U.S. military demonstration initiative. \nHe was an asset to his group in that he was able to support both systems analysis and \nhardware development efforts. In 2017, Applicant traveled extensively to military sites and \nbriefed military officers and government officials as a key contributor in his area of growing \nexpertise. His overall performance for 2017 was rated as outstanding. In February 2018, \nhe was promoted to technical staff, where he is now responsible for technical and financial \noversight of his programs. (Tr. 32, 34.) He proved to be good at prioritizing program goals \nand tasks, and paying attention to staffing needs and finances to make sure that program \ngoals were met on time. Applicant was given an outstanding performance rating for 2018. \n(AE U; Tr. 35.) Noting Applicant\u2019s dedication to performing above time and above \nexpectations on projects, his rating supervisor advised him to find a sustainable work-life \nbalance to ensure that he does not get burned out. (AE U.) \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor provided a character reference letter (AE E) and also \ntestified for Applicant. He has known Applicant since April 2015, initially as an officemate \nand colleague, and since October 2017 as his supervisor. He has had the opportunity to \nobserve Applicant\u2019s work on a daily basis, and to travel with Applicant extensively to U.S. \nmilitary installations. They have a close relationship outside of work as well. He was best \nman at Applicant\u2019s wedding, and he and his wife have had multiple social interactions \nwith Applicant and his spouse. He has met Applicant\u2019s family, including extended family \nmembers who attended Applicant\u2019s wedding, and attests to the close relationship \nApplicant has with his family. He also met Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s parents and brother at the \nwedding and indicates that Applicant\u2019s in-laws continue to be \u201cnot particularly happy\u201d \nabout the marriage. He believes that their racism about Applicant\u2019s paternal heritage is \nthe root cause of their disinterest in having a relationship with Applicant. The \nsupervisor/friend opined that Applicant\u2019s spouse does not have a particularly warm \nrelationship with her parents, and that her relationship with them has declined drastically \nas Applicant\u2019s spouse has become \u201cAmericanized in her thinking and actions.\u201d In his \nopinion, her parents are disappointed with her for staying in the United States and not \nreturning to China to help them; that her mother feels that she has lost control of her \ndaughter, \u201cwho is not displaying the appropriate thankfulness for the sacrifices that they \nmade for her education and who is not submissive enough to her parent\u2019s wishes for who \nshe should marry.\u201d Applicant\u2019s supervisor/friend is aware of the SOR, but he does not \nshare the concerns. Applicant is \u201cone of the most fastidious and careful people [he knows] \nof when it comes to handling classified information.\u201d He explained that, because of the \nnature of their work, there is no good security classification guidance. Applicant is \nextremely concerned about the aggregation of information and does not discuss his work \noutside of the office. He has no concerns about Applicant\u2019s ability to handle classified \n\n \n \n11 \ninformation appropriately. (AE E; Tr. 129-140, 144-145.) Applicant has \u201ca stellar \nreputation\u201d at work. (Tr. 134.) The supervisor/friend knows that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law \nhas some affiliation with the Chinese government. (Tr. 148.) In his opinion, Applicant does \nnot have a relationship with his spouse\u2019s Chinese family to exploit. (Tr. 143.) Based on \nhis observations, the supervisor/friend believes that Applicant would probably choose the \nU.S. interests over his spouse\u2019s interests in the event of undue pressure. (Tr. 144-145.) \nHe elaborated that all Applicant has wanted to do in life is to help the government or make \nit better. He expressed confidence that Applicant would report any attempts at foreign \ninfluence. (Tr. 149, 151.) \n \n \nA work colleague of Applicant\u2019s since July 2015 has partnered with Applicant on \nseveral projects. She testified for him and provided a character reference letter (AE G). \nShe attests to Applicant being \u201chighly detail oriented [and] hyper-aware of operational \nsecurity.\u201d They have developed a friendship, and in that regard, she knows Applicant to \nbe dedicated to his volunteer activities, including presently as the alumni president \noverseeing a massive house renovation for the local chapter of his fraternity. This \ncolleague/friend knows that Applicant \u201cdoes not particularly like his wife\u2019s family.\u201d (Tr. \n175.) He made it clear to her that he considers his in-laws to be rude and insensitive; that \nif he and his spouse have any children, they will be raised only in the United States; and \nthat he will limit his spouse\u2019s family\u2019s interactions with them. (Tr. 175-176.) Applicant has \nnot given his colleague/friend any indication to doubt his loyalty. He has been vigilant \nabout the confidentiality and sensitivity of his work. He does not take work home and \nchooses instead to spend late hours at the laboratory to ensure that deadlines are met. \nHe inspires his co-workers to care about their projects. (AE G; Tr. 171-.176.)  \n \n \nA former senior advisor for the U.S. military, who is an attorney in the U.S. \nReserves, now has his own consulting company. (Tr. 81, 153-154.) He testified for \nApplicant and also authored a character reference letter (AE F). He strongly endorses \nApplicant for continued security clearance eligibility. He met Applicant through their work \non behalf of a branch of the U.S. military and has witnessed Applicant\u2019s growth \u201cas a \nleader and innovator in increasingly important national security and defense issues.\u201d \nApplicant has always been focused on their mission and committed to operational security \npractices. He believes denying Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for a security clearance \nwould be \u201ca grave mistake and a significant setback to U.S. national security interests in \nan area of emerging importance.\u201d (AE F.) Applicant has the highest reputation among \ntheir very broad network for his capabilities and contributions; for his integrity and \nhonesty; and for his ability to maintain a high level of security. (Tr. 160.) Applicant treats \nhis work \u201cas a mission.\u201d (Tr. 162.) He does not believe Applicant would be subject to \nforeign influence. (Tr. 164-168.) \n \n \nA friend of Applicant\u2019s, who works as a subcontractor for Applicant\u2019s employer, met \nApplicant when they were both entrepreneurs. He has witnessed Applicant\u2019s dedication \nto his job and to America. In his experience, Applicant \u201cfirmly firewalls his professional \nand personal lives.\u201d He will spend nights and weekends at the office if necessary. He \nattests that Applicant has expressed that he cannot and will not divulge information about \nhis work no matter the pressure. On travels together, Applicant has shared plenty about \n\n \n \n12 \nhis family with this friend, but nothing about his spouse\u2019s family. This friend knows that \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws are Chinese and that it is \u201can undeniable fact that China actively \nengages in espionage targeting America and the Department of Defense.\u201d Yet he \nwholeheartedly supports Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. (AE H.) \n \n \nA consultant in national security, who retired in October 2014 from full-time \nemployment as president and chief executive officer of a defense contractor, knows \nApplicant through their fraternity. The consultant\u2019s son was in the fraternity with Applicant, \nand the consultant was an active alumnus. Applicant was the local chapter\u2019s vice \npresident while an undergraduate, and he impressed the consultant with his leadership \nability. More recently, as president of the alumni house corporation, Applicant stepped up \nto help the chapter recover from a membership crisis, and he has led the efforts for \ninfrastructure improvements and renovations. Applicant has been \u201copen and transparent \nabout [his spouse\u2019s] Chinese heritage\u201d and about her relatives. Based on his interactions \nwith Applicant and knowledge of Applicant\u2019s background, the security consultant is \nconfident that Applicant is loyal to the United States and its security interests. (AE I.) \n \n \nA licensed attorney, who attended college with Applicant and joined the same \nfraternity, has developed a close friendship with Applicant over the past 13 years. \nApplicant discussed with him the possible effect that his marriage to a Chinese national \ncould have on his security clearance eligibility. This friend attests that Applicant married \n\u201cafter much consideration and with full belief that he could undertake both without \nadversely impairing either.\u201d As a groomsman at Applicant\u2019s wedding, this friend observed \nApplicant to be cordial to his in-laws, \u201cwho strongly considered not attending the \nwedding.\u201d In his observation, Applicant is extremely close to his own family, and he is \n\u201centrenched\u201d in his community. This friend has no reservations about trusting Applicant \nwith the responsibilities of a security clearance. (AE J.) \n \n \nAnother of their fraternity brothers currently works as a mechanical engineer for a \ndefense contractor. This friend invested in Applicant\u2019s start-up energy company. He \nindicates that when Applicant closed the company, he paid back his investors because \nhe wanted to honor the trust that they had placed in him. He knows Applicant as someone \nvery conscious about his work and its sensitivity. He believes Applicant is a loyal citizen \nof the United States who will place the interests of the United States first. (AE K.) \n \n \nThe president of the fraternity house corporation before Applicant has had limited \nopportunities to interact with Applicant and his spouse socially. In his contacts with \nApplicant through their fraternity, he has seen Applicant react calmly and thoughtfully in \nstressful and sensitive situations. He does not believe that Applicant poses any threat to \nthe United States. (AE L.) \n \n \nA married couple with whom Applicant and his spouse share a friendship \n\u201cunequivocally pledge [their] support\u201d of Applicant. He has given these friends no reason \nto doubt his character or his loyalty. The female friend interacted with Applicant through \nshared university alumni activities from 2005 to 2007.  Applicant became reacquainted \nwith her and met her husband in 2014, when he joined their weekly co-ed sports team. \n\n \n \n13 \nThe couple attended Applicant\u2019s wedding and consider him to be a \u201cloving husband and \na trustworthy friend.\u201d (AE M.) \n \n \nApplicant remains close to his family, although he has told them that if anything \nimproper were to occur involving them, all he could do is report it to the government. (Tr. \n77.) Applicant\u2019s mother, sister, maternal grandparents, and maternal uncles favorably \nendorse his character and reliability and confirm Applicant\u2019s close ties to the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s mother, who works in the housekeeping business, indicates that her \nson \u201cdoes things by the book and doesn\u2019t let anyone pressure him into decisions.\u201d He has \nhigh morals, and she has no doubt that he is a loyal U.S. citizen. She knows where \nApplicant is employed but not what he does or where he travels for work. To her \nknowledge, Applicant has limited contact with his spouse\u2019s family; his in-laws do not like \nhim; and they did not want the marriage. She regards Applicant\u2019s spouse as a daughter \nand part of their American family. (AE N.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister corroborates that Applicant\u2019s spouse became part of their family \nactivities when she and Applicant were dating, and that his marriage has not changed his \ncore values of honesty and integrity. Applicant\u2019s sister has always been able to trust him \nto give her rational, helpful advice. She knows of no one more consistent and stable as \nApplicant. He does not take his work lightly and has not shared the nature of his work \nwith her. (AE Q.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandparents expressed their pride in Applicant. They were \ninvolved in raising him, including taking him to his sports games out of town. They knew \nbefore Applicant\u2019s wedding that there was some tension because of his in-laws\u2019 \ndisapproval of the marriage, although \u201ceveryone got along fine during the wedding.\u201d To \ntheir understanding, Applicant\u2019s in-laws play \u201ca very minor role\u201d in Applicant\u2019s and his \nspouse\u2019s lives in the United States. (AE O.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncles have maintained a close relationship with Applicant even though \nthey live in another area of the country. In their experience, Applicant is determined in \naccomplishing his tasks and goals. Their family has adopted a policy of not asking him \nabout his work because he will not tell them. Applicant\u2019s uncles found Applicant\u2019s in-laws \nto be courteous and polite at the wedding, despite their disapproval of the marriage \nbecause Applicant is not Chinese. Applicant\u2019s uncles strongly doubt that there is anything \nthat Applicant\u2019s in-laws could say to him that would dissuade him from doing what is right. \n(AE P.) \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n   \n \nAfter reviewing U.S. government publications concerning China and its foreign \nrelations and mindful of my obligation to consider updated information, I take \nadministrative notice of the facts requested by the Government as supplemented by the \nfollowing facts: \n \n\n \n \n14 \nChina is an authoritarian state with paramount authority vested in the CCP. CCP \nmembers hold almost all top government and security apparatus positions. In all important \ngovernment, economic, and cultural institutions in China, the CCP ensures that party and \nstate policy guidance is followed. China considers the first 20 years of this century to be \na window of strategic opportunity for the country to focus on economic growth, \nindependent innovation, scientific and technical advancement, and growth in renewable \nenergy. China sees itself as a strategic competitor of the United States. \n \nChina continues to pursue a long-term, comprehensive military modernization \nprogram, which it views as essential to achieving the \u201cChina Dream\u201d of a powerful and \nprosperous China. As of 2018, China was placing a growing emphasis on the importance \nof maritime and information domains, offensive air operations, long-distance mobility \noperations, and space and cyber operations. China is one of the most aggressive \ncollectors of U.S. economic information and technology. To support its military \nmodernization, China fills the gaps in its defense and commercial research by engaging \nin large-scale, state-sponsored theft of intellectual property and proprietary information. \nIn accord with its national security objective to leverage legally and illegally acquired dual-\nuse and military-related technologies to its advantage, China uses its intelligence \nservices, computer intrusions, and other illicit approaches to obtain national security and \nexport-controlled technologies, controlled equipment, and other materials. China \nleverages foreign investments, commercial joint ventures, academic exchanges, the \nexperience of Chinese students and researchers, and state-sponsored industrial and \ntechnical espionage to increase the level of technologies and expertise available to \nsupport its military research, development, and acquisition. China blends intelligence and \nnon-intelligence assets and frequently seeks to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with \nfamily ties to China who can use their insider access to steal trade secrets from U.S. \ncompanies. \n \nU.S. corporations and cyber-security specialists continue to report computer \nnetwork intrusions originating from Internet Protocol addresses in China. In March 2016, \na Chinese national plead guilty to participating in a conspiracy between approximately \nOctober 2008 through March 2014 to hack into the computer networks of major U.S. \ndefense contractors to steal sensitive military and export-controlled data for the benefit of \nChina. Some Chinese nationals in the United States have acted as procurement agents \nor intermediaries to obtain key national security and export-restricted technologies or \ncontrolled equipment for China in violation of U.S. laws and export controls. In June 2016, \na California resident was convicted of conspiring with a person in China to illegally acquire \nand export to China fighter jet engines, an unmanned aerial vehicle, and related technical \ndata to China. In March 2017, a U.S. State Department employee with a Top Secret \nclearance was charged with making false statements to the FBI for allegedly failing to \nreport her contacts with two Chinese foreign intelligence agents, who provided her with \nthousands of dollars of gifts and benefits over a span of five years. \n \nIn June 2018, a former Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) officer, was arrested for \nthe attempted transmission of national defense information to China\u2019s intelligence \nservices and for acting as an unregistered foreign agent for China. Fluent in Mandarin \n\n \n \n15 \nChinese and Russian, he held a Top Secret clearance for several years. Between 2013 \nand 2017, he regularly traveled between the United States and China and allegedly \nprovided information that he learned at military and intelligence conferences in the United \nStates to contacts in China associated with the country\u2019s intelligence services. He also \nallegedly improperly sold export-controlled technology to persons in China. He was \nreportedly paid at least $800,000 for his activities on China\u2019s behalf. \n \nIn another illustration of China targeting former and present U.S. security clearance \nholders, in June 2018, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case officer, who had \nalso worked for the DIA in the past, was convicted of espionage for transmitting classified \ndocuments to an agent of the Chinese government. In September 2018, a Chinese citizen \nliving in Chicago was arrested for allegedly acting within the United States as an illegal \nagent for China. According to the criminal complaint, the Chinese national came to the \nUnited States on a student visa to study electrical engineering in 2013. In 2016, he \nenlisted in the U.S. Army Reserves under a program authorizing the recruitment of legal \naliens with skills considered vital to the national interest, denying at that time that he had \nany contact with a foreign government in the past seven years. He allegedly worked at \nthe direction of a high-level intelligence officer in a provincial department of the Ministry \nof State Security for the PRC. In October 2018, a Chinese intelligence officer was charged \nwith economic espionage involving the theft of trade secrets from multiple U.S. aviation \nand aerospace companies. In a separate case, two Chinese intelligence officers who \nworked for a provincial foreign intelligence arm of China\u2019s Ministry of State Security and \ntheir team of hackers were charged in October 2018 with conspiracy to steal technology \nunderlying a turbofan engine used in U.S. and European commercial airlines. The criminal \ncomputer intrusions reportedly targeted several private companies and persisted \nbetween January 2010 and May 2015. In reporting the charges, the FBI noted that \u201cthe \nthreat posed by Chinese government-sponsored hacking activity is real and relentless.\u201d \n \nChina has a poor human rights record. The government was responsible for \nsignificant human rights issues in 2017, including arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life \nand executions without due process; forced disappearances; torture and coerced \nconfessions of prisoners; arbitrary and illegal detentions; restrictions on freedom of \nspeech, press, assembly, association, religion, and travel; harassment of journalists, \nlawyers, writers, dissidents, and others; censorship and tight control of public discourse \non the Internet, in the print, and other media; inability of citizens to choose their \ngovernment; corruption; severe repression of human rights organizations and individuals; \nsevere labor restrictions; and a coercive birth-limitation policy. The CCP continued to \ndominate the judiciary and controlled the appointment of judges. In some cases, the CCP \ndirectly dictated court rulings. \n  \nThe U.S. State Department advises visitors to China to exercise increased caution \ndue to arbitrary enforcement of local laws as well as special restrictions on U.S.-Chinese \nnationals. Chinese authorities have asserted broad authority to prohibit U.S. citizens from \nleaving China by using exit bans coercively to compel U.S. citizens to participate in \nChinese government investigations; to lure individuals back to China from abroad; and to \naid Chinese authorities in resolving civil disputes in favor of Chinese parties. The State \n\n \n \n16 \nDepartment warns that U.S. citizens may be detained in China without access to U.S. \nconsular services, and they may be subjected to prolonged interrogation and extended \ndetention for reasons related to \u201cstate security.\u201d China does not recognize dual nationality \nand U.S.-Chinese citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be subject to \nadditional scrutiny and harassment. Visitors are required to register with the police within \n24 hours of arrival in the country and failure to do so could result in fines and deportation. \nForeign visitors in China may be placed under surveillance by security personnel; their \nhotel rooms, telephones, and facsimile machines may be monitored; and their personal \npossessions, including computers, may be searched without their knowledge or consent. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \n\n \n \n17 \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s parents, her twin brother and his wife, and her grandmother \nare resident citizens of China. Review of Applicant\u2019s contacts and connections to these \nforeign citizens is warranted to determine whether they present a heightened risk under \nAG \u00b6 7(a) or AG \u00b6 7(e) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those \ndisqualifying conditions provide: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n\n \n \n18 \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the family ties or \nother foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing \nwhether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the foreign \ngovernment; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United \nStates. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the administrative judge must \ntake into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case \nNo. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of his or her spouse. See e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 11-12659 (App. Bd. May 30, 2013). Applicant had in-person contact with his spouse\u2019s \nparents and brother during his trips to China to meet them in September 2015 and in \nSeptember 2017 for their post-wedding celebration for his spouse\u2019s family and friends, \nwho did not attend their wedding in the United States. He had quarterly contact by text \nmessage with these in-laws as of October 2018, only on birthdays and major holidays, \nand they responded politely in Chinese. His contact with his brother-in-law\u2019s wife was less \nfrequent. Applicant had in-person contact with his spouse\u2019s grandmother, only when he \nwas in China. He has had no other contact with his spouse\u2019s grandmother, who has made \nracist comments about him. On receiving the SOR, Applicant decided to have no future \ncommunications with his spouse\u2019s family members. Applicant credibly denies any close \nbonds to his spouse\u2019s family members, who do not approve of him because of their \ncultural and class prejudices and racism. They openly expressed their disapproval of his \nmarriage to their daughter and have shown little interest in getting to know him. His \nrelationship with them does not trigger AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse indicates that she does not have a close relationship with any \nof her family members in China. A close friend and work colleague of Applicant\u2019s testified \nthat Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law are displeased with their daughter for not coming home to \nChina and for not showing appropriate gratitude for the sacrifices they made for her. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s contact with her family has decreased significantly as her ties to \nAmerica have increased, and particularly since they have not accepted Applicant. Even \nso, these family members are not completely estranged from her. Her parents and her \ntwin brother and his wife attended her wedding to Applicant in the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s parents and grandmother gave her monetary gifts on her marriage. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse sent $1,000 to her brother on the birth of his son. Out of respect for \nher parents, Applicant\u2019s spouse and Applicant had an informal celebration of their \nwedding in China in September 2017. She continues to contact her family members in \nChina by text messaging once a month. \n \nChina is an authoritarian state with an extensive, pervasive history of engaging in \neconomic and technological espionage against the United States, including in recent \n\n \n \n19 \nyears using cybercrime to steal sensitive information and technologies. China also has a \npoor human rights record in many aspects. Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law continue to work \npart time at a Chinese college affiliated with a state university; they are members of the \nCCP; and her mother serves as the CCP\u2019s representative to the university\u2019s professors \nand other instructors regarding retirement issues. While there is no evidence that \nintelligence operations from China seek or have sought classified information or sensitive \neconomic technologies from or through Applicant, his spouse, or her relatives living in \nChina, nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. Applicant \nlives with and is close to his spouse. Her relationships and ongoing contacts with her \nfamily members in China create a risk of indirect foreign influence through her and \nestablish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 7(b) and AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \nThe burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the risk of undue foreign influence that \nexists because of his ties through his spouse to China, a country known to target U.S. \ncitizens to obtain classified or sensitive information, including persons who have held \nsensitive positions and clearances. AG \u00b6 8(a) provides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply because of the country involved. In recent years, Chinese \nintelligence agents operating from within and outside the United States have targeted \ninsiders in sensitive government positions and the defense industry to obtain highly \nclassified information. Cyber hacks originating from China intended to benefit China are \nlikely to continue. Applicant could find himself in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of his spouse\u2019s family members and the interests of the United States. \n \nApplicant credibly denies any loyalty to China or to his spouse\u2019s relatives in China. \nAt the same time, it is difficult to satisfy the first part of AG \u00b6 8(b). Chinese authorities \ncould conceivably bring some pressure on his spouse\u2019s family in China and create a \nconflict between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive technology and a desire to help \nhis spouse. AG \u00b6 8(b) provides: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established, however, in that Applicant\u2019s relationships and loyalties in \nthe United States are so deep and longstanding that he can be counted on to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. A lifelong resident citizen of the United \nStates, Applicant was raised to be a loyal American. He was educated in the United States \n\n \n \n20 \nand has pursued his career here. His contributions to his employer and the U.S. military \nhave been considerable. All of the persons to whom he is bound by feelings of affection \n(spouse, mother, sister, grandparents, uncles and other extended family members) are \nin the United States. His spouse has yet to acquire her U.S. citizenship, but she has U.S. \npermanent residency; she does not intend to travel to China unless her family members \nfall gravely ill or die; and she intends to become a naturalized U.S. citizen as soon as she \nis eligible. Should she and Applicant have any children, her parents will have to travel to \nthe United States to see them. Applicant and his spouse own their condominium and have \nother considerable financial assets in the United States. Applicant has no assets in China, \nand while his spouse has a bank account in China, the balance is minimal and cannot be \naccessed from abroad. \n \nIn weighing Applicant\u2019s relationship with the United States against the potential \nconflict of interest, it is significant to note the deterioration in his spouse\u2019s relationship with \nher family living in China. Her choices to stay in the United States to pursue her life and \ncareer, and especially to marry Applicant despite their expressed disapproval of him, \nshow that her family has little control over her. She recognizes the importance of \nApplicant\u2019s job to him and the distant nature of her relationship with her family in China \nmakes her less likely to ask Applicant to help them in the event of any undue foreign \ninfluence. Given their prejudicial attitudes toward him, Applicant is not likely to succumb \nto pressure or influence from them or act on their behalf. \n \nMoreover, AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual \nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence \nor exploitation,\u201d has some applicability. Applicant has cut off all contact with his spouse\u2019s \nfamily members in China. When he had contact previously, it was limited to polite \nexchanges and nothing more. His spouse\u2019s contacts by text message on a monthly basis \nwith her parents, brother, and grandmother, and three to four times a year with her sister-\nin-law are ongoing, but superficial in nature. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or \norganizations form a foreign country,\u201d also has some applicability. The chief security \nofficer for Applicant\u2019s employer indicates that Applicant has been \u201cpurposeful and timely\u201d \nin reporting all required updates to his personal background. He reported his marriage to \na Chinese national and he reported her relatives. Applicant has given the security \nmanager no reason to believe that Applicant would not continue to report any information \nrequired of him because of his security clearance eligibility. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Those factors are as follows: \n \n\n \n \n21 \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nIn foreign influence cases, it must be acknowledged that people act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a family member. \nAs stated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, \n2009), \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but \nmerely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with \nchoices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family member.\u201d Moreover, in \nevaluating Guideline B concerns, the Appeal Board has held that: \n \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \n \nApplicant cannot control the actions of the Chinese government, intelligence, or \nsecurity services, but he can control his response if placed in the untenable position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests of his \nspouse\u2019s family members in China. He indicated that if undue pressure was to be placed \non him, he would report it, even if the person making the improper inquiry was his spouse. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, who is well-acquainted with Applicant and his spouse, believes \nthat Applicant would choose the interests of the United States over the interests of his \nspouse if faced with that situation. Although not controlling, it is relevant that Applicant \nhas demonstrated that he can be counted on to handle classified information \nappropriately. He is known \u201cas a leader and innovator in increasingly important national \nsecurity and defense issues.\u201d Applicant\u2019s supervisor and work colleagues attest to his \ncommitment to his work and to the importance with which he takes his security \nresponsibilities. They believe it is in the best interest of the U.S. to continue Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility and that it would be a mistake to do otherwise. \n \nApplicant has also shown that he can be relied on to comply with his reporting \nrequirements. He informed security officials at work about his trips to China, about his \nmarriage to a Chinese national, and about his in-laws in China. He has received \ncounterintelligence briefings and is likely to recognize any attempt at undue influence or \n\n \n \n22 \npressure and to report it to the proper authorities. He entered into his marriage with a \nChinese national only after giving careful due consideration to whether he could continue \nto adhere to his security responsibilities. There is no indication whatsoever that he has \nbetrayed the confidence placed in him. \n \nCertainly, Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law\u2019s memberships in the CCP, his mother-in-\nlaw\u2019s position as a representative of the CCP to the university, and his in-laws\u2019 continued \nwork on behalf of the Chinese college raise significant security concerns, but they are not \nper se disqualifying. After considering all the facts and circumstances, including the \nimportance of Applicant\u2019s work to him, his awareness of the potential risks posed by his \nmarital ties to China, and the strained relations he has with his spouse\u2019s family in China, \nI find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue security clearance \neligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She discussed her taxes and these\ndebts, but was confronted with the other SOR debts, during an interview with a \nGovernment investigator on 13 April 2018, based on her April 2017 credit report (Item \n4\n7).  She stated her intent to address the listed debts.\nHowever, except as stated above, Applicant documented no efforts to address her \ndebts, either after her interview or after she received the SOR. She did not attribute her \nfinancial problems to any particular circumstance, and she provided scant explanation of \nher unemployment periods\u2014the last of which ended in September 2016. She provided \nno budget or financial statement. She has not documented any financial or credit \ncounseling.

Each decision must \nalso reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, \nspecific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case can be measured \nagainst them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant \nAG is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.5 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of \nfinancial difficulties for which she did not provide any documentation of efforts to resolve \nher debts, or file her delinquent tax returns.6 \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. \nShe has not clearly documented any efforts to resolve them.7 Applicant did not document \nthat her financial problems were due to circumstances beyond her control, and she \ndocumented no efforts to resolve them, either after her subject interview or after she \nreceived the SOR or FORM. 8 Applicant has had no credit or financial counseling, and \n5See, Department of the Navy v.

(GE 2)  \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from May 2017 and June 2018, the SOR \nalleged nine debts that became delinquent between 2012 and 2016, and totaled $21,295. \n(GE 4, 5) The status of each debt is as follows: \n \n  \n1. (1.a) The $10,730 charged-off account is for an automobile car lease. The car \nwas repossessed in 2013. He said he was unaware of the debt until he received \nthe SOR. He thought his friend had assumed the lease. On May 15, 2019, \nApplicant sent a letter to the creditor inquiring about a settlement. The creditor \nagreed to a final payment of $2,682, which Applicant paid on May 24, 2019. \nThe debt is resolved. (Tr. 50-57; AE L, M, N, O)  \n  \n \n2.

(I.h) The $306 debt owed to a cable company is unresolved. Applicant is \ndisputing it because he said he returned the company\u2019s equipment. He sent a \nletter on May 15, 2019, to the creditor offering to settle it for $76. (Tr. 72-73; AE \nI)    \n \n9. (1.i) The $304 debt owed to a cable company was settled for $197 and paid on \nMay 14, 2019. It is resolved. (Tr. 75; AE P)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted his budget. His net monthly income is $2,500; his wife\u2019s net \nincome is about $2,400 each month. They share expenses. Sometimes they have money \nremaining after paying bills, depending on unforeseen expenses. (Tr. 43-44, 76-79; AE \nR) He said he does not have any delinquent debts not listed in the SOR. He and his wife \nreview their budget every two weeks. (Tr. 81-82) His wife does not receive child support \nfor her children.

(Tr. 80) \n \n \nApplicant stated that in November or December 2018 his wife became seriously \nill. She was hospitalized and then placed in an acute rehabilitation facility. He said that \nshe was in either the hospital or facility for over three months. He said she was unable to \nwork some of that time. His wife was helping him address the delinquent debts until she \nbecame ill. In May 2018, they began sending letters to creditors in an attempt to settle \ndebts. (Tr. 54-58; AE V) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nAlong with his answers to interrogatories in August 2018, Applicant submitted two \nletters of recommendation. A colleague, who previously worked with Applicant as a \nmilitary liaison for a department, stated that Applicant is a capable, reliable, and dedicated \nemployee. A career specialist commended Applicant for his superior work ethic and \nleadership abilities. (GE 3)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant had a history of not resolving debts that became delinquent between \n2012 and 2016. He began addressing them in 2018. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out four conditions that could potentially mitigate \nthose financial security concerns under this guideline: \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts had been ongoing for at least three or four \nyears before he began to address them in 2018. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant \nadmitted that early in his Army career he made a poor decision when he began helping \nfamily members with their financial problems, instead of managing his debts. That \ndecision was a circumstance within his control. He did not attempt to responsibly manage \nthe delinquent debts until he began the security clearance process. The evidence does \nnot establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \nApplicant received financial counseling through a program with the military. \nRecently, he paid three debts, totaling $16,265, demonstrating that they are now under \ncontrol. He established mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) as to those debts. Within the past two \nmonths, he initiated a plan to resolve the remaining six debts, totaling $5,030, by \nsubmitting proposals to the creditors for settlements. His recent efforts are not construed \nas having been fully made in good faith, and thus, establish limited mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 20(d).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent 32-year-old man, who honorably served in the Army for \n11 years, including one extended deployment. Since 2018, he has worked for a defense \ncontractor, who strongly supports his request for a security clearance. Applicant testified \ncandidly about his delinquent debts. He and his wife review their budget every two weeks, \nand monitor their finances. He acknowledged that it took him time to address his debts, \nbut, with his wife\u2019s assistance, he established a plan that resolved three large debts and \nwill help resolve the remaining six debts. After listening to his testimony and observing \nhis demeanor, I believe that he will continue to address the six outstanding debts that \ntotal $5,030, and will manage his finances responsibly in the future. The record evidence \nleaves me without concerns as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and suitability for a security \nclearance. Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under the financial \nconsiderations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i: \n \n    \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On October 22, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 14, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2019.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on March 21, \n2019, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on May 8, 2019. The Government \noffered four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were \n\n \n2 \n \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered two exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits A and B, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 15, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 37 years old.  He is married and has two children.  He has a \nBachelor\u2019s of Science degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. He is employed \nby a defense contractor as a Test Engineer/Hardware.  He is seeking to obtain a \nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR identified fourteen delinquent debts totaling almost $400,000.  \nApplicant denies each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, except 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., and \n1.n.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated July 25, 2017; and October 2, 2018, reflect \nthat the debts are still owing.  (Government Exhibits 2 and 3.) \n       \n \nApplicant was born in Kampala, Uganda in September 1982.  He came to the \nUnited States as a teenager in March 1999.  His mother was granted asylum here, and \nhe and his siblings were allowed to come with her.  Applicant became a naturalized \nUnited States citizen in 2003.  Applicant wanted to pursue the American dream of \nattending college and getting a good job to support his family.  He took out student \nloans to pay for college with hopes that his education would help him in his career.  He \nplanned to pay off the loans when he started work.  He also co-signed for some of his \nwife\u2019s student loans and his brother\u2019s student loans.  He also has some delinquent \nconsumer debt and a few delinquent medical bills.  He attributes some of his delinquent \ndebt to long periods of unemployment.  Applicant was unemployed from February 2013 \nto March 2014; October 2014 to February 2015; and November 2015 to January 2017. \nApplicant had difficulty finding work and even worked as a truck driver in order to make \nends meet.         \n \n \nApplicant started working for his current employer in 2017.  He stated that he has \nnever received financial counseling but he has contacted a credit counselor to help him \nwith his delinquent debt, but has not yet hired them.  (Tr. p. 53.)  Applicant has not been \nable to afford to pay his delinquent debt and most of the debt listed in the SOR remains \nowing.  He plans is to start by paying the smaller debt first, and when those debts are \nresolved, he will begin with the others.  Applicant received a letter from one of his \nstudent loan creditors who informed him that to avoid wage garnishment he was to \nestablish a payment plan by September 2018.  Applicant thought that it would be better \nto simply allow the creditor to garnish his wages.  His wages are currently being \n\n \n3 \n \ngarnished in the amount of $700 monthly to pay the debts set forth in allegation 1.d and \n1.e., of the SOR, which total approximately $81,000.       \n \n \nAfter taxes and the garnishment, Applicant states that he nets about $3,600 \nmonthly, $1,800 per pay period.  (Tr. p. 67.)  His wife now works part-time.  After they \nhave paid their regular monthly expenses including rent, car insurance, utilities, food, \nclothing, telephones, child care, etc., they have some money left over that Applicant \nputs into his savings accounts.  He currently has about $10,000 in a savings account \nand $20,000 in his retirement account.  (Tr. p. 72-73.)   \n \n \nThe following delinquent debts remain owing: \n \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a student loan account that was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $105,111.           \n \n1.b.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a student loan account that was charged off \nin the approximate amount of $62,090.    \n \n1.c.   Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $59,844.          \n \n1.d.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed in collection in \nthe approximate amount of $54,828. Applicant states that this debt is being paid through \npayroll garnishment in the amount of $700 per month.       \n       \n1.e.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $24,604.  Applicant states that this debt is being paid through \npayroll garnishment in the amount of $700 per month.       \n \n1.f.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the in the \napproximate amount of $9,658.   \n \n1.g. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $1,811.          \n \n1.h.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $1,491.        \n \n1.i.   Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe amount of approximate amount of $489.        \n \n1.j.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a medical account in the approximate amount \nof $446.             \n \n1.k.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $121.        \n \n\n \n4 \n \n1.l.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $66,058.   \n \n1.m.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $10,000.        \n \n1.n.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $6,762.   \n \n \nTwo debts owed to one creditor set forth in allegations 1.d., and 1.e., are being \npaid through wage garnishment.  Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquent debt is still \noutstanding.  Applicant testified that he hopes to get his finances in order and be able to \npay his delinquent debts soon.  His career plan is to work in the defense industry and \nutilize the skills he acquired through his formal education.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant is excessively indebted and has not made any effort to resolve his \ndebts.  Of the fourteen debts listed in the SOR, one is being paid through garnishment \n\n \n6 \n \nof his wages.  Even his smaller debts have not been paid.  The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand   \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s financial distress has been partially caused by the long period of \nunemployment he has experienced.  Even so, since obtaining full-time employment with \na defense contractor in 2017, Applicant has done little to show that he can or will \nresolve his debts.  He states that he is planning to hire a credit counselor, yet he has \nnot done so yet.  There has been little or no movement with his debts since the SOR \nwas issued.  One creditor is being paid through wage garnishment.  Applicant has not \nset up payment plans that he is following, nor has he paid off any of the outstanding \ndebt.  There is no clear evidence in the record that he has acted reasonably and \nresponsibly under the circumstances.  His actions reflect unreliability, untrustworthiness, \nand poor judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1.n.   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Meyer, Esq. \n \n11/01/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. He mitigated the security concern under Guidelines H, Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse and J, Criminal Conduct. National security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 1, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse, J, Criminal \nConduct, and E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on June 21, 2019. He requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 27, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \non September 12, 2019, for a hearing on October 8, 2019, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented three \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I, which were admitted. I kept \nthe record open until October 22, 2019, and Applicant timely submitted one document, \nwhich was marked as AE J, and admitted into the record without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 1, 2019.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old. He works as a geospatial analyst for a defense \ncontractor. He is married and has one daughter. He graduated from high school in 2007, \nand obtained an associate\u2019s degree as well as an undergraduate in 2016-2017. (GE 2) \nHe served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2009 until 2014, receiving an honorable \ndischarge. (GE 1) He has held a security clearance since about 2010. (GE 1) He has \nbeen employed with his current employer for about two years. (Tr. 16) Applicant \nacknowledged that he was briefed regarding the use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 18) \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana infrequently over the course of 2007 \nthrough 2014 while holding a security clearance. (SOR 1.a-b) He also admitted that he \nused marijuana from September 2012 to January 2014 while employed in a sensitive \nposition on an active duty military base. (SOR 1.c) He was aware of the policy of zero \ntolerance for drug use. (Tr. 18) Applicant testified that he used the marijuana infrequently \nand when he was on leave from the military. He reports his last use was in 2014. (AE D) \nHe described the circumstances involving the use of marijuana.  When he visited his \nwife\u2019s cousins in 2013, he was offered a lit joint and he did not turn it down. (Tr. 27) He \nknows that he could have turned it down, but he did not. In 2014, he again used marijuana \nwith his wife\u2019s cousin at a party. \n \n \nApplicant does not associate with these family members anymore. He attended a \ndrug abuse session and obtained an evaluation report in June 2019, which reflected that \na clinical interview and an assessment tool combined with a urinalysis was conducted in \n2019. The evaluator did a follow up in October 2019, and Applicant does not meet criteria \nfor substance abuse disorder. (AE I, J) He has never tested positive in a drug test. He \nsigned a letter of intent not to abuse any drug in the future on March 17, 2019. (AE E) He \ndiscussed the illegal use with his wife and recently with his supervisor. (Tr. 33) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nAs to SOR 2.a, the SOR cross-alleged the information as set forth in SOR 1.a-1.c. \nHe has not smoked marijuana or any illegal drug since 2014. He admits that his actions \nwere wrong and illegal. He has been evaluated for drug abuse. He does not associate \nwith the people with whom he used. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant admitted in response to his SOR that he never disclosed his use of \nmarijuana in any of his SCAs since 2011. This included when he was processing for a \nhigher clearance with another agency in 2015. (GE 3) The agency denied his security \nclearance.  (GE 6, 7, and 8)He appealed the decision but was denied. (GE 3) Nor did he \nvoluntarily divulge the information during a 2017 investigative interview. (GE 2) \n \n \nAs to SOR 3.a, Applicant admitted that he falsified material facts during a personal \nsubject interview on June 8, 2017, with an authorized investigator with OPM. He denied \nany drug use in response to all questions under Section 23. He explained that he was \nscared and knew that he had incidents from 2012 and 2013, and knew it would hurt his \nchances of seeking a higher clearance. \n \n \nAs to SOR 3.b, Applicant admitted that he falsified material facts on his August 17, \n2016, SCA in response to Section 23- Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity in the last \nseven years. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d as to whether he intentionally engage in the misuse \nof prescription drugs. \n \n \nAs to SOR 3.c, Applicant admitted that in his August 17, 2016 SCA in Section 22 \n\u2013 Illegal Drug Use While Holding a Security Clearance, he did not disclose any of his \nmarijuana use. \n \n \nAs to SOR 3.d, Applicant admitted that he intentionally falsified material facts on \nhis December 19, 2011, SCA by answering \u201cNo\u201d to all questions relating to illegal drug \nuse in the past seven years.  \n \n \nApplicant reports that he is a mature man and not the young and stupid person he \nwas before. He explained that he would never jeopardize the United States regarding \nclassified information. He does not want to make any more mistakes. He emphasized that \nthe events happened when he was on leave from the military. (Tr. 20) \n \nApplicant submitted five letters of recommendation. Each letter attests to his \nhonesty and trustworthiness. His wife, his sister-in-law, a college friend, and a colleague \npraise Applicant for his professionalism, work ethic and good judgment. The letters \ndescribe Applicant as a good father, worker and a good man. (AE H) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThree witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant at the hearing. His wife described \nhim as very reliable and a good father. She explained that he does not use marijuana or \nany drug. She stated that he has always been a rule follower. (Tr.48) \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law and co-worker testified that Applicant is very quiet and \nreserved, but task oriented. She believes he makes good choices for his family. She \nrecommends him for a security clearance. The witness did not know of the issues of \nnondisclosure of his use of marijuana over the years on his SCAs. (Tr. 58-60) \n \nApplicant\u2019s colleague testified that Applicant is trustworthy and reliable. When \nApplicant is abroad working, he is very professional. He works well under stress. He was \nnot aware of the nondisclosures, but would still recommend him. (Tr. 64) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement \u2026 to \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndetermine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities. \n \n  \nApplicant admitted that he did not list any illegal drug use in any of his SCAs or \ninvestigative interviews due to fear of not gaining or retaining a security clearance. He \nquite candidly stated that he was scared. It was only when confronted that he stated that \nhe has used marijuana and while holding a security clearance. This falsification lasted \nuntil 2017. SOR 16(a) applies. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant did not report specific use of marijuana, on any of his numerous SCAs \nor during various interviews. He admitted that he intentionally falsified his applications for \nfear of negative consequences. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) do not provide mitigation \nfor the personal conduct concerns arising under these circumstances. \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \nand \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2007 until 2014. He \nobtained an evaluation and does not currently have a substance abuse problem.  He has \nhad no other incidents. The concerns under criminal conduct are cross alleged from the \nconcerns under the drug guideline. Applicant\u2019s use at varying frequency satisfies AG \n31(b) as marijuana remains illegal under Federal law. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant has mitigated the criminal conduct concerns due to the passage \nof time, his lack of association with the persons involved, and the fact that he has \nbeen drug free for several years. He signed a letter of intent in 2019. He has \nexcellent work references and has seen a counselor. He has had no recurrence of \nincidents since 2014. AG 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2007 through 2014. From \nJanuary 2012 to January 2014, Applicant used marijuana while holding a security \nclearance. He continued his use of marijuana while serving on active duty in the U.S. \nArmy from 2012 until 2014.  Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are established.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \n \n \n \n        Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in 2014. I find that sufficient time has transpired \nfor mitigation in this case given the period of time in his life that he illegally used drugs. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nHe did seek help from a counselor and no longer associates with the persons with whom \nhe smoked. He signed a Letter of Intent in 2019.  I find mitigation under Guideline H. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is respected by those \nthat know him. He performs well at work. He was in the U.S. Army and was honorably \ndischarged because they were unaware of his illegal drug use. He has worked at his \ncurrent employment for several years. He has held a security clearance since 2010. He \nhas excellent letters of recommendation. He has not had any criminal incidents since \n2014. He admitted and obtained a clinical evaluation concerning the drug use and also \nhad a follow up evaluation in October 2019. He acknowledged that he is not the same \nperson as before. He never tested positive for drugs. He has removed himself from those \npersons associated with drug use. He signed a letter of Iitent. He is described as a good \nfather by his wife. \n \nApplicant did not report on at least four SCAs any involvement with drug use. This \nis troubling. In his interview in 2017, he did not volunteer any information concerning \ndrugs. He also did not admit use in a screening with another agency. He admits that he \nwas scared and did not want any negative effects on his job or security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of deliberate falsifications over more than a five-year period \nundermines his credibility, and engenders serious questions regarding his suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I have doubts and questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nconcerns under Guidelines J and H, but failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline E.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted failing to timely file his 2012-2017 Federal income tax returns, 3 and accumulating almost $8,900 delinquent debt.4 He is a 47-year-old program manager employed by a U.S. defense contractor since November 2012. He has been continuously employed since January 2001. He served honorably in the U.S. military in the 1990s, during which time he held a clearance. He has not previously held an industrial clearance (Item 3). Applicant married his first wife in June 1996, and they divorced in August 2010; he remarried in October 2011 and divorced in August 2012. He has three adult children from his first marriage.

Tilford, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n05/09/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the record in this case,1 I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance. \nOn 18 December 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. 2  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a decision without \nhearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The record in this case \nclosed 23 April 2019, when Department Counsel stated no objection to Applicant\u2019s \nResponse. DOHA assigned the case to me 29 April 2019. \n1Consisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-6, and Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM \n(Response). \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective 8 June 2017. \n1 \n\nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted failing to timely file his 2012-2017 Federal income tax \nreturns, 3 and accumulating almost $8,900 delinquent debt.4 He is a 47-year-old program \nmanager employed by a U.S. defense contractor since November 2012. He has been \ncontinuously employed since January 2001. He served honorably in the U.S. military in \nthe 1990s, during which time he held a clearance. He has not previously held an \nindustrial clearance (Item 3). \n     \nApplicant married his first wife in June 1996, and they divorced in August 2010; \nhe remarried in October 2011 and divorced in August 2012. He has three adult children \nfrom his first marriage. \n           \nApplicant disclosed his failure to file his 2015 Federal income tax return on his \nMay 2017 clearance application (Item 3), and discussed that return, as well as his 2012 \nand 2016 returns, and SOR debt 1.l, during his September 2017 interview with a \nGovernment investigator (Item 6), based on his June 2017 credit report (Item 5). 5  He \nclaimed to have placed SOR debt 1.l in a debt consolidation program in July 2017, and \nto be working with a tax accountant. In his November 2018 answer to DOHA \ninterrogatories (Item 6), he documented entering a commercial tax resolution program in \nSeptember 2018, covering his 2012-2017 Federal income taxes, and making the first \nprogram payment in October 2018. He later documented $900 monthly payments for \nApril and May 2019, with payments scheduled for June-October 2019. 6  Applicant \nclaimed, but did not document, having difficulty dealing with the IRS. Thus, he turned to \nthe tax resolution program to resolve his taxes, which remain unfiled. \nApplicant\u2019s March 2019 Answer (Item 2) contained an email, later confirmed by a \nmore legible document from the debt resolution program (Response), reflecting that he \nenrolled seven debts totaling $13,685.37 in the program, and settled them for \n$7,086.54, an approximate discount of 48%. 7  The settled debts include a debt not \nalleged in the SOR, SOR debts 1.c-1.e, SOR debts 1.h and 1.l, and a debt purporting to \nbe SOR debt 1.i. However, Applicant\u2019s credit reports and Response show that the debt \npaid is not the debt alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s June 2017 credit report (Item 5), reflects that Applicant had two \naccounts with the SOR 1.i creditor, one opened in August 2015, one opened in \n3The Government withdrew SOR 1.b, regarding Applicant\u2019s state income tax returns (FORM, p.2). \n4He denied three debts totaling about $3,000, pending verification, which he apparently obtained later. \n5The remaining SOR debts were taken from Applicant\u2019s September 2018 credit report, which was never \ndiscussed with an investigator. \n6It is unclear whether any portion of these payments is sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). \n7However, the documents do not indicate when each debt was satisfied. \n2 \n\nNovember 2016. Each account is identified by its full 16-digit account number in Item 5. \nAt the time, both accounts were current. Applicant\u2019s September 2018 credit report (Item \n4) also lists both accounts. The August 2015 account is listed by the first four digits, four \nx\u2019s, and the third four digits. The November 2016 account is listed by the first 12 digits. \nThis account also shows that it was closed at consumer\u2019s request after having been \npaid for less than full balance in November 2017. The first 12 digits under which the \naccount is listed in Item 4 match the first 12 digits under which the account is listed in \nItem 5. The last four digits listed for this creditor in Applicant\u2019s Response match the last \nfour digits in Item 5. Consequently, the debt Applicant paid on this creditor is not the \ndebt alleged at SOR 1.i, which remains unaddressed. \nIn addition, although Applicant\u2019s June 2017 credit report (Item 5) lists only one \ndelinquent SOR debt (SOR 1.l),8  it lists several debts which later became SOR debts, \nsome with full account numbers, that were current at the time, but which were \ndelinquent on the September 2018 credit report (Item 4), whether still held by the \noriginal creditor or by a collection agent. First, SOR debt 1.c was current in June 2016, \nlisted under the original creditor, with a complete account number, but was delinquent in \nSeptember 2018 under the collection agent. 9  The last four digits listed for the original \ncreditor in Applicant\u2019s response matches the last four digits of the original creditor in \nItem 5. Second, SOR 1.e appears under the original creditor, with full account number, \nas current in Item 5, but then tracks to Item 4 with the first 12 digits as delinquent but \ntransferred; it then appears under the SOR 1.e collection agent, with the first eight \ndigits. Again, the last four digits listed for the original creditor in Applicant\u2019s Response \nmatches the last four digits of the original creditor in Item 5. Third, SOR debt 1.h, with \nfull account number, was current on Item 5, but was delinquent under the same creditor \nwith a 12-digit account number, and settled under the last four digits in Applicant\u2019s \nResponse. Finally, SOR debt 1.k  was current, with full account number, on Item 5, but \nwas delinquent on Item 4 under the first four digits. Applicant claimed that he paid this \ncreditor directly, but too recently for it to be reflected on a credit report (Response). He \nprovided no confirmation of his claim to have paid SOR debt 1.g online. \nApplicant\u2019s Response contains an April 2019 email from the collection agent for \nSOR debt 1.f, acknowledging Applicant\u2019s acceptance of the collection agent\u2019s \nsettlement offer, but not containing any actual indication that the settlement amount was \npaid. Similarly, Applicant provided an April 2019 letter from the collection agent for SOR \ndebt 1.j asserting the SOR amount alleged; Applicant annotated the letter that the debt \nwas paid the same day, but did not otherwise document payment. \n8SOR debt 1.l alleged an original creditor with an eight digit account number, being held by a collection agent. \nApplicant\u2019s Response lists only the original creditor, under a last four digits that does not match Item 5. Only \nthe original creditor and original debt alleged connects the settlement payment to Item 5. \n9Applicant gets some credit for connecting the creditor in Item 5 with the creditor in Item 4, given no obvious \nconnection in the credit reports. \n3 \n\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his divorce, but the record evidence \ndoes not support that claim. He provided no evidence showing that his August 2012 \ndivorce caused him to not file his 2012-2017 Federal income tax returnsnone of which \nhad been filed over six years after the divorce. He failed to show that the ten delinquent \ndebts\u2014all of which were listed as being opened 2015-2018\u2014were caused by the 2012 \ndivorce.10 He specifically stated that SOR debt 1.l was caused by his children going over \ntheir minutes\u2019 limits on their cell phones. \nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a \nbudget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community \ninvolvement. He submitted no current credit reports which might have corroborated his \nclaimed payments. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability \nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, \nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the \nGovernment.11 \n10Two of the debts held by collection agents are listed as opened in 2018, presumably when they received the \naccounts from the original creditors. The accounts with the original creditors were opened in 2015 or 2016. \n11See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n4 \n\nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his \nFederal income tax returns between 2012 and 2017. He has stated no credible reason \nfor his failure, and did not corroborate any claimed contacts with the IRS. Applicant \nengaged professional tax help in September 2018, but theses efforts have yet to result \nin filed income tax returns or documented payments to the IRS. Regarding the ten \ndelinquent debts, Applicant claimed to have engaged a debt resolution program to \nresolve seven SOR debts in July 2017, but provided no documentation of when he \nengaged the program. The program settled six of the SOR debts, with no indication \nwhen the debts were settled or paid. Applicant claimed, without documentation to show \nactual payments, to have personally paid four SOR debts. Even accepting Applicant\u2019s \nproffers as true, the claimed payments were made after he received the FORM. SOR \ndebt 1.i remains unpaid.12  \nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access \nto classified information. Indeed, the Board has previously \nnoted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their \nlegal obligation to file income tax returns may be said not to \nhave demonstrated the high degree of judgment and \nreliability required for access to classified information.\u201d13 \nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful14  or attributed to the press of other \ncircumstances.15  As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of \nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal \nor state income tax returns for 10 years. \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal \nobligation. Applicant\u2019s . . . failure to have done so for many \nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling \n12\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \n13ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge\u2019s favorable decision. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years). \n14See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester). \n15See, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file). \n5 \n\n \nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that \ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A \nperson who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 \n(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the \nJudge noted, Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 19(g) explicitly \nprovides that failure to file tax returns is a circumstance that \ncan raise a security concern. Moreover, the Directive \npresumes a nexus between admitted or proven conduct \nunder any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nclearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 9, 2015). \nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an \nApplicant is financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case \nhis failure to timely file his Federal returns for at least eight years has created significant \ntax debt that he has not addressed. \n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His \nfailures to timely file his Federal returns are multiple, recent, and the circumstances are \nnot demonstrated to be unlikely to recur.16  Moreover, he has not demonstrated that his \nfailures to timely file and his subsequent failures to timely pay or make pay \narrangements were due to circumstances beyond his control, and it is clear that he has \nnot been responsible in addressing his taxes. 17  Similarly, his delinquent debts all \noccurred several years after his most recent divorce, and all involved accounts opened \nseveral years after his divorce. He did not show how his divorce could have influenced \nthese accounts, and while he has documented five settled SOR accounts, his \ndocuments do not show when the debts were paid, precluding a judgment on the \nreasonableness of his actions. His four SOR debts purportedly paid after he received \nthe FORM, were not responsibly dealt with on their faces, as was the omitted debt. \nApplicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, although five of the \ndebts were settled, however untimely.18  The absence of payment on one account, late \n16\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n17\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n18\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that \nthe problem is being resolved or is under control; \n6 \n\n      \npayment on four other accounts, and the absence of dates on the six settled accounts \nmeans Applicant cannot demonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve his \ndebts. The missing details of his tax resolution program requires the same conclusion \nregarding his taxes. 19  Moreover, he submitted no work or character evidence which \nmight support a whole-person assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by \nhis conduct.

On \nOctober 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n\n4 \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, and failure to pay his \ndelinquent debts or set up any payment plans raises two disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d. \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n5 \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or \nirresponsible spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, a history of late paymenys or of non-\npayment, or other negative financial indicators. \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentation that any of the delinquent accounts have \nbeen addressed or paid.  He was unemployed for a short time but he presented no nexus \nto the delinquent accounts. Neither did he present any specific information concerning his \ndivorces.  He admitted that he owes some debts and promises to pay and set up plans. \nHowever, he provided no documentation to confirm his assertions. There is no information \nin the record as to his current salary. It is impossible to know if he is financially stable. \nApplicant has furnished insufficient information to meet his burden. There is no record of \nfinancial counseling. He provided no information that the accounts were not his accounts. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n6 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant is thrice divorced and has two adult children. He has worked as a \ndefense contractor for several employers.    \n \n \nThe record does not provide sufficient information as to why Applicant accrued so \nmany debts. He was unemployed for a short time. He wants to pay his debts and promises \nto set up plans. He did not submit any documentation that he has done anything to resolve \nhis accounts, or that he does not owe them. He has not received financial counseling. \nThere is no information as to his salary and ability to pay his debts.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in approximately March 1997 that was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2000 and then discharged in March 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that she filed in December 2007 for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was voluntarily dismissed in February 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that she filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2011 that was discharged in June 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Additionally, as of the issuance of the SOR on November 9, 2018, Applicant allegedly owed delinquent medical debt totaling $18,463 on nine accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.l). (Item 1.) When she responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted the bankruptcies and debts. She explained that she had been unaware of the medical debts before her interview; that she had recently paid off medical bills from her spouse\u2019s bypass surgery; and that she would work on paying off the SOR debts once she returns to work. (Item 4.) After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 4), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 57-year-old high school graduate. She was twice married and divorced before marrying her current spouse in May 2004. She has three daughters, a son, and a stepdaughter, who are now all adults. Applicant worked as a dispatcher for a county sheriff before entering the defense industry in September 2004. Applicant then worked as a secretary for a federal contractor for 9.",

Promises to pay debts at some \nfuture date are not a substitute for a track record of timely repayment. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn November 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing a security \nconcern under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n2 \n \nOn December 4, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). On January 24, 2019, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), consisting of ten exhibits (Items 1-10). DOHA forwarded a copy \nof the FORM to Applicant and instructed her to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on February 5, 2019, and she submitted a timely response that was \naccepted without any objections by the Government on February 27, 2019. On March 12, \n2019, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with \nnational security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case \nassignment on March 14, 2019, and accepted Applicant\u2019s FORM response in the record as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 10 a summary report of a subject interview \nof Applicant conducted on August 21, 2018. The summary report was part of the DOD \nReport of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD \npersonnel background report of investigation may be received in evidence and considered \nwith an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules \nof Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication required for admissibility \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of her opportunity to \nobject to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of her opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that she wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant was \nadvised as follows: \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview is being provided to the Administrative Judge for \nconsideration as part of the record evidence in this case. In your response to \nthis File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can comment on whether the \nsummary of your Personal Subject Interview accurately reflects the \ninformation you provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can \nmake any corrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make \nthe summary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground \nthat the report is unauthenticated by a Government witness and the \ndocument may not be considered as evidence. If no objections are raised in \nyour response to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections to \nthe admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as evidence \nin your case. \n  \n\n3 \n \n  \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded her if she was represented by legal counsel. She was \nadvised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that she may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, she was \nadvised that she is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by her or proven by Department Counsel, and that she has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not \nspecifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on \nsufficient notice of her opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview summary \nreport, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or \nupdates to the information in the report. She did not file any objections in her rebuttal (AE \nA) to the FORM. In the absence of any objections or indication that the interview summary \nreport contains inaccurate information, I accepted Item 10 in evidence, subject to issues of \nrelevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n  \n  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nin approximately March 1997 that was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October \n2000 and then discharged in March 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that she filed in December 2007 for \na Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was voluntarily dismissed in February 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and \nthat she filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2011 that was discharged in June \n2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Additionally, as of the issuance of the SOR on November 9, 2018, \nApplicant allegedly owed delinquent medical debt totaling $18,463 on nine accounts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.l). (Item 1.) When she responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted the \nbankruptcies and debts. She explained that she had been unaware of the medical debts \nbefore her interview; that she had recently paid off medical bills from her spouse\u2019s bypass \nsurgery; and that she would work on paying off the SOR debts once she returns to work. \n(Item 4.) \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 4), \nand AE A, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old high school graduate. She was twice married and \ndivorced before marrying her current spouse in May 2004. She has three daughters, a son, \nand a stepdaughter, who are now all adults. Applicant worked as a dispatcher for a county \nsheriff before entering the defense industry in September 2004. Applicant then worked as a \nsecretary for a federal contractor for 9.5 years. When her then employer lost the contract in \nApril 2014, she was hired by the new contractor. She was still employed full time when she \ntook a second job, 39 hours per week, in March 2018. She worked alternating schedules \nfor the two companies until June 2018, when she resigned from her full-time job. In August \n2018, her part-time employer took her on as a full-time employee. (Items 5, 10.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s first marriage lasted ten years. In June 1990, she married her second \nhusband. Together they purchased a new home with the intention of renting out their \nprevious residence. The file does not contain any information about when they acquired \n\n4 \n \ntheir new home or about the mortgages on the two homes. According to Applicant, their \ntenant did not pay rent for almost a year. The same day that they had their tenant served \nwith an eviction notice, the house caught fire. For almost two years, they had to pay the \nmortgage on the property while getting it repaired to re-rent it. Having to pay two mortgages \nplaced Applicant and her then spouse in a financial bind. (Item 4.) In late March 1997, they \nfiled a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan was confirmed in \nJuly 1997 and then modified before they voluntarily converted to a no-asset Chapter 7 filing \nin October 2000 for reasons not clear in the evidentiary record. In early March 2001, they \nwere granted an automatic discharge in bankruptcy, and their case was closed in late April \n2001 (Item 6),1  shortly after their divorce in March 2001. (Item 5.) \n \nThree years into her current marriage, Applicant and her spouse filed a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition in December 2007, after completing required credit counseling. \nApplicant indicated in response to the SOR that they were both \u201cleft in financial trouble by \n[their] previous marriages,\u201d although bankruptcy docket information shows that Applicant\u2019s \ndebt was discharged shortly before her divorce. Perhaps she reaffirmed debts, but it is \nunclear. She had previously explained in August 2018 that she had filed for bankruptcy \nbecause she had a car loan, a personal loan for a motorcycle, and a credit card debt with a \njeweler that she could not repay. (Items 4, 7, 10.) In February 2008, their Chapter 13 plan \nwas confirmed, and they completed a post-petition financial management course. An \namended plan was confirmed in July 2009. In January 2011, Applicant and her spouse \nfiled for a voluntary dismissal of their Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Their Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nwas dismissed in February 2011 (Item 7), and they filed a no-asset Chapter 7 voluntary \npetition.2  In April 2011, the bankruptcy trustee filed a report of no distribution. In June \n2011, they were granted an automatic discharge under Chapter 7. (Item 8.) The amount of \ndebt discharged is not in the record. Applicant and her spouse converted their bankruptcy \nto a Chapter 7 in part because they had unexpected expenses after taking full custody of \nher two-year-old granddaughter.3 (Items 4, 10.) \n \nOn April 24, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) for a clearance for her current \nemployer. In response to financial delinquencies involving enforcement, Applicant listed \n$800 in medical bills for bypass surgery for her spouse. She indicated that she was paying \nthe consolidated balance at $200 a month and that it should be paid off in a few months. \n(Item 5.) \n                                                 \n1 The file does not contain their bankruptcy petition, so the nature and amount of debt discharged is unclear. \nItem 6 includes only the court docket information, which reflects the conversion from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 \nand the discharge. \n \n2 Applicant indicated in response to the SOR that she and her spouse filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nDecember 2007, which they converted to a Chapter 13 in 2011. (Item 4.) Docket records indicate conversely \nthat they had the Chapter 13 dismissed and then filed a Chapter 7 no-asset bankruptcy. (Items 7-8.) \n \n3 During her subject interview in August 2018, Applicant attributed the bankruptcy conversion in part to medical \nissues for her spouse, who had bypass surgery. The medical debts in the SOR were placed for collection \nbetween November 2012 and September 2017. Applicant has been repaying other medical debts in collection \nthat were incurred between October 2013 and July 2018. (AE A.) It is unclear to what extent, if any, her \nspouse\u2019s medical issues were a factor in the bankruptcy filing in 2007, or in its conversion in 2011.  \n\n5 \n \nAs of June 13, 2018, Applicant had no delinquent consumer loans or credit cards on \nher credit record. She had a department store credit card with a balance of $1,928 and a \njoint home-furnishings charge card with a balance of $2,159. Payments on those accounts \nwere timely. A $21,776 car loan had been paid off in January 2015. Some medical debts \nhad been or were still in collection. A $146 medical debt placed in March 2012 was paid in \nSeptember 2012. A $353 medical debt placed in November 2012 was paid in April 2013. \nMedical debts of $44 and $40 placed in November 2014 were paid in October 2017. \nHowever, she still owed $18,463 in past-due medical debt: $9,532 in collection since June \n2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $50 in collection since June 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $50 in collection since \nSeptember 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.f ); $4,947 in collection since December 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1. g); $91 \nin collection since November 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); $126 in collection since April 2015 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.i ); $817 in collection since September 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); and $1,330 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and \n$1,520 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) in collection since February 2015. (Item 9.) \n \nOn August 21, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) about her financial record. She discussed her \n2011 Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, which she had previously not disclosed because it was \nfiled over seven years prior to her SF 86. She attributed the filing to being unable to pay \nseveral accounts because of her spouse\u2019s medical issues and having had to obtain \ncustody of her granddaughter. She could not recall the amount of her and her spouse\u2019s \nlisted liabilities or assets but indicated that all listed debt had been discharged. She \nmaintained that her financial situation has been stable since then, except for medical bills \nincurred for her spouse\u2019s surgery. About her previously disclosed medical delinquency, \nApplicant related that she and her spouse were liable for about $3,200 in medical \nexpenses for his surgery. She indicated that she has been making payments of $200 a \nmonth to a receivables company since September 2017 to resolve the debts. When \nconfronted about the outstanding medical collection debts on her credit record, Applicant \nstated that the accounts were being paid together through one payment of $200 a month. \n(Item 10.) \n \nOn November 9, 2018, the DOD CAF issued the SOR to Applicant because of her \nhistory of bankruptcies and the unpaid medical collection debts on her June 2018 credit \nreport. (Item 1.) When she responded to the SOR on December 4, 2018, Applicant \nindicated that she had not known about the SOR debts before her interview. She explained \nthat the largest medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $9,532 had never been submitted to her \nmedical insurer. She indicated that she had just finished her payments to the receivables \ncompany for other medical debts, and that she would work on resolving the SOR debts \nonce she is able to return to work. (Item 4.) She provided no information at that time about \nthe reasons for, or the duration of, her absence from work, or of its impact on her \nhousehold finances. \n \nIn rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant submitted documentation from the receivables \ncompany showing that she fully resolved $888 in medical debt incurred on her account \nbetween October 2013 and July 2018.4 Applicant explained that her spouse had his own \n                                                 \n4 The records of the receivables company show transactions in various amounts between September 27, \n2017, and October 12, 2018. They appear to represent the dates of disbursements to the creditors rather than \n\n6 \n \nmedical bills for his bypass surgery that they were repaying. Regarding the SOR debts, she \nasserted she was presently unable to make any repayment arrangements because she \nhas been out of work since before Thanksgiving in November 2018. It appears that the \nsecurity clearance process was a factor in that she stated, \u201cAs this process is becoming \nlong term it\u2019s also causing more of a financial burden.\u201d (AE A.) She attributed her history of \nfinancial delinquencies to \u201cseveral devastating life events that [she] had no control over,\u201d \nalthough she did not elaborate about those events. (AE A.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n                                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant\u2019s payments. (AE A.) Assuming that Applicant had an agreement to pay $200 a month to the \nreceivables company starting in September 2017, it should not have taken her a year to pay off $888 in debt. \nShe indicated in August 2018 that she was still paying $200 a month (Item 10), and in December 2018 that \nshe had \u201cjust recently\u201d paid off her husband\u2019s medical bills through the receivables company. (Item 4.) Either \nshe failed to make consistent payments or her substantiating documentation is incomplete. \n\n7 \n \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The concern under Guideline F is \nbroader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise classified \ninformation in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. \n \n \nApplicant has had a history of financial difficulties in the last 20 years. She was \nafforded a financial fresh start in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in March 2001, shortly \nbefore she and her second husband were divorced. Three years later, she married her \ncurrent spouse, who may have brought some debt into the marriage. By December 2007, \nApplicant was financially overextended in that she had loans for a car and motorcycle and \na credit debt for jewelry that she could not afford to repay. She and her current spouse filed \na joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that they had voluntarily dismissed in February 2011. \nThey refiled seeking a Chapter 7 discharge of their liability to repay their indebtedness, and \nthey were granted that relief in June 2011. Applicant\u2019s June 2018 credit report shows no \nrecent delinquency on consumer credit accounts, but medical debts totaling $18,463 were \nin collection. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for her financial \njudgment raised by her bankruptcies and the medical collection debts. Application of the \naforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating \n\n8 \n \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20. Four of the seven mitigating conditions warrant some \nconsideration and could potentially apply in whole or in part. They are: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability in that Applicant\u2019s bankruptcies were filed, and \nthe debts covered by her Chapter 7 filings were discharged, more than five years ago. \nSome of the medical debts have been in collection for over five years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h) \nwhile other medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($50) and 1.j ($817)) were assigned in September \n2017. Applicant provided no documentation about the medical debts, so it is difficult to \nconclude whether some or all stem from a medical procedure or event that is not likely to \nrecur. The disparate dates for the medical debts suggest that they were not all for her \nspouse\u2019s bypass surgery as she had claimed during her subject interview. Even if the debts \nbecame delinquent several years ago, they are still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d  See ISCR \nCase No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate such ongoing delinquency. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability, although in that regard, Applicant provided little \ndetail about the \u201cseveral devastating life events\u201d outside of her control that impacted her \nfinances. She indicated that her and her second husband\u2019s bankruptcy was to alleviate \nfinancial stress caused by having to make two mortgage payments when a tenant failed to \npay the rent for almost a year, and they had to repair the home after a fire. Those adverse \ncircumstances were not within her control, but it is also unclear whether Applicant acted \nfully responsibly. She presented no information about her household income or her \nexpenses, including the amount of the mortgages or the expenses associated with the \nproperty cleanup and repair. \n \n\n9 \n \n \nConcerning Applicant and her current spouse\u2019s bankruptcy filed in December 2007, \nApplicant explained that both she and her husband were left in financial trouble from their \nprevious marriages. The evidence shows that she had a financial fresh start after her \nprevious marriage. She admitted during her subject interview that she had car and \nmotorcycle loans, as well as some credit-card debt. It appears that she overextended \nherself financially following her bankruptcy discharge and divorce in 2001. Nonetheless, \ncosts associated with taking custody of her granddaughter were an unexpected expense \nand a significant factor in the voluntary dismissal of the December 2007 Chapter 13 filing in \nfavor of a Chapter 7 filing in February 2011. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse required bypass surgery that caused some unexpected \nexpenses triggering AG \u00b6 20(b). Such medical expenses are not discretionary, and do not \ncarry the same financial judgment concerns as had Applicant abused consumer credit. \nEven so, the nexus between her spouse\u2019s medical treatment and the medical collection \ndebts in the SOR was not clearly shown. Even if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially \narose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside of her control, I have to consider \nwhether Applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with her financial difficulties. \nSee ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether \nApplicant maintained contact with her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. Applicant\u2019s evidence falls considerably short in that \nregard. She stated during her August 2018 OPM interview that the SOR collection debts on \nher credit record were being repaid at $200 a month. When she responded to the SOR in \nDecember 2018, she discrepantly stated that she was unaware of the medical debts before \nher interview, and that she intends to address the SOR debts once she returns to work, but \nthere is no evidence that she has contacted the creditors to advise them of her financial \nsituation. With no information in the record about her household income or expenses, it is \ndifficult to determine whether Applicant has acted responsibly toward the medical creditors \nin the SOR, two of whom are owed only $50 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f). \n \n \nApplicant has demonstrated some improvement in her handling of her financial \nmatters since her June 2011 bankruptcy discharge by her timely repayment of her car loan \nand credit-card debts in recent years. Also viewed favorably are her payments to the \nreceivables company from September 2017 to February 2019 that paid off $888 of medical \ndebt. The Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that she has \npaid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR.5 \n                                                 \n5 The Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 07-06482, decided on May 21, 2008, in part: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept of \n\u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \npayment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). \nHowever, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that [she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that [she] has \u201c. . . \nestablished a plan to resolve [her] financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The \n\n10 \n \nHowever, an applicant needs to show that she has a plan to resolve her debts and that she \nhas taken significant steps to implement her plan. Applicant expressed an intention to \nbegin addressing the medical debts in the SOR, which total approximately $18,463, when \nshe returns to work. A promise to pay debts at some future date is not a substitute for a \ntrack record of timely payments. See ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n \n \nAvailable information does not enable a predictive judgment that Applicant can be \ncounted on to make payments toward the medical collection debts in the SOR. She has \nrepeatedly asserted that she was paying the receivables company $200 a month, but \npayment records confirm repayment of only $888 of medical debt through the company. \nApplicant presented no income or expense information from which I could extrapolate that \nher financial situation is stable. She has been off the job since November 2018, when the \nSOR was issued. Applicant is not presently in a situation where she is able or willing to \nreach out to her SOR creditors about repayment arrangements. AG \u00b6 20(c) has some \napplicability in that the debts that caused her to file the bankruptcies are no longer an \nissue. However, neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) can reasonably mitigate the medical \ncollection debts, which continue to be ignored. Too many unanswered questions exist \nabout her present financial situation. The record evidence falls considerably short of \nmitigating the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant has worked for a succession of federal contactors on the same base since \nSeptember 2004. She presented no employment or character references attesting to her \njudgment and reliability on the job, although good performance may reasonably be inferred \nfrom her consistent employment on the base. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that \nthe government need not wait until an applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified \ninformation before denying or revoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009, citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. \nCir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \n                                                                                                                                                             \njudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and her actions \nin evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of her outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in \nreaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Apr.4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n\n11 \n \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Applicant owes \nsome $18,463 in medical collection debt that she now claims first came to her attention \nduring her August 2018 interview with the OPM investigator. She had previously indicated \nmistakenly or wrongly that she was making $200 monthly payments toward the \ndelinquencies on her credit record. A significant component of financial responsibility is \nbeing attentive to one\u2019s finances, including knowing whether they were being paid. \nApplicant\u2019s repayment of some $888 in other medical debt is not enough to fully mitigate \nthe concerns about her financial judgment. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a security \nclearance in the future. After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the \nevidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

Edmunds, Esq. \n11/13/2019 \nDecision \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny her \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant, a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen from China, failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by \nher familial relationships with individuals who are citizens of China. Clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nThe DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder the foreign influence guideline on November 9, 2018. The DOD CAF took this \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well \nas DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented \non June 8, 2017. Based on the available information, DOD adjudicators were unable to \nfind that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance and recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether to revoke or deny Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The Government \nserved discovery on Applicant on February 25, 2019. The Government\u2019s discovery letter \n\n \n2 \n \nis appended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE I). At the hearing, convened on May 5, \n2019, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough Y without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, as did three character \nwitnesses on her behalf. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 13, 2019. On \nSeptember 5, 2019, Applicant forwarded a document related to her husband\u2019s \ncitizenship status. This document is admitted to the record as AE Z, without objection \nfrom Department Counsel.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nSOR Amendment \n \nWithout objection from Applicant, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to \nwithdraw SOR \u00b6 1.a, which alleged that Applicant\u2019s husband is citizen of China. (Tr. 8.) \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nregarding the People\u2019s Republic of China. Without objection from Applicant, I approved \nthe request and the document is appended to the record as HE II. (Tr. 10-11.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 50, has worked for university-affiliated research institutes as a \nmaterials scientist since at least 2005. Her current employer, also a university-affiliated \nresearch institute, hired her in July 2017 and she began working on projects in August \n2018. Her current research is sponsored by the DOD. Throughout her career, Applicant \nhas published 70 articles in U.S.-based journals and has given presentations at \nconferences sponsored by U.S entities. She has participated in three international \nconferences in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan. She does not have any \ncontinuing contact with any people she may have met during those events. She \ncompleted a security clearance application, her first, in August 2017, disclosing eight \nrelatives who are citizens and residents of China, as well as two relatives who are \nChinese citizens residing in the United States. These relationships serve as the basis \nfor the SOR allegations. (Tr. 47-48, 93-99; GE 1, AE C.) \n \n \nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen from The People\u2019s Republic of China \n(China). China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is \nthe paramount authority. CCP members hold almost all top government and security \napparatus positions. Chinese leaders are focused on developing the capabilities they \ndeem necessary to deter or defeat adversary power projection and counter third-parties \nincluding the United States in conflicts. China's military modernization is producing \ncapabilities that have the potential to reduce core U.S. military technological \nadvantages. The National Counterintelligence Executive has identified China and \nRussia as the most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information and technology. \nChina's intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, frequently \nseek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their \n\n \n3 \n \ninsider access to steal secrets. Agents of the Chinese government are the world's most \nactive and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage. Chinese attempts to collect \nU.S. technological and economic information continue and represent a persistent threat \nto U.S. economic security. (HE II.) \n \nIn assessing the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic \nrelationship between the U.S. and China, the U.S.-China Economic and Security \nReview Commission has reported that the Chinese government has conducted \nlarge-scale cyber espionage against the United States. China has compromised a range \nof U.S. networks, including those of DOD, defense contractors, and private enterprises. \nChina's substantial and sustained investment in defense research and development \n(R&D) has helped China improve its military-industrial complex. China's state sponsored \ntheft of intellectual property and proprietary information has allowed China to fill \nknowledge gaps in its domestic defense and commercial R&D. (HE II.) \n \nChinese government repression and coercion against organizations and \nindividuals involved in civil and political rights advocacy, and public interest and ethnic \nminority issues occurs. Human rights concerns in China include: repression of speech, \nreligion, association, assembly, the press, and movement for certain minorities; \nextrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention; torture and \ncoerced confessions of prisoners; a lack of due process in judicial proceedings; \nsearches of premises without warrants; monitoring of communications (including \ntelephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text messaging, and Internet \ncommunications); and opening of domestic and international mail. Additionally, citizens \nlacked the right to change their government and had limited forms of redress against the \ngovernment. (HE II.) \n \nApplicant completed her undergraduate and masters education at the university \nin her hometown. Between 1991 and 1994, she worked for a China-based research \ninstitute. Applicant does not maintain any contacts with anyone from that employment. \nShe immigrated to the United States in 1997 to commence studies on her doctoral \ndegree, which she completed in 2001. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May \n2010 and obtained a U.S. passport. When she traveled to China in 2013, entering the \ncountry with her U.S. passport, Chinese immigration officials cut the corners of her \nChinese passport, invalidating the document. (Tr. 60-64; GE 1-2.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband is also originally from China. He immigrated to the United \nStates in 1991 on a student visa to complete his education. He then remained in the \nUnited States on an employment visa. The couple met in 2008 and married in June \n2009. He applied for U.S. citizenship after their marriage. For unexplained reasons, his \napplication stalled after he completed the fingerprinting process and in-person interview. \nHe filed a second application in April 2019 at Applicant\u2019s request and became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in September 2019. Applicant\u2019s husband works as an engineer \nin the private sector. He also works as a financial planner. Applicant and her husband \nhave one child together, who is a U.S. citizen by birth. Applicant\u2019s husband also has two \nadult children from his first marriage, who are also U.S. citizens by birth. (Tr. 66-68, 99-\n102; GE 1.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, stepmother, and oldest brother are residents and citizens of \nChina. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) Applicant\u2019s father, 79, is a retired professor. He taught at a \nuniversity in Applicant\u2019s hometown, not her alma mater. The record is silent as to her \nfather\u2019s area of expertise. Her stepmother, 68, retired from her position as a computer \nengineer at a hospital. Before receiving the SOR, Applicant spoked to her father by \nphone at least once per month. She spoke to her stepmother less often. Applicant \nwould also send her parents a $3,000 lump sum each year to use toward their care and \nmedical expenses. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) After receiving the SOR, Applicant reduced telephone \ncontact to emergency occasions only. She also stopped sending financial support. \nApplicant\u2019s parents have traveled to the United States four times to visit Applicant, their \nmost recent visit occurring in August 2018. Each trip lasted six months, and they stayed \nin Applicant\u2019s home. Applicant\u2019s father knows Applicant requires a security clearance, \nbut does not know about her specific projects. Applicant\u2019s brother works as an electrical \nengineer for an automation company. They telephone each other on birthdays and see \neach other in person on Applicant\u2019s visits to China. Applicant last traveled to China in \n2014 using her U.S. passport. She has no immediate plans to return. (Tr. 49-53, 69-77, \n85-86; GE 1; AE O.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband also has family members who are citizens and residents of \nChina: three sisters, a brother-in-law, and a nephew. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) Applicant\u2019s sisters-in-\nlaw and brother-in-law are retired factory workers. The record is does not contain \ninformation on Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s contacts with his family members in China; \nhowever, each of his sisters has visited him and Applicant at their home in the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s contact with her three sisters-in-law (hereinafter referred to as SIL 1, \nSIL 2, and SIL 3) are limited to these visits. SIL1 has visited Applicant and her husband \nthree times, most recently in 2017. SIL 2 last visited Applicant\u2019s family in in 2018. \nApplicant does not have independent contact with SIL 2\u2019s husband and it is unclear if he \nhas traveled to the United States. SIL 2\u2019s daughter is a citizen of China, residing in the \nUnited States and married to a U.S. citizen. She has applied for U.S. citizenship. The \nniece and Applicant\u2019s husband work for the same financial services company. Applicant \nhas the most contact with SIL 3, whose son, also a citizen of China, lived with Applicant \nand her family while studying at a community college local to Applicant\u2019s home. He is \nnow a student at a U.S. university and lives on campus. He lives with Applicant when \ncampus is closed. SIL 3\u2019s most recent visit occurred in early 2019. Applicant\u2019s husband \nhas a second nephew who is a citizen and resident of China, but the record does not \ncontain any additional information about him. Applicant does not provide any financial \nsupport to these relatives. She does not speak with her brother or her husband\u2019s \nrelatives about her work. (Tr. 54-59, 66, 77-83, 100; GE 1; Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant does not have any financial interests in China, but has significant U.S-\nbased assets. They enjoy a household income over $350,000. They own their home \nand two rental properties, which have a total value of $1.6 million. Applicant has over \n$200,000 in short-term and retirement savings. In addition to her financial and familial \nties to the United States, Applicant is also active in her local community. She volunteers \nat her child\u2019s school. She also volunteers with youth-oriented STEM activities in her \ncommunity. (Tr. 44-46, 83, 88-91.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant presented the testimony of three character witnesses and several \nletters of support. She is described as a talented and hardworking scientist. Her \ncharacter references attest to her integrity and overall good character.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites  \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n\u201c[F]oreign contacts and interests, including . . . business, financial and property \ninterests, are a national security concern if they result in a divided allegiance [or] . . . \nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d An assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign interest is located, including \nbut not limited to, consideration such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or associated with a risk of terrorism.   \n \n \nChinese actors are the world\u2019s most active and persistent perpetrators of \neconomic espionage against the United States. In the defense industry, foreign-born \nengineers and scientists play a critical role in developing and implementing new \ntechnology and that technology may be of interest to others whose interests are \ncontrary to the United States. One method employed by the Chinese government relies \non the exploitation of Chinese nationals in research positions. The Chinese \ngovernment\u2019s poor human rights towards its citizens also has the potential to create a \nsource of vulnerability for Applicant. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s relationships and ongoing \ncontact with individuals who are residents and citizens of China creates a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.  (AG \u00b6 \n7(a).) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability also exists through her husband who has three sisters, a \nbrother-in-law, and a nephew who are residents and citizens of China. He also has a \nniece and a nephew who are Chinese citizens residing in the United States. Although \nthe record is largely silent on the extent of Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s contacts with his \nsiblings and their children, independent of Applicant, there is sufficient evidence to \nsuggest that the relationships are close given the frequent visits Applicant\u2019s sisters-in-\nlaw make to the U.S and time spent in Applicant\u2019s home. Evidence also suggests \nApplicant\u2019s husband likely has close relationships with his niece and nephew. \nApplicant\u2019s husband and his niece work for the same company and his nephew resides \nin Applicant\u2019s home.  \n \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, their immediate family members. See generally ISCR Case No. 01-03120, \n(App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). \u201c[A]s a matter of common sense and human experience, there \nis [also] a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, \nthe immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-17673 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 2, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002)). \nThis concept is the basis of AG \u00b6 7(e). Indirect influence from a spouse\u2019s relatives living \nin China result in a security concern. See ISCR Case No. 09-05812 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. \n1, 2011) (finding \u201cpresence in India of close family members, viewed in light of that \ncountry\u2019s troubles with terrorism and its human rights abuses, and his sharing living \nquarters with a person (his spouse) having foreign family contacts, establish the \n\u2018heightened risk\u2019\u201d in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(b) and 7(e)).  Given these facts, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections \nto a foreign person\u2026that create a potential conflict of interests between the individual\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individuals \ndesire to help a foreign person\u2026. By providing that information and technology,\u201d and \n7(e), \u201cshared living quarters with a person regardless of citizenship status, if that \nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nore coercion,\u201d also apply. \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes its prima facie case, the burden shifts to \nApplicant to present witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts he has admitted or those established by Department Counsel. Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  \n \n \nFor her part, Applicant has taken a number of affirmative steps to distance \nherself from the Chinese government, including presenting her Chinese passport to \nChinese immigration officers for destruction. Her son and two stepchildren are U.S. \ncitizens by birth. Applicant and her husband have accumulated significant U.S.-based \nfinancial assets. Although Applicant\u2019s ties to the United States are strong, a potential \nconflict of interests remains. Applicant\u2019s relationships with her parents and her in-laws, \nwhile infrequent, are not casual. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence in the record \nregarding the activities and positions of her relatives in China to support a finding that a \npotential conflict of interests is unlikely, or that the relationships are not a potential \nsource of foreign influence or exploitation. None of the foreign influence mitigating \nconditions apply.  \n \nIn reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d). As discussed above, Applicant has significant ties to the United States. She \nis talented, hardworking, and possesses good character and integrity. A finding that \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by her relationships with her \nChinese national relative does not suggest that Applicant is untrustworthy or unreliable. \nIt is not a finding that Applicant is unable to follow the rules regarding the proper \nhandling and safeguarding classified information. Stated otherwise, the Government \nneed not prove an applicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to \nclassified information.  Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts and \ncircumstances not under their control \u2013 such as having close relatives who are citizens \nor residents of foreign countries. (ISCR Case No.01-26893 at 8 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2002); See also Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527-28 (1988). Applicant\u2019s \nfamilial relationships with Chinese nationals present an unacceptable security risk given \nthe Chinese government\u2019s acts of espionage against the United States. Applicant \nshould not be placed in a position where she might be forced to choose between loyalty \nto the United States and a desire to assist her relatives living in China who might be \ncoerced entities operating in that country. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Preference  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.d.   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On November 27, 2018, Applicant timely submitted a \nresponse in which the allegations under Guideline G were admitted.   \n \nOn March 26, 2019, I was assigned the case. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 12, 2019, setting the hearing \nfor August 22, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered four documents, accepted without objection as exhibits \n(Exs.) 1-4, as well as one hearing exhibit, noted as Ex I.

He stated that he was drinking rum. (Tr. 35) \nHe had the bottle in his car when he was stopped. \n \n \n In December 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while under \nthe influence (DUI), driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol, driving a vehicle on a \nhighway at speed exceeding the limit and driving while under the influence per se DWI. \n(1.b) Applicant pled guilty to the merged charges and received probation before \njudgment. (GX 4, AX E) He was 22 and had recently graduated from college. (Tr. 36) \nHe was drinking at a bar. Applicant hired an attorney to represent him.  He had to \ncomplete an eight to ten week alcohol drug treatment program and paid a fine of about \n$1,000. (Tr. 39) Applicant recalls he had 32 hours of community service. (Tr. 40) \n \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI, driving on a \nhighway at speed exceeding the limit, DWI, and driving or attempting to drive a vehicle \nwhile under the influence of alcohol, per se. (1.a) He believes that night he was drinking \nbeer and had perhaps five beers. (Tr. 41) Applicant pled guilty to the fourth charge and \nreceived probation before judgment. (GX 2, 3) He received a 12-month probation, which \nended on December 21, 2018. (AX E, with attachments) Applicant attended a MADD \n(victim impact panel) in 2018. (AX D) He believes that night he was drinking beer and \nhad perhaps five beers. (Tr. 41) \n \n \nApplicant enrolled in and successfully completed a weekend intervention \nprogram for alcohol-related offenses in September 2017. (AX A) He received an intense \neducational/learning experience. He was subject to random urinalysis. It was \nrecommended that Applicant remain sober, attend a minimum of 2 AA-NA meetings \nweekly and complete a structured, aftercare outpatient program. (AX F) (AX A, with \nattachments) He successfully completed a 26-week after care program. (AX B, with \nattachments) The 2018 reports indicate that he made good progress, and was \ncompliant with rules and policies. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nApplicant accepted full responsibility for the actions in 2017 and 2004. He was \ndrinking at an establishment and made the irresponsible decision to drive himself home, \ninstead of opting for alternate safe transportation. (Answer) Applicant is remorseful and \nstated that he had been drinking beer and he was just over the legal limit. (Tr. 29) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has taken a hard look and an assessment of his \nrelationship with alcohol. He knew he had to take drastic steps to alter the course of his \nlife. He attended three to four AA meetings a week. He has an AA sponsor and a home \ngroup. He has made a commitment to never again place himself, or anyone else at risk \nfrom his drinking. He intends to maintain sobriety. (Answer) He stated that he does not \ndrink anymore. (Tr. 31) However, at the hearing, he stated he has not attended any AA \nmeetings lately. (Tr. 45) If Applicant goes to a bar, he drinks water. (Tr.50) His friends \nunderstand that he no longer drinks alcohol. (Tr. 51) \n \n \nSince 2017, Applicant has not had a drink. (Tr. 31) He realized after his \ninvolvement with AA and men\u2019s groups, combined with abstinence that he did have a \nproblem with alcohol. It was impacting his life and he needed to change. (Tr. 30) He \nsubmitted the monthly progress reports from the treatment sessions. Each one noted \nthat Applicant was in full compliance with the plan.   \n \n \nSince the September 2017 DWI, Applicant has had no additional brushes with \nthe law. He recognizes that his troubles were based on poor judgment that needed to \nbe improved. During counseling, he totally refrained from alcohol. He made a pledge to \nhimself to abstain from the use of alcohol in the future.  Applicant came to grips with \nalcohol use as a problem in his life. He has had two convictions in his entire adult life. \nHis employer supports him. He has never received an alcohol diagnosis. (Tr.46) \n \nApplicant presented a witness, who has known him for about five years and is \naware of the SOR alcohol allegations. (Tr. 14) He stated that Applicant is a supporting \nFSO who has technical competence and an ability to manage and supervise a team. \nThe witness, a managing partner of the company, stated that Applicant is trustworthy \nand reliable in his position. (Tr. 16) He has seen Applicant in a social environment (once \na quarter) during an extended period of time on numerous occasions. His observation is \n\u201c[he] never observed Applicant drinking that much and recently he has not seen \nApplicant drinking at all.\u201d (Tr.16) He observed that  Applicant was not drinking alcohol at \nthe Christmas party in 2018. (Tr. 18) Applicant voluntarily disclosed the DUI through the \nprocess. (Tr. 20) \n \nApplicant has a girlfriend who lives with him. She has three children. He believes \nhe has a responsibility to be a good role model for them. He spends a significant \namount of time with them. (Tr. 51) He has a new perspective concerning alcohol and it\u2019s \nimpact on the quality of his life. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe Alcohol Consumption guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:  \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nApplicant\u2019s three alcohol-related incidents in 2000, 2004, and 2017 resulted in \ntwo convictions, with probation and fines. The 2000 incident involved a fine. These \narrests demonstrate his excessive use of alcohol and related poor judgment. They, \ntherefore, establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline could potentially be mitigated \nby the following applicable factors:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment \nprogram along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations.  \n \nApplicant was cited three times for drinking and driving within a 17 year period, \nwith his last in September 2017. They were the result of attending activities where it \ncould be presumed alcohol would be imbibed, and predicted that driving home would \nconclude the evening. Applicant acknowledges his poor judgment and takes \nresponsibility for his actions. He has completed an alcohol and drug counseling \nprogram, an in-patient program, and probation. (AX A, B) \n \nApplicant stopped drinking in 2017. He has come to grips with alcohol \nconsumption as an issue impacting his life. He has a girlfriend who has three children \nand he wants to be a positive role model for them. A two-year  period free of drinking \nseems to be a reasonable period or benchmark upon which to best assess that \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nApplicant is in control of his abstinence from alcohol and capable of responsible \njudgment.  AG \u00b6 23(b, d) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under the two \napplicable guidelines in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s highly \ncredible testimony, background, age, behavioral changes, and subsequent maturation. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me assured that Applicant\u2019s past conduct will \nnot recur. I found him credible. He has support from his employer who has known him \nfor about five years.  He successfully completed various programs and attended AA \nmeetings. He has a commitment to remain sober for the sake of his life, his job, and \nothers. He has never had a security violation or alcohol incident at work. I have no \nquestions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance \nvis-\u00e0-vis alcohol consumption. The evidence persuades me that Applicant has matured \nsufficiently to comport his behavior with applicable laws and regulations. Consequently, \nI conclude alcohol consumption security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \n         Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nNoreen A.

He became a naturalized United States (U.S.) \ncitizen in March 2015. He has at least 13 foreign family members who are citizens and \nresidents of Kenya. From 2010 to 2017, he sent them financial support, a practice that \nhe intends to continue. Applicant has not mitigated the foreign influence guideline. \nEligibility for security clearance access is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 29, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (Item 4) to obtain security clearance required for a \nposition with a defense contractor. On December 19, 2017 and March 20, 2018, he \nprovided summary interviews (PSIs) (Item 5) to an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). After reviewing the results of a background security \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings \nrequired to issue a security clearance. On October 30, 2018, DOD issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security reasons under the foreign influence \nguideline (Guideline B). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, \n\n \n  2 \n \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs). The guidelines were made applicable to all individuals who require initial or \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive \nposition.  \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer to the SOR on December 6, 2018. He \nelected to have his case decided on a written record instead of a hearing. On April 4, \n2019, the Government sent Applicant a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) \ncontaining evidence in support of the allegations in the SOR. Applicant received the \nFORM on June 21, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nreceived no response to the FORM. DOHA assigned the case file to me on July 9, \n2019. \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \n \nOn the second page of Department Counsel\u2019s FORM, at \u201cIII. Important Notice to \nApplicant,\u201d Department Counsel advised Applicant that the two PSIs (Item 5) would be \nexcluded from evidence if he objected to the exhibits. Alternatively, Department Counsel \nadvised him that he could correct, update, or modify the exhibit to improve its clarity or \naccuracy. Applicant did not object, and the exhibit was admitted into evidence. See, \nE3.1.20., DOD Directive 5220.6, page 52.  \n \n \nItem 7 of the FORM contained four documents from the U.S. Department of \nState. Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of facts relating \nto Kenya. The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge \nand not subject to reasonable dispute.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges foreign influence by Applicant because his immediate family \nmembers are citizens and residents of Kenya (SOR 1.a-1.g). Applicant\u2019s ownership of a \nhome in Kenya (SOR 1.f) and the financial support he has provided to family members \nin Kenya, and will provide in the future (SOR 1.g), raises additional concerns under the \nforeign influence guideline. Applicant admitted all allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant, born in Kenya in 1979, is 40 years old and has been married since \nSeptember 2006. He has five children whose ages are 13, 10, 8, and 6 years of age \n(twins). In May 2006, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science from another \nAfrican country. In December 2015, he earned a master\u2019s degree in information \ntechnology from an American university. Applicant immigrated to the United States in \nDecember 2009. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in March 2015. His wife was born \n\n \n  3 \n \nin Kenya in 1981. She is also a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Item 4 at 4 at 7-18, 19-20, 26, \n67; Item 5 at 5; item 6 at 4-5) \n \nApplicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Kenya. He has both a U.S. passport \nand a Kenyan passport that is not scheduled to expire until January 2022. He has \nexpressed his intention to renounce his Kenyan citizenship, but is waiting for the U.S. \nGovernment or his security clearance sponsor to instruct him to carry out his intention. \nHe is unable to begin working as a linguist until his security clearance is approved. \nApplicant is currently working as a part-time taxi driver. From 2010 to September 2017, \nhe was employed as a business analyst for a business process company. He has never \nhad a security clearance. He has owned his American home since June 2017. (Item 4 at \n4 at 7-18, 19-20, 26, 67; Item 5 at 5; item 6 at 4-5) \n \n \nBefore immigrating to the United States in December 2009, Applicant lived with \nhis wife, a former Kenyan air force officer, on a Kenyan air force base from November \n2007 to about June 2008. His wife resigned honorably from the military and they moved \nto a location near the base until they immigrated to the United States in December \n2009. There is no indication in the record of his wife\u2019s military position or how long she \nwas in the military, or whether she receives a military pension. She currently is \nemployed as a para professional for a public school system. (Though the wife is \nunalleged in the SOR, evidence regarding her status will be presented under the whole-\nperson concept below.) (Item 4 at 4 at 7-18, 26, 67; Item 5 at 5; item 6 at 4-5, 16) \n \nApplicant stated that he and his wife send money to her mother (SOR 1.e) to \nhelp pay monthly bills. They send money to help her father (SOR 1.e) fix his farm \nmachines. (Item 5 at 7-8, 10)  \n \n \nSOR 1.a \u2013 Applicant has four brothers who are citizens and residents of Kenya. \nHis 39-year-old brother works in a hardware store. Applicant\u2019s 34-year-old brother is a \nKenyan government police officer, and guards diplomatic aircraft. Neither Applicant\u2019s \n23-year-old brother nor his 19-year-old brother have ever worked. The 34-year-old \nbrother is the only sibling affiliated with the Kenyan government or military. (Item 4 at \n34-47) \n \n \nSOR 1.b \u2013 Applicant has four sisters who are citizens and residents of Kenya. \nHis 36-year-old sister, his 32-year-old sister, and his 29-year-old sister are housewives. \nApplicant\u2019s 20-year-old sister is unemployed. None of his four sisters are affiliated with \nthe Kenyan government or military. (Item 4 at 37-41) \n \n \nSOR 1.c \u2013 Applicant\u2019s fifth brother, 26 years old, is a citizen of Kenya and a \nresident of Saudi Arabia where he is attending school. Applicant contacts all siblings \nabout once or twice a week through a cell phone application. (Item 4 at 44; Item 5 at 5-\n7) \n \n\n \n  4 \n \n \nSOR 1.d \u2013 Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law, 35 years old, is a citizen and resident of \nKenya. She is a housewife with no affiliation with the Kenyan government or military. \nApplicant has monthly contact with her. The mode of contact is not identified. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law, 44 years old, is a citizen and resident of Kenya. He is \na project officer for an international emergency and relief organization. Applicant has \nmonthly contact with him. The type of contact is not identified. (Item 6 at 5) \n \n \nSOR 1.e \u2013 Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, 67 years old and a citizen and resident of \nKenya, is a housewife with no affiliation with the Kenyan government or military. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, 72 years old, a citizen and resident of Kenya, is a self-\nemployed farmer with no ties to the Kenyan government or military. Applicant\u2019s contact \nwith both in-laws is monthly, though the kind of contact is not identified. (Item 6 at 4; \nDecember 2018 answer to SOR) \n \n \nSOR 1.f \u2013 Applicant owns a home in Kenya valued at approximately $30,000. His \nparents, living with Applicant as permanent residents of the U.S. since September 2017, \ndid not want to own the Kenyan home because of potential inheritance issues with \nApplicant\u2019s siblings on their death. Applicant, his parents, and his children use the home \ninstead of hotels for accommodations when they are in Kenya on vacation or while \nvisiting relatives. (Item 5 at 9; item 6 at 12; December 2018 answer to SOR)  \n \n \nSOR 1.g \u2013 Between 2010 and 2017, Applicant provided approximately $32,450 \nin financial support to his family who are citizen residents of Kenya. Applicant plans to \ncontinue with financial support in the future to at least 13 foreign family members. He \nprovides specific amounts of money to them to pay for their food, rent, medical bills, \nschooling, and emergencies. (Item 5 at 11-12; Item 6 at 10-12; December 2018 answer \nto SOR) \n \n \nApplicant indicated during his counterintelligence screening questionnaire \ninterview in November 2017 that he never served in a foreign military service. He never \nprovided material or financial support to any organization seeking to harm the United \nStates, and was never threatened with blackmail or pressure. He averred that he would \nnever betray the United States. (Item 6 at 5-15) \n \n \nSince immigrating to the United States in December 2009, Applicant traveled to \nKenya on five occasions. In 2015, he stayed in Kenya for four months visiting his \nparents who were ill. He made four shorter trips between February 2016 and September \n2017 to visit them.  \n \nAdministrative Notice - Kenya \n \n \nThe Kenyan republic has three branches of government: (1) a directly elected \npresident; (2) a two-tier legislature consisting of a Senate and a National Assembly; and \n\n \n  5 \n \n(3) a judiciary. The United States and Kenya have been partners in the global war on \nterrorism.  \n \nThe U.S. State Department advises extreme caution when traveling throughout \nKenya because of crime and terrorism. Terrorist acts could occur by assault, suicide \noperations, bomb and grenade attacks, or kidnappings. On March 29, 2018, the State \nDepartment provided an advisory not to travel in the Kenya-Somalia border region due \nto acts of terrorism committed by the al-Shabaab terrorist faction. There were 23 \nterrorist attacks in the country in 2017, resulting in 80 fatalities. The U.S. government \nreceives ongoing information about terrorism threats directed at U.S., Western, and \nKenyan entities.  \n \n \nHuman rights problems continue to plague Kenya. These issues manifest \nthemselves in unlawful and politically motivated killings, disappearances occurring \nunder force, torture, life-threatening prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, \nrestrictions on freedom of the press and assembly, and violence against women.  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, are applied together with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n\n \n  6 \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest.  \n \n \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do not \nautomatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth under \nAG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation. As set forth in AG \u00b6 7(b), connections to family members are only \ndisqualifying if they create a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s security \nduties and his desire to assist his foreign family members.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s regular contacts with his five brothers, his four sisters, his sister and \nbrother-in-law, and his father and mother-in-law, who are citizens and residents of \nKenya, create a heightened risk of foreign inducement and pressure. These foreign-\nfamily connections also create a potential conflict of interest for him. Applicant\u2019s 34-\nyear-old brother has a close connection to the Kenyan government because he is a \npolice officer responsible for guarding diplomatic aircraft. Applicant\u2019s relationships with \nall his foreign family members, to whom he provided $32,450 in financial support from \n2010 to 2017, and to whom he intends to provide future financial support, create a \ngreater potential for Applicant\u2019s ties to produce a heightened risk of foreign exploitation \nand a potential for conflict of interest. The evidence establishes security concerns under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). \n\n \n  7 \n \nThe security concerns created by Applicant\u2019s foreign family members are \nmagnified when evaluated with ongoing terrorist activity in Kenya. The U.S. State \nDepartment has issued repeated warnings of terrorism committed by groups both inside \nand outside Kenya directed against or affecting U.S. and Western interests.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s ownership of a home in Kenya valued at approximately $30,000, and \napparent intention to keep the home, triggers an additional heightened risk or personal \nconflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(f).  \n \n \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply to the facts of this case because Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers could place him in a compromising position of having to choose between the \ninterest of the relatives or the United States. Though eight of the nine siblings have no \naffiliation with the Kenya government, one of the brothers is a police officer for the \ngovernment of Kenya. In view of the level of terrorist activity in the country, I cannot rule \nout the possibility that Applicant\u2019s foreign family members, including his four in-laws, \ncould be threatened by insurgents or government operatives to a point where Applicant \nwould have to choose between the interests of his family members and the interests of \nthe United States.  \n \n \nApplicant receives partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). He entered the United \nStates in December 2009 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2015. His \n\n \n  8 \n \nwife is a naturalized U.S. citizen. His five children are U.S citizens. He has some ties to \nthe United States. He earned his master\u2019s degree from an American university. \nApplicant\u2019s only documented economic ties to the United States are his home that he \nhas owned since June 2017, and his longest employment as a business systems \nanalyst from 2010 to September 2017. There is no evidence that reveals the value of \nthe home. There is no other evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s financial assets, i.e., \nsavings or checking account, retirement account, stock portfolio, or investment fund, in \nthe United States. Overall, those connections to the United States do not outweigh his \nties to his foreign family members as is demonstrated by his continuing financial support \nfor them and frequent and recent visits to see them in Kenya. On balance, Applicant has \nnot submitted persuasive evidence that shows his connections and loyalty to the United \nStates is so strong that he would decide any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply because of the totality and regularity of Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts with his foreign family members. From 2010 to 2017, he provided over $32,000 \nto them. Given the frequency of the contacts between Applicant and his foreign family, \nthe contacts and communication cannot be considered casual or infrequent.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years. He married in September 2006. He, his wife, and five \nchildren are U.S. citizens. In 2006, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from a college in a \nneighboring African state. He earned a master\u2019s degree in December 2015 from an \nAmerican institution. \n \n \nThe evidence favoring Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is insufficient \nto overcome the evidence supporting denial of his eligibility. Applicant has 13 listed \nforeign family members who are citizens and residents of Kenya that he provides \nfinancial support. Apparently, Applicant intends to maintain ownership of his Kenyan \n\n \n  9 \n \nhome. Though Applicant\u2019s wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen, he shares a home with her. \nShe was an officer in the Kenyan air force and resigned sometime in 2009, then lived \nwith Applicant close to the air base before they immigrated to the United States. \nApplicant presented no evidence indicating her military job, how long she served, or \nwhether she receives some kind of pension for her service. Applicant provided no \nevidence of his wife\u2019s current employment in the school district. (SOR 1.e) Because \nApplicant and his wife provide financial support to her parents (SOR 1.e), foreign \ninsurgents or state operatives have an additional reason to apply pressure through one \nof those family members, including his wife, to Applicant making him disclose classified \ninformation or compromise his security clearance responsibilities to the United States in \nsome other fashion. Having weighed and balanced all the evidence under the specific \nconditions in light of the record as a whole, Applicant has not mitigated the lingering \nsecurity concerns arising from the foreign influence guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n_____________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 34 years old. He was born in Afghanistan. He entered the United States in 2008. He became a naturalized citizen in October 2013. In 1998, prior to immigrating to the United States, he moved with his father and brother from Afghanistan to Uzbekistan because his father feared for his family\u2019s safety. At that time, his mother and sisters moved to Iran where his mother\u2019s parents lived. Applicant lived in Uzbekistan with his father and brothers until their refugee status was approved in 2008.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n06/26/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence, and under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence, and Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 16, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) containing seven Items, and it was \nreceived by Applicant on March 27, 2019. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, provide \ndocumentary evidence, or object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and it is admitted into \nevidence. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned this case to me \non June 5, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel submitted Items 6 and 7, which requested that \nI take administrative notice of certain facts about Iran and Afghanistan. Applicant did not \nobject, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the requests that \nare supported by source documents from official U.S. Government publications that were \nprovided with the FORM. The facts are summarized in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. He denied the SOR \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. He was born in Afghanistan. He entered the United \nStates in 2008. He became a naturalized citizen in October 2013. In 1998, prior to \nimmigrating to the United States, he moved with his father and brother from Afghanistan \nto Uzbekistan because his father feared for his family\u2019s safety. At that time, his mother \nand sisters moved to Iran where his mother\u2019s parents lived. Applicant lived in Uzbekistan \nwith his father and brothers until their refugee status was approved in 2008. He lived with \nhis mother in Iran for approximately six months while awaiting refugee status. Applicant \nis unmarried and has no children. (Items 3, 4, 5) \n \n \nFrom December 2011 to June 2012, Applicant worked as an interpreter with U.S. \nforces in Afghanistan. Previous to this, he worked for federal contractors in the United \nStates, as a role player and cultural advisor with U.S. forces preparing for deployment to \nthe Middle East. From July 2012 to January 2018, he worked for a federal contractor as \nan interpreter. Applicant provided several certificates of appreciation and achievement \nfrom the military units he supported. (Item 2) \n \n \nAt the time Applicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) in \nFebruary 2018, his mother and two sisters were living in Iran. Applicant and his father \nand brother were living in the United States. His mother has since moved to the United \nStates and obtained a permanent resident card in August 2018. His sisters, who are \ncitizens of Afghanistan, have married and live in Iran with their families. During his March \n2018 background interview, Applicant stated that he had weekly telephone contact with \nhis sisters.   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Iran in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, to visit his \nfamily members living there. On each visit, Applicant obtained visas to enter Iran by the \nuse of his Afghanistan passport. He traveled back to the United States using his U.S. \npassport. He has a cousin with whom he maintains contact who is a citizen and resident \nof Afghanistan. On several occasions, Applicant used his cousin as an intermediary to \nsend money to his mother when she lived in Iran. He would send his cousin the money, \nand he would then transfer the money to Applicant\u2019s mother in Iran. (Item 4) \n \nIn his February 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that in the past seven years, he \nused marijuana. He stated: \u201cI used it as a recreation purpose on occasions.\u201d He noted he \nused it from January 2012 to November 2017. He further stated that he used it: \u201cOnce \nevery three months on average for a total approximate use of 15 times.\u201d Regarding his \nfuture intention to use a controlled substance, he said: \u201cI am planning to work as a \nContract Linguist directly working with the US military. Therefore, I decided to never use \nit again.\u201d (Item 3) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s February 2018 Counterintelligence Focused Security Screening \nQuestionnaire (CFSSQ), he was asked to describe his current and past drug usage. He \nresponded: \u201cMarijuana I used three months ago. I\u2019ve done it maybe 10 or 15 times in my \nlife.\u201d Applicant told the interviewer that he used marijuana with various acquaintances and \nco-workers. He said that he smoked marijuana with co-workers and role players in the \nUnited States at different job locations when he was a role player or interpreter. The \nmarijuana was provided by other role players or acquaintances. Applicant told the \ninterviewer that his last marijuana use was in approximately October 2017, and he did not \nintend to use it again. (Item 4) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s March 2018 background interview, he disclosed to the investigator \nthat in 2015 he began to smoke marijuana. He estimated he used it about 16 times for \nexperimental purposes. He said he used it with two friends that he met through mutual \nfriends and people he met through rotations he had with an employer. He disclosed he \nworked for this employer as an interpreter from July 2012 to January 2018. He used \nmarijuana either at his friend\u2019s house or at his own house. He told the investigator that he \ndid not intend to use it in the future because he wanted to get a job with a federal \ncontractor. (Items 3, 5) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied \u00b6 2.a, which alleged: \u201cYou used \nmarijuana from approximately January 2012 to January 2018.\u201d He stated in his response: \n\u201cI told the officer that was interviewing me that I have used marijuana only 3 times in my \nlife.\u201d (Item 2)1 \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for disqualifying \npurposes, but may be considered when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating \nconditions, and in the whole-person analysis.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAfghanistan \n \n \nThe United States Department of State\u2019s travel warning for Afghanistan remains in \neffect and it warns U.S. citizens against travel there because of continued instability and \nthreats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Travel is unsafe due to ongoing \nrisks of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, and armed rivalry \nbetween political and tribal groups, militant attacks, suicide bombings, and insurgent \nattacks. These attacks may also target Afghan and U.S. Government convoys and \ncompounds, foreign embassies, military installations, and other public areas.  \n \nExtremists associated with various Taliban networks, the Islamic State in Iraq and \nSyria (ISIS), and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the \ncountry. These terrorist groups routinely attack Afghan and coalition forces, and U.S. \ntargets with little regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties. Due to \nsecurity concerns, unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. Government employees and \ntheir family members is restricted and requires prior approval from the State Department.  \n \nAfghanistan continues to experience aggressive and coordinated attacks by \ndifferent terrorist groups. These groups remain active and were able to conduct a number \nof high-profile, mass-casualty attacks in Kabul against sectarian and Afghan government \ntargets. They continue to plan such attacks against U.S. and coalition forces and Afghan \ninterests. Border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan remain safe havens for terrorists. \nThe Afghan government struggles to assert control over this remote region.  \n \nAccording to a June 2017 U.S. Department of Defense report on Afghanistan, \nAfghanistan faces a continuing threat from as many as 20 insurgent and terrorist networks \npresent and operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, in what is the highest \nconcentration of extremist and terrorist groups in the world. \n \n \nThe State Department\u2019s report on human rights for Afghanistan notes there was \nwidespread violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and killings of persons \naffiliated with the government by armed insurgent groups, widespread disregard for the \nrule of law and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses. There \nwas also targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls.  \n \n \nAfghanistan remains an important partner of the United States in the fight against \nterrorism, working with the U.S. to eliminate terrorist groups. The U.S. Government \ncontinues to invest resources to help Afghanistan improve its security, governance, \ninstitutions, and economy. The U.S. Government has a strong bilateral partnership with \nthe Afghan government. (Item 7) \n \nIran \n \n \nIran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984. It remains \nthe most prominent state sponsor of terrorism, providing financial aid, advanced weapons \nand tactics, and direction to militant and terrorist groups across the Middle East. It \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncultivates operatives across the globe as a contingency to enable potential terrorist \nattacks.  \n \n \nIran uses terrorist groups to implement foreign policy goals, provide cover for \nintelligence operations, and create instability in the Middle East. It remains an enduring \nthreat to the U.S. national interests. Iran and its primary terrorism partners pose a \npersistent threat to the United States and its allies worldwide. The U.S. Government does \nnot have diplomatic ties or consular relations with Iran. The Department of State warns \nU.S. citizens not to travel to Iran due to the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention. \n \n \nIran continues to leverage cyber espionage, propaganda, and attacks to support \nits security priorities, influence events and foreign perceptions, and counter threats, \nincluding against U.S. allies in the region. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nhas identified several countries, including Iran as posing a significant cyber threat against \nthe United States. The DNI specifically noted that Iran will continue to penetrate U.S. and \nallied networks for espionage and to position itself for potential cyber-attacks. There is \nalso concern that Iran will expand its influence in the region and will develop military \ncapabilities that threaten U.S. forces.  \n \n \nIn 2015, the Visa Waiver Program was amended. Under the amendment, citizens \nof Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria are ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States. \nThe exclusion of these countries from waiver eligibility reflects: that the presence of an \nindividual from that country increases the likelihood that the individual is a credible threat \nto the national security of the United States: that a foreign terrorist organization has a \nsignificant presence in the country; or that the country is a safe haven for terrorists. \n \n \nIran has a poor human rights record. There are severe restrictions on civil liberties, \nincluding freedom of assembly, association, speech, religion, and the press. Other \nproblems include abuse of due process, combined with the use of capital punishment for \ncrimes that do not meet requirements for due process, as well as cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment and punishment; and disregard for the physical integrity of persons, \nwhom authorities arbitrarily and unlawfully detained, tortured, or killed. There are \nnumerous other human rights problems in Iran. (Item 6)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and two sisters are citizens of Afghanistan. His mother recently \nbecame a permanent resident of the United States. She previously lived in Iran. Applicant \nlived with her in Iran for six months while he was waiting for refugee status to immigrate \nto the United States. His sisters are citizens and residents of Iran. They are married and \nlive in Iran with their families. Applicant\u2019s cousin is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan. \nApplicant traveled to Afghanistan in 2011 and to Iran in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, \nand 2017 to visit his family living in those countries. He provided funds to his mother when \nshe lived in Iran and used his cousin as a financial intermediary. There is an articulated \nheightened risk associated with having ties to family members in Iran and Afghanistan \ndue to the activities of terrorist organizations and insurgents operating within their \nborders. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nNone of the above conditions are mitigating in this instance. Applicant maintained \ncontact with his family in Iran by visiting them in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. \nAlthough his mother recently moved to the United States, his sisters and their families \nremain in Iran. In his background interview, he said that he maintained weekly telephone \ncontact with his sisters in Iran. It is unknown if his contact has changed since his mother \nmoved to the United States. It is unknown if he or his mother plans to visit them in Iran. \nApplicant provided his mother financial support while she was living in Iran. Presumably, \nhe remains close with his mother. It is unknown whether she has influence over Applicant, \nor if she intends to visit her daughters in the future.  \n \nApplicant also maintained close and continuing contact with a cousin, who is a \ncitizen and resident of Afghanistan. He used his cousin to act an intermediary to send \nmoney to his mother in Iran. He no longer does that because his mother lives in the United \nStates. Applicant traveled to Afghanistan in 2011. I have considered Applicant\u2019s service \nas an interpreter for about seven months in Afghanistan in 2011-2012, and his \nemployment as a cultural advisor and role player in the United States. Due to Applicant\u2019s \nclose relationship with his family in Iran and Afghanistan, I cannot find his contact with \nfamily members living there is casual or infrequent. Applicant has traveled to Iran \nfrequently since immigrating to the United States in 2008. There is insufficient evidence \nto find that it is unlikely that Applicant would be placed in a position of choosing between \nhis family and the interests of the United States. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence of deep and longstanding connections to the United States, such as property \ninterests or other community ties. Without more information, it cannot be determined that \nApplicant would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA, CFSSQ, and during his background interview that \nhe used marijuana approximately 10 to 15 times from approximately January 2012 to \nOctober 2017. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \nBy his own admissions on three different occasions when responding to questions \nas part of the security clearance process, Applicant disclosed that his marijuana use \nbegan in 2012 and continued until October 2017. He stated he used it about 10-15 \noccasions during that time. He stopped using it because he wanted to obtain a job with a \ngovernment contractor. In his answer to the SOR, he denied the extent of his marijuana \nuse and stated that he used it three times in his life. He also disclosed that he used it with \nco-workers while acting as a role player. Under these circumstances, I cannot find that \nhis use was infrequent, happened under unique circumstances or does not cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nBased on his contradictory responses regarding the extent of his use of marijuana, \nI am unable to determine if Applicant is committed to refraining from future use. It is \nunknown if he has disassociated himself from drug-using associates and whether he has \navoided the environment where drugs were used. There is no evidence of completion of \n\n \n10 \n \n \na drug treatment program. Applicant\u2019s behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b) and 26(d) do not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since 2013. I \nhave considered that he worked for a U.S. contractor in Afghanistan for about seven \nmonths and worked in the United States as a role player and cultural advisor for the \nmilitary. I have considered Applicant\u2019s close ties to his sisters in Iran and his cousin in \nAfghanistan. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use over an extended period of time while he was \nworking as a role player raises concerns about his ability to comply with rules and \nregulations. Applicant provided insufficient evidence to meet his burden of persuasion. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant  \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He \ndid not mitigate the resulting financial security concerns. National security eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 31, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. Applicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on December 28, 2018, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nOn April 5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned \nthe case to me. On May 6, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for \nMay 28, 2019. The case was heard as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 into evidence. Applicant testified and offered \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A into evidence. All exhibits were admitted. At the end of the \nhearing, the record closed. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 5, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, with explanations. His \nadmissions are incorporated into these findings.  \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and single. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree that he earned in \n1983. He has worked for federal contractors since the 1980s and held security clearances \nduring some of that time. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, \nfor the past 11 months. Prior to this position, he worked for a different federal contractor \nfor a year and a half. He had been unemployed for a year and a half before he found that \nposition. He said that since September 11, 2001, he experienced several periods of \nunemployment that contributed to his financial difficulties. For example, since 2010 he \nhas been unemployed four to five times. In 2011, 2012, and 2015, he was unemployed \nfor eight months each year because he could not secure a federal contract. (Tr. 26-31, \n35-36)  \n \n \nIn October 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) for \nre-investigation and renewal. In December 2017, a government investigator interviewed \nhim about matters in his 2016 SCA, including delinquent debts and student loans. (GE 1, \nGE 2) \n \n \nApplicant testified that in 1994 he lost his security clearance for having delinquent \ndebts and student loans. He thinks he owed about $30,000 in student loans at the time. \nAfter entering into a rehabilitation plan and bringing the student loans into a current status, \nhis security clearance was reinstated in 1998. He said he originally took out about $40,000 \nto $50,000 in student loans to obtain his bachelor\u2019s degree in the early 1980s. He \nacknowledged that his current delinquent student loan balance includes some of those \nunpaid loans. He said he has been unable to pay them because he has experienced \nperiods of unemployment over the years. (Tr. 58-60, 66-69) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is about $100,000, which is approximately the same \namount he has received on most contracts throughout the past few years. He said he \ngenerally spends between three and six months locating a new work contract after he \ncompletes one. (Tr. 32, 37) His net monthly income is about $7,000, and his monthly \nexpenses are between $4,000 and $5,000. He has some money in a 401(k) retirement \naccount, but does not have a savings account. He consulted a financial counselor twice \nin the last six to eight months. He is working on a budget with the counselor. (Tr. 61, 69-\n72) \n  \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBRs) from July and August 2017, and August \n2018, the SOR alleged nine debts that became delinquent between 2013 and 2017, and \ntotaled $33,745. Applicant repeatedly stated that he was unaware of the debts until he \nreceived the SOR. (Tr. 55; GE 2, 3, and 5) The status of each debt is as follows: \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n1. (1.a) In October 2016, Applicant submitted a SCA. Prior to that, he had stopped \npaying his student loan debt for two or three years. In December 2017, he \ninitiated a loan-rehabilitation process and started making nominal payments of \n$5 a month for nine months. In September 2018, he completed that process \nand began making monthly payments of $150. The SOR listed the debt as \n$15,717; however, according to AE A, the total amount is $19,925, and includes \ntwo loans. Although he is now paying them again, he has not made sufficient \nprogress on reducing the debt, given the number of years he has failed to \naddress them. They are unresolved.(Tr. 37-44; GE 6; AE A)  \n \n  \n2. (1.b) The $14,926 unpaid debt owed to an apartment complex became \ndelinquent in 2013. It was settled for $5,224 and paid in November 2018. It is \nresolved. (Tr. 49; Answer: Ex. B)   \n \n3. (1.c) The $854 debt owed to a credit card company became delinquent in 2013 \nand was paid in 2018. It is resolved. (Tr. 52; Answer: Ex. C) \n \n4. (1.d) The $380 debt owed to a credit card company became delinquent in 2013 \nand was paid in November 2018. It is resolved. (Tr. 50; Answer Ex. D) \n \n5. (1.e) The $295 debt owed to a credit card company became delinquent in 2013 \nand was paid in November 2018. It is resolved. (Tr. 53; Answer: Ex. E) \n6. (1.f) The $94 debt owed to an insurance company is paid. (Tr. 53-54)  \n \n7. (1.g) The $675 debt owed to a credit union was paid in November 2018. It had \nbeen owed for five or six years. It is resolved. (Tr. 54; Answer: Ex. G) \n \n8. (1.h) The $637 debt owed to a cable company was paid in January 2018. It is \nresolved. (Answer: Ex. H) \n \n9. (1.i) The $167 debt owed to a cable company was paid in January 2018, along \nwith the debt listed in No. 8, above. It is resolved. (Tr. 56; Answer: Ex. H)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a partial credit report from May 2019. It indicates that he has \na credit score of 741. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out three disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nBased on his admissions and credit reports, Applicant accumulated nine delinquent \ndebts totaling over $34,000, which he did not begin to address until sometime in 2018, \nafter he completed his 2016 SCA or received the 2018 SOR. The record evidence \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). He has had sufficient income over the years to \nmaintain some amount of payment on his student loans, but has chosen to ignore the \nloans that he obtained for his bachelor\u2019s degree. The evidence establishes AG \u00b6 19(b). \n \nAG \u00b6 20 sets out four conditions that could potentially mitigate those financial \nsecurity concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent accounts in about 2013, which he did \nnot address until 2018, after he reapplied for a security clearance. He did not begin to \nresolve his delinquent $19,000 student loan debt until near the time he was interviewed \nabout his debts in December 2017. Given his history of failing to manage his debts and \nstudent loans, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that similar problems are likely to \nrecur, casting doubts as to his reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial delinquencies to sporadic periods of \nunemployment between contracts over the years. Those circumstances may have been \npartially beyond his control, but were regular and foreseeable consequences of his \nchosen profession. He did not establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) because he \nfailed to provide evidence that he responsibly managed his debts under those \ncircumstances. He was aware that delay in finding a new contract was expected, but he \nfailed to budget and plan for that expected event. Applicant stated he recently started \nparticipating in financial counseling and was working on a budget, but did not provide a \ncopy of that budget. He provided proof that he fully resolved eight of the nine debts by \nthe end of 2018, such that those debts are now under control. There is evidence to \nestablish some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c), as to all debts other than his student loans. \nIn December 2017, he took steps to rehabilitate his student loans through nominal \nmonthly payments. He had not made payments on these loans for two or three years \nprior to that. In November 2018, he began making monthly payments of $150 on the \nloans, which now total about $20,000. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that \nApplicant made a good-faith effort to resolve his student loans, based on the proximity \nof his financial actions and his request to renew his security clearance. The evidence \nestablishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d), as to his student loans. Whole-\nPerson Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an educated man who has worked for federal contractors since the \n1980s and held security clearances in the past. He also has a long history of failing to pay \nhis bills and student loans. In 1994, he lost his clearance because of unpaid debts and \ndelinquent student loans. He did not obtain another clearance for four years as a \nconsequence. In 2018, the DOD CAF initiated a second investigation based on his \ndelinquent debts and old student loans. He resolved most of the delinquent debts after \nhe received the SOR. He started addressing his student loan debt in December 2017, \naround the time of his interview. That debt totals almost $20,000 and has remained \nunresolved for many years, despite the fact that he previously lost his clearance for four \nyears for having delinquent loans and debts. The record evidence leaves me with serious \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s commitment to resolve his student loans, as well as his judgment \nand suitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate all of the security \nconcerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n    \n                     Against Applicant \n \n \n        Subparagraphs 1.b through 1.i: \n \n \n        For Applicant  \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to renew Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nSHARI DAM, Administrative Judge \n",

She saw a psychiatrist and attended about nine sessions with a licensed \nprofessional counselor (LPC). Her psychiatrist wrote a letter in February 2016 and \nstated that on examination, he \u201ccould confirm no psychiatric contraindication to \n                                                          \n1 Transcript (Tr.) at 25-27; GE 1; AE C. \n \n2 \n \nAE D. \n\n \n3 \n \n[Applicant] performing her job,\u201d and she was \u201creleased psychiatrically to return to work \nfull-time, without restriction.\u201d She returned to work in early March 2016.3  \n \nApplicant was evaluated at the DOD\u2019s request by a licensed psychologist in April \n2018. The psychologist wrote: \n \n[Applicant] struggles with the symptoms of a serious mental illness. She \nqualifies for a diagnosis of Schizophrenia, First Episode, currently in \npartial remission. Additionally, she qualifies for a diagnosis of Schizotypal \nPersonality Disorder. Her primary symptoms include bizarre delusions of \nreference and paranoia (she was being watched by eye-tracking software, \nher mood was monitored, and she was an unwilling participant in a \nresearch study; she developed delusions about \u201cblack projects\u201d funded by \nshadow budgets and staffed by people with aliases who were hidden by \n[Employer]) and auditory hallucinations (women talking about her, \ndiscussing her, conducting a commentary about her life). Her \nhallucinations are a classic auditory type hallucination in that they come \nfrom outside of her body (she identified a location), they were generally in \na fixed point of reference (she identified the source as an empty cubicle), \nthey were same-gender voices (women), and they were carrying on a \nrunning commentary that was consistent with her delusions and did not \ninteract with her. \n \nThe psychologist concluded:  \n \nReliability, Judgment, Stability, and Trustworthiness: Due to the \nnature of her mental illness and personality disorder, and due to her \ninconsistent level of insight and demonstrated ability to be evasive during \nan interview, it is my clinical and professional opinion that [Applicant\u2019s] \nSchizophrenia symptom potential and her ongoing Schizotypal Personality \nDisorder symptoms significantly impair her reliability, judgment, stability, \nand trustworthiness. It is clear that she has no specific malicious intent \nand she is most likely uninterested in any financial or personal gain that \ncould arise from violating her position of trust. However, when dealing with \nher delusions, and when in environments that activate distress related to \nher schizotypal features, she is at high risk for inappropriately using, \ndisclosing, or otherwise compromising classified or secure information or \nsystems. Although she presents as a sympathetic case, the risk posed by \nher mental illness and personality disorder cannot be ignored. \n \nThe prognosis was poor to guarded:  \n \nAlthough her symptoms are generally mild and controllable with effort, \nthey can be magnified to the moderate range, as indicated by the events \nof September 2015 to December 2015, especially if she is in an \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 22, 50-54, 58, 60; GE 1, 3; AE E. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nunfavorable or stressful environment. Even with her high level skills and \nadvanced technical education, there is no guarantee that she will not find \nherself in an environment she does not find favorable. If she does find \nherself transferred to such an environment (such as where she was with \n[defense project]) the likelihood of relapse is very high. This likelihood of \nrelapse is magnified by her refusal to get treatment or follow through with \nrecommendations for psychiatric care. \n \nThe psychologist opined that Applicant presented an unacceptable security risk. \nHowever, he also emphasized that \u201cno part of this report or recommendations should be \ntaken to indicate that [Applicant] is not an appropriate and trustworthy employee under \ntypical circumstances.\u201d He concluded that she \u201cshould be allowed to continue work in \nher current environment and there is no indication that she would not be an effective \nand productive employee in a non-classified military or Government environment.\u201d \n \nApplicant believes that she was targeted and monitored by cyber security at her \noffice, at a conference, in her car, and at home for about four to five months through \nearly 2016. She would overhear co-workers at work discussing what she did at home \nthe night before. She submitted evidence, and I find, that there is technology that can \nmonitor her in the way that she described.4 \n \nApplicant has not experienced direct evidence of the monitoring since early 2016. \nHowever, in July 2016, she recorded people in her apartment who were supposed to be \npest control. It was suspicious because there are three distinct voices, two females and \na male, on the recording, and an actual pest control person had come by earlier in the \nday. She also indicated that the apartment complex had three maintenance workers \nwho were all male. Applicant played the recording at the hearing, and her description of \nthe voices is accurate. She did not ask the apartment complex if additional maintenance \nworkers were in her apartment. Instead, she reported it to the FBI in September 2016. \nShe never heard anything back from the FBI. She does not know if she has continued to \nbe monitored without her knowledge. She moved to a house, which has more privacy \nthan an apartment.5  \n \nApplicant disagrees with the psychological evaluation. She asserted that there is \ninformation in the evaluation that is inaccurate, and she is quoted with statements that \nshe never said. She is not resistant to treatment if she felt it necessary, but she does \nnot believe it is necessary.6 \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 22-29, 37, 44-50, 53-56, 65-68; AE A, B. \n \n5 Tr. at 30-36, 58-60. \n \n6 Tr. at 22, 38-43, 63-65, 70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may \nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.  \n \nThe psychologist opined that Applicant \u201cqualifies for a diagnosis of \nSchizophrenia, First Episode, currently in partial remission . . . [and] Schizotypal \nPersonality Disorder.\u201d He concluded that her \u201csymptoms significantly impair her \nreliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness.\u201d AG \u00b6 28(b) is applicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \nApplicant is an honest, intelligent woman who believes that she was targeted and \nmonitored by cyber security at her office, at a conference, in her car, and at home for \nabout four to five months through early 2016. She believes co-workers would discuss \nwhat she did at home the night before. If the monitoring did not occur, she is suffering \nfrom delusions that significantly impair her judgment, reliability, and ability to properly \nsafeguard classified information. Based on the record, Applicant\u2019s testimony, my \nobservation of her demeanor, and the nature of her assertions, I find that Applicant has \nnot rebutted the findings in the psychological evaluation. None of the above mitigating \nconditions, individually or collectively, are sufficient to alleviate psychological conditions \nsecurity concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nI was very impressed by Applicant. I believe that but for her psychological issues, \nshe would be a valued employee without any security concerns. However, the \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. It is required that \n\u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will \nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d I agree with the psychologist that Applicant \npresented an unacceptable security risk, but I also agree that there is no indication that \nshe is not an appropriate and trustworthy employee under typical circumstances or that \nshe would not be an effective and productive employee in a non-classified environment. \n\n \n8 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the psychological conditions security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

He failed to provide sufficient \nevidence to explain why he was unable to pay or otherwise resolve the delinquent \nobligation listed in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). Additionally, he used marijuana after \nbeing granted a security clearance in 2013. Financial considerations and personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 14, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, under which it \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him.  \n\n \n2 \n \nThe DoD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn December 14, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA).

He admitted \nbeing charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), and admitted that he drank a lot after \nhe left the military, but denied admitting during a 2015 substance abuse evaluation that \nhe had a drinking problem, and denied the marijuana allegations. After a thorough review \nof the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old technical support associate who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since June 2005 and seeks to retain a security clearance. In 2013, he \nwas granted a secret security clearance. (Ex. 3, Tr. 62) He was also granted a security \nclearance in the 1990s. (Ex. 4) He is married, and has three children ages 25, 21, and \n17.

(Ex. 1) He served in Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, \nand Bahrain. (Tr. 32) From October 1990 to April 1991, he was deployed for seven \nmonths in support of Operation Desert Storm. (Ex. 2) Desert Storm started on August 2, \n1990 and ended February 28, 1991. He was also deployed to Kuwait for three and a half \nmonths from May 2002 through August 2002 in the Liberation of Kuwait campaign. (Ex. \n1, Ex. 2) His unit deployed again, but he did not go since the deployment started three \ndays after his expiration term of service (ETS) date. (Tr. 34) In 2008 or 2009, he was \ndiagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD). (Ex. 3, Ex. 5) He says \nhe went to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for help, but stopped going to \nthe VA a few years ago. (Tr. 52) He does not receive any VA disability compensation. (Tr. \n80) \n\n \n3 \nWhen Applicant completed his March 2017 Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP), he indicated he had two delinquent obligations of $428 \nand $103. He also listed a delinquent $1,800 student loan and stated he was currently in \nthe process of establishing a monthly $250 automatic draft to pay the student loan \nobligation. (Ex. 1)  \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2018 Enhanced Subject Interview, he stated he drank \nheavily after work every other day and on most weekends while on active duty until 1993. \n(Ex. 3) He indicated his consumption of alcohol increased after his deployment during \nDesert Storm as he would drink to escape the feeling that being in active combat invoked. \n(Ex. 3) After leaving the Army, he would drink three or four beers and a couple of shots \nof hard liquor two times a week. In 2004/2005, he stopped drinking beer and started \ndrinking red wine. (Ex. 3) \nApplicant stated he first used marijuana in 1992, the night before his deployment \nto Kuwait in hopes a positive urinalysis would prevent his deployment overseas. (Ex. 3, \nTr. 20) There was no urinalysis before his deployed. He did not smoke marijuana during \nhis deployment, but did some two or three times a year until 1997/1998. (Ex. 3) At the \nhearing, he said he only used marijuana one time, the night before his deployment to \nKuwait. (Tr. 33) During the hearing he stated that after leaving the Army his marijuana \nuse \u201cwas pretty regularly, pretty regularly when I got out. It was, I wouldn\u2019t say every day, \nbut it was a lot more than what I \u2013 my consumption when I was in the military.\u201d (Tr. 34) \nApplicant asserted he started using marijuana less after his children were born in \n1993 and 1998. (Tr. 35) At the hearing he asserted his last use of marijuana was in the \nlate 1990s. (Tr. 36) In his January 2018 interview, he stated he had not used marijuana \nsince 1997/1998. (Ex. 3) \n \nA November 2015 Substance Abuse Evaluation stated Applicant met the criteria \nfor alcohol abuse. (Tr. 4) In the alcohol/drug history portion of the evaluation it stated: \n \nWhile in the Army on active duty he drank almost every day until drunk or \nbuzzed in order to forget. In his mid-30s he drank 6 beers on 4 nights a \nweek. In his 40s (since 2010) until his DWI arrest he drank 3-4 times a week, \nusually 2-3 shots during the week and up to 4 shots on weekends. He mostly \nstopped drinking beer 3 years ago. In the past 5 years he recalls getting \ndrunk once a month and has experienced a few blackouts. He last drank in \nSeptember 2015.  \n \nHe began smoking marijuana at 15 and said he quit in August of this year. \nAt the peak of his pot smoking he was smoking daily \u201cin spurts.\u201d In 2015 he \nsaid he got high 10-20 times. \n \nIn the past year [Applicant] has noticed that he has been drinking too much \nbecause of anger and frustration with his life. He said he drinks and smokes \nto forget and to help him deal \u201cwith stuff.\u201d (Ex. 4)  \n \n\n \n4 \nIn the Patient\u2019s Report section of the evaluation, it states Applicant admits to \nhaving a drinking problem, but not a drug problem. (Ex. 4) The evaluation stated Applicant \nwas suffering from PTSD as a result of his military service in Desert Storm. He suffered \nfrom flashbacks and nightmares, experienced depression, anxiety, and hyper-vigilance. \n(Ex. 4) In response to the evaluation stating that Applicant quit smoking marijuana in \nAugust 2015, he stated, \u201cThe truth is that I stated I have used marijuana before, and I \nused to get high quite often when I first got out of the military, but I no longer use it.\u201d (Ex. \n4, Tr. 39) His response never specifically denied he stated he quit using marijuana as of \nAugust 2015. A month after the evaluation, marijuana was found in the vehicle he was \ndriving. (Tr. 43)  \n \nIn September 2015, Applicant attended a family party over the Labor Day \nweekend. He arrived at the party at 5:00 p.m. and over the course of six or seven hours \nconsumed two or three shots of tequila and \u201ca couple of beers.\u201d Later at 1:42 a.m. when \nstopped by the police his blood alcohol content (BAC) was above .15. (Ex. 3, Tr. 26)  \n \nWhen the party ended, Applicant felt his daughter was not able to drive herself \nhome, so he did. (Ex. 6) After dropping her at her home he continued onto his home. He \nasserted he was attempting to roll up the passenger-side window when he ran into the \ncurb. He was stopped by the police. He refused a breathalyzer test and was taken into \ncustody and charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) of alcohol. (Ex. 3) He said \nthat he had a couple of beers and a couple of mixed drinks at the family event. In a search \nof the vehicle, a small bag of marijuana was found between the seats. He was charged \nwith possession of marijuana, but the charge was later dismissed. (Ex. 3)  \n \nApplicant paid his attorney $5,000. (Tr. 28) Applicant was found guilty of DUI with \na BAC greater than .15, fined $2,457, and required to complete 21 months of supervised \nprobation, which ended in July 2017. (Ex. 4, Ex. 6) Following the completion of his \nsupervised probation, he was required to pay a $1,000 surcharge each year for three \nyears to the Department of Public Safety. He was also required to complete 80 hours of \ncommunity service, which he did at an animal shelter. (Tr. 29) He completed the \ncommunity service in December 2015 and January 2016. (Ex. F)  \n \nApplicant was required to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving class and \nordered to have a Substance Abuse Evaluation. (Ex. 3) In October 2015, he attended \nnine Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. (Ex. D) In October 2015, he completed a court \nrequired DWI Education Program. (Ex. F) He had a smart start interlock device installed \non his vehicle and was required to pay $75 monthly for the 21 months the device was on \nhis vehicle. (Ex. 3) Applicant believes the arrest cost him approximately $25,000. (Ex. 3) \nHe asserts he has reduced his alcohol consumption, but continues to consume alcohol \non weekends. (Tr. 35)  \n \nOn January 5, 2016, Applicant\u2019s son was suspended from school for three days \nafter coming to basketball practice smelling of marijuana. A search of his person \ndiscovered two marijuana buds. (Ex. A) Applicant believes the marijuana discovered \n\n \n5 \nduring his DUI stop belonged to his son. (Ex. 3, Tr. 43) When asked, his son denied it \nwas his or that of his friends. (Tr. 31)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 25, 2018 response to written interrogatories, he says he was \nlast intoxicated in July 2018, the month he completed his response. (Ex. 4) In his \nresponse, he stated he had been informed he met the criteria for alcohol abuse and was \nrecommended to complete counseling and continued with individual therapy. (Ex. 4)  \n \nFrom June 2018 through August 2018, Applicant had eight appointments with a \ndoctor to address anxiety and PTSD. (Ex. B, Ex. 5) Applicant attended all scheduled \nsessions and successfully achieved all of his goals. (Ex. B, Ex. 5) On September 13, \n2018, his doctor indicated Applicant\u2019s prognosis was \u201cMost favorable.\u201d (Ex. B, Ex. 5) \n \nApplicant was also approved for eight sessions of counseling or treatment from \nMay 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). \n(Ex. C) It is noted that the period of treatment has not ended. No information was received \nconcerning the nature of the sessions or what benefit he has received from the sessions. \nHe currently takes medication for depression, PTSD, and anxiety. (Tr. 54)  \n \nIn June 2010, Applicant and his wife purchased an automobile for approximately \n$25,537 with $583 monthly payments. (Ex. 2, Ex. 7) His wife was to make the monthly \npayments, but failed to do so in a timely manner. In June 2011, $22,441 was past due \nwhen they surrendered the car. (Ex. 6) In September 2009, following the repossession, \n$15,149 was charged off on the vehicle. (Ex. 2) When asked about the debt during his \nJanuary 2018 subject interview, he agreed with the delinquent account, but was unsure \nof the balance. (Ex. 3) His position on the delinquent debt was that since he no longer \nhad the vehicle he had no reason to pay the debt. (Ex. 3, Tr. 59)  \n \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had done nothing to address the delinquent \nobligation. (Tr. 61) He asserted that following the hearing, he would contact the creditor \nand take care of the debt. (Tr. 62, 64) No information or documentation concerning \ndiscussions with the creditor or payment on the debt was received following the hearing. \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s November 2013 subject interview, he indicated he was laid off \nfrom his job for three months from January 2004 through March 2004, and his wife was \nlaid off from her job in early 2004. (Ex. 2) His mortgage became delinquent and the house \nwent to foreclosure in 2005 or 2006. (Ex. 2) In his January 2018 subject interview, he \nstated the vehicle repossession was due to his wife losing her job and he was recovering \nfrom a layoff. However, the only evidence produced at the hearing indicates his wife lost \nher job in 2004, and he was laid off in 2004. As listed on his September 2013 security \nclearance application, his only period of unemployment between July 2000 and \nSeptember 2013 was during the first three months of 2004. The vehicle was purchased \nsix years later, in June 2010. \n \n\n \n6 \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues may have been contributed to by a $400 per month \ngarnishment commenced in 1998. The garnishment was for child support for his daughter. \nThe child support ended in 2011, when his daughter graduated from high school. (Ex. 2) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n7 \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n  \nThe record having established disqualifying conditions, additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Applicant has the burden of \nestablishing that matters in mitigation apply. Five financial considerations mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n\n \n8 \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant purchased a vehicle in June 2010 and voluntarily surrendered it. He \nasserted he was unable to make the monthly payments because he had been laid off and \nhis wife had lost her job. However, both of those events occurred in 2004, six years before \nthe car was purchased. Once the vehicle was repossessed and resold, Applicant owed \n$15,149. He acknowledged the debt, but was unsure of the balance owed on the vehicle. \nHe stated he did not want to pay the delinquent obligation because he no longer owned \nthe car. He said he would contact the creditor and address the debt. No documentation \nshowing this occurred has been received.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because the debt remains unpaid and there is no \nshowing it occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply because Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s job losses occurred six years before they \npurchased the vehicle.  \n \nAn applicant is not required to establish that he has paid the delinquent debt in the \nSOR. However, an applicant needs to show that he has a plan to resolve this debt and \nthat he has taken significant steps to implement his plan. Applicant was questioned about \nthe debt during his November 2013 interview, during his January 2018 interview, and it \nwas listed in his November 2018 SOR. At the hearing, he stated he intends to contact the \ncreditor and pay the debt. A promise to pay a debt at some future date is not a substitute \nfor a track record of timely payments. See ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. \n19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). There is no \nevidence of financial counseling or a good-faith effort to repay the debt. Without \n\n \n9 \ndocumented progress toward resolving the debt in the SOR, neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 \n20(d) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant acknowledged the debt. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Under all of these circumstances, Applicant failed to establish \nthat financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nConcerning the Government\u2019s case for disqualification under the personal conduct \nguideline because of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use continued until 2015, the Appeal Board \nhas held that security-related conduct can be considered under more than one guideline, \nand in an appropriate case, be given independent weight under each. See ISCR Case \nNo. 11-06672 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2012). Applicant exercised \u201cquestionable judgment\u201d within \nthe general security concerns set forth in AG \u00b6 15 when he used marijuana while holding \na security clearance, which he received in 2013. Separate from the risk of physiological \nimpairment associated with the use of a mood-altering substance, Applicant had an \nobligation as a clearance holder to comply with federal law prohibiting marijuana use. AG \n\u00b6 16(d) provides:  \n  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself of an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . .  \n  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \nThe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum concerning adherence to federal laws prohibiting marijuana use. In doing \nso, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state can authorize violations of federal \nlaw, including violations of the Controlled Substances Act, which identifies marijuana as \na Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state laws (and the laws of the District \nof Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the national security adjudicative \n\n \n10 \nguidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law concerning the use, sale, or \nmanufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making eligibility decisions for sensitive \nnational security positions. \n \n \nIt is difficult to believe that Applicant did not know that marijuana possession and \nuse was and continues to be illegal under U.S. federal law, not only given his age, level \nof education, and experience, which includes his employment with a defense contractor \nwith a security clearance for six years. Nothing about the circumstances of his \nrecreational marijuana use mitigates or justifies his noncompliance with federal law and \nthe requirements of his security clearance eligibility.  \n \nAlthough Applicant asserts he last used marijuana in the late 1990s, the November \n2015 Substance Abuse Evaluation stated Applicant said he had stopped using marijuana \nthree months prior the evaluation, in August 2015. The evaluation also stated Applicant \ngot high 10 to 20 times in 2015. He used marijuana after receiving a clearance in the \n1990s and after he received a clearance again in 2013. At times, he was using marijuana \ndaily. I find Applicant self-serving statement that the stopped using marijuana in the 1990s \nto be lacking in credibility. A statement made during a medical evaluation tends to be \nmore reliable and credible because the person making the statement is motivated to \nprovide accurate information to the treatment provider to ensure proper medical treatment \nis received. \n \nThe November 2015 Substance Abuse Evaluation stated Applicant met the criteria \nfor alcohol abuse. In the evaluation, he admitted having a drinking problem, but not a drug \nproblem. At the hearing, he stated he no longer believes he has a drinking problem. While \nin the Army on active duty he drank almost every day until drunk or buzzed in order to \nforget. In his mid-30s he drank six beers on four nights a week. In his 40s, from 2010 until \nhis September 2015 DUI, he drank three to four times a week. As of November 2015, he \nrecalled getting drunk once a month during the previous past five years and that he had \nexperienced a few blackouts. Applicant\u2019s July 25, 2018 response to written \ninterrogatories, he says he was last intoxicated in July 2018, the month he completed his \nresponse.  \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s September 2015 DUI, he asserted that he over the course of six \nor seven hours he consumed two or three shots of tequila and \u201ca couple of beers.\u201d I find \nthis assertion to lack credibility in that at 1:42 a.m. when stopped by the police, his BAC \nwas above .15. It is not possible for three shots of alcohol and two beers over the course \nof six or seven hours to result in such a high BAC, unless the beers had high alcohol \ncontent and a very large volume. He still consumes alcohol, but asserted he had reduced \nhis consumption.  \n \nApplicant has had no criminal alcohol-related involvement in four years. The record \ndoes not contain any other alcohol-related incidents away from at work or away from \nwork. However, there are indications of habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the \npoint of impaired judgment since his DUI arrest. He admitted he was intoxicated in July \n2018, approximately nine months before the hearing. Additionally, he met the criteria for \nalcohol abuse and it was recommended he continue individual counseling. He has \n\n \n11 \nreceived counseling and has been authorized to continue counseling through the end of \n2019. The record is silent as to the nature of the counseling or the benefits Applicant has \nreceived from the counseling. He followed all court orders following his DUI. With his last \nintoxication in July 2018 and the diagnoses of alcohol abuse, it is too soon to conclude \nalcohol consumption is no longer a problems. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F and Guideline E are \nincorporated in the whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable service to the U.S. Army from July 1989 \nthrough July 1993, his deployment during Desert Storm in 1990 and 1991, and his \ndeployment to Kuwait in 2002. Appellant deployments to qualified hazardous duty areas \nentitling him to receive hostile fire pay or imminent danger pay. His military service in \nharm\u2019s way in support of the United States military merits considerable respect. However, \nhis service does not mitigate the financial consideration and personal conduct security \nconcerns.  \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant did not \nprovide any evidence of payments, payment plans, or other actions to resolve the \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s actions show a lack of financial \nresponsibility and raise unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. He was questioned about the delinquent obligation \nduring his 2013 interview, during his January 2018 interview, and in his November 2018 \nSOR. The debt remains unpaid and there is no documentation that he has contacted the \n\n \n12 \ncreditor. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \nThe record shows questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations for his use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. To conclude, \nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security \nconcerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nclearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due \nconsideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision.  \n \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid\u2014it is \nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s fitness to hold a \nsecurity clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Additionally, his use of marijuana while holding a \nclearance is of concern. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts about his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

Henderson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding personal conduct and \nalcohol consumption. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 18, 1996, June 12, 2003, and again on April 8, 2016, Applicant \napplied for a security clearance and submitted either Questionnaires for National Security \nPositions (QNSP) or a Security Clearance Application (SCA). On April 6, 2017, she \nsubmitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of \na Security Clearance Application. On a subsequent date, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories. She responded to those \ninterrogatories on December 15, 2018. On January 30, 2019, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto her, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD \n4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines  (AG) (December 10, 2016) for all covered \n10/02/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and \nG (Alcohol Consumption), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a notarized statement, dated May 9, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on June 10, 2019, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days, \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM on July 23, 2019. Her \nresponse was due on August 22, 2019. Applicant chose not to submit any other \ndocuments. The case was assigned to me on September 24, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most, or portions thereof, of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., and 1.f.); as \nwell as most, or portions thereof, of the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol \nconsumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and accompanying \ncomments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a system engineer with her current employer since January 2008. She received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in November 1996, and \nserved until April 2004, when she was honorably discharged. Applicant was granted a top \nsecret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 1997, and \nthat clearance remained active until another U.S. Government agency denied Applicant\u2019s \naccess to SCI in March 2017, following an initial decision in December 2016. (Item 2, at \n31-33; Item 8, at 2; Item 10; Item 11) Applicant was married in late 2000, and divorced \nthree months later in 2001.She married again in 2004, and divorced in 2014. She has \nbeen cohabiting since the summer of 2017. (Item 2, at 17-18; Item 7 (2017 Enhanced \nSubject Interview, at 3); Item 7 (2018 Enhanced Subject Interview, at 4) She has no \nchildren.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose primary substances of \nchoice were marijuana, cocaine, and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) \u2013 a \npsychoactive drug commonly known as ecstasy. She also used Vicodin \u2013 a prescription \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \ncombination of an opioid pain reliever, hydrocodone, and a non-opioid pain reliever, \nacetaminophen, that was not prescribed for her.  In addition, although not alleged in the \nSOR, prior to joining the U.S. Army in 1996, Applicant also experimented with a variety \nof illegal substances, including those identified above. (Item 1, at 3; Item 8, at 2) \n \nApplicant is not a reliable historian regarding her history of drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse because of her inconsistent and frequently false statements in which \nshe either denied, concealed, or omitted significant portions of her history. In August \n1997, she denied ever using any illegal drug when she was a teenager, and she explained \nthat, because her parents believed she was using drugs, they enrolled her in a treatment \nfacility where she underwent group and individual counseling for two and one-half \nmonths.  She stated that she omitted the information from her QNSP because she did not \nfeel it was pertinent to the U.S. Army to know. (Item 6; Item 3) In June 2003, she again \ndenied any use of illegal substances or drug activity. (Item 4) In January 2015, Applicant \nagain denied any past illegal use of drugs or drug activity. (Item 5) In April 2017, when \ncompleting her e-QIP, she reported that she had used her husband\u2019s Vicodin prescription \nboth \u201coccasionally\u201d and \u201ca few times,\u201d but denied any other past illegal use of drugs or \ndrug activity. (Item 2, at 29-31) \n \nIn April 2016, prior to undergoing a polygraph examination, Applicant \nacknowledged that, from 2006 until 2008, she experimented with marijuana, and from \nApril 2009 until the beginning of 2013, she used her husband\u2019s medical marijuana from a \nvaporizer on no more than ten occasions. The marijuana relaxed her. (Item 8, at 2; Item \n9, at 2) In August 2018, during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM), Applicant initially denied using any controlled substance \nwithin the last seven years (2011-2018). Upon being confronted with her pre-polygraph \nstatement, she denied the accuracy of that earlier statement and explained that she was \ntold by the examiner that she had to discuss possible dates of drug use so she expanded \nher period of use. She claimed the correct period of use should have been from 2009 until \nmid-2010, and that she only did so on five occasions, when she used a vape pipe four \ntimes and one-half of a \u201cmarijuana sucker\u201d one time at home. (Item 7, at 3-4; Item 1 \n(Answer to the SOR), at 4) In her 2018 response to the interrogatories, Applicant \ncontended that her use of marijuana consisted of five times between 1996 and 2010, and \nthereafter of less than 30 instances. (Item 7 (Response to Interrogatories), at 4) Since \nApplicant was granted her top secret clearance with SCI access in 1997, her use of \nmarijuana occurred while she held her security clearance. \n \nDuring her 2016 pre-polygraph examination, Applicant acknowledged that, from \nApril 2009 until October 2013, she used Vicodin on no more than 20 occasions, each time \ntaking no more than three pills by mouth. She did so because of the euphoric effect she \nexperienced and in an effort to get high. (Item 8, at 2; Item 9, at 2) Her story changed \nduring her two OPM interviews. In 2017, she told the investigator that her Vicodin use \noccurred only between October 2011 and April 2012 when she was experiencing migraine \nheadaches. (Item 7 (2017), at 3) The story changed again in 2018. She told the OPM \ninvestigator that the correct dates of Vicodin use occurred between 2009 and mid-2010, \nand consisted of her taking three pills each time on only ten occasions. Vicodin made \nApplicant feel good. (Item 7 (2018), at 3) Since Applicant was granted her top secret \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nclearance with SCI access in 1997, her use of Vicodin without a prescription occurred \nwhile she held her security clearance. \n \nDuring her 2016 pre-polygraph examination, Applicant acknowledged that, before \njoining the U.S. Army in 1996, as well as from about 2006 until about 2008, she \u201ccontinued \nto experiment\u201d with ecstasy. (Item 8, at 2; Item 9, at 2) Her story changed during her 2018 \nOPM interview, when she avoided discussing any pre-Army use of ecstasy, and \nseemingly altered the previously acknowledged time period of 2006 to 2008 to \u201cit could \nhave been sometime\u201d during that period when she experimented with only one ecstasy \npill. (Item 7, at 5) In her 2018 response to the interrogatories, Applicant contended that \nher use of ecstasy consisted of one time between 1996 and 2006, and thereafter only two \ninstances. (Item 7 (Response to Interrogatories), at 4) Since Applicant was granted her \ntop secret clearance with SCI access in 1997, her use of ecstasy occurred while she held \nher security clearance. \n \nDuring her 2016 pre-polygraph examination, Applicant acknowledged that, before \njoining the U.S. Army in 1996, as well as from about 2006 until about 2008, she \u201ccontinued \nto experiment\u201d with cocaine. (Item 8, at 2; Item 9, at 2) Her story changed during her 2018 \nOPM interview, when she avoided discussing any pre-Army use of cocaine, and she \nacknowledged that her \u201cone-time\u201d experimentation with cocaine occurred in \napproximately 2006 or 2007 when a friend furnished it to her. (Item 7 (2018) In her 2018 \nresponse to the interrogatories, Applicant contended that her use of cocaine consisted of \none time between 1996 and 2007, and thereafter only two instances. (Item 7 (Response \nto Interrogatories), at 4) Since Applicant was granted her top secret clearance with SCI \naccess in 1997, her use of cocaine occurred while she held her security clearance. \n \nApplicant acknowledged that she was aware of the policy involving drug use while \nmaintaining a security clearance. She justified her drug use by thinking it was not a big \ndeal and that it was similar to drinking alcohol. Moreover, using the drugs was fun, and \nshe was just enjoying herself (Item 9, at 2) She subsequently claimed that she altered her \nthinking, and, as of 2018, she understands that her position was not correct. ((Item 7 \n(2018), at 5) As of her 2017 OPM interview, Applicant has no intent of using any illegal \ndrug in the future. (Item 7 (2017), at 4) \n  \nWhile not alleged in the SOR, when Applicant submitted her 1996 and 2015 \nQNSPs and her 2003 SCA, she denied any history of illegal use of drugs or drug activity. \nShe also had to be prompted and confronted to be candid during her pre-polygraph \ninterview and her OPM interview.  \n \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n(App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unalleged omissions, concealments, \nand falsifications regarding her history of drug involvement and substance misuse \ndescribed above, will be considered only for the five purposes listed above. \n   \nOn April 6, 2017, when Applicant completed her e-QIP, she responded to certain \nquestions pertaining to her illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23 \u2013 Illegal \nUse of Drugs or Drug Activity. The most significant questions, and the ones alleged in the \nSOR, were essentially as follows: In the last seven (7) years \u201chave you illegally used any \ndrugs or controlled substances?\u201d; \u201chave you EVER illegally used or otherwise been \ninvolved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other \nthan previously listed?\u201d; and \u201chave you EVER had a security clearance eligibility/access \nauthorization denied, suspended, or revoked?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to each of the \nquestions. (Item 2, at 29-30) She omitted and concealed her admitted use of marijuana, \ncocaine, and ecstasy, and only acknowledged her misuse of the prescription drug Vicodin \nduring the period October 2011 until April 2012. She also omitted that her application for \neligibility for a top secret clearance with access to SCI was denied by another U.S. \nGovernment agency in March 2017, approximately one month before she submitted her \ne-QIP. She certified that her responses to those questions were \u201ctrue, complete, and \ncorrect\u201d to the best of her knowledge and belief, but, because of her omissions and \nconcealments, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.  \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nIn addition to her extensive use of drugs, Applicant consumed alcohol to excess \nover a multi-year period. From 1992, when she was 17 years old, until 1997, Applicant \nconsumed two to four 12-ounce beers in a one-to-two hour period, once a month while \nsocializing with friends. The quantity and frequency increased while Applicant was in the \nU.S. Army, and she consumed three to five 12-ounce beers or average-sized glasses of \nwine over a three-to-five hour period, twice a week, mainly on the weekends. From 2012 \nto the beginning of 2015, Applicant again altered her consumption habits by drinking two \nto four beers or glasses of wine in a three-to-four hour period, while at home, four times \nper week. Because she was dealing with personal issues, Applicant explained that she \nwas self-medicating with alcohol, and while she intended to consume only one alcoholic \ndrink, she usually ended up consuming two to four drinks. From the beginning of 2015, \nand continuing until April 2016, Applicant consumed three to five beers or average-sized \nglasses of wine over a three-to-five hour period, twice a week while socializing with \nfriends. (Item 8, at 4; Item 9, at 2-3) \n \n \nApplicant contended that to become intoxicated, she needs to consume \napproximately three to five alcoholic beverages during a two-to-three hour period. \nDefining intoxication as having a blood-alcohol-content (BAC) of .08 or higher, Applicant \nacknowledged that from 1992 until the beginning of 2015, she became intoxicated 75 \npercent of the time she consumed alcohol; and from the beginning of 2015 until April \n2016, she became intoxicated 50 percent of the time.  During her pre-polygraph interview \nof April 8, 2016, Applicant acknowledged that she was last intoxicated two days earlier \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nwhen she consumed, over a six-and-one-half hour period, three to four beers, one shot, \nand part of a martini. While she took an Uber from the bar back to her friend\u2019s house, \nApplicant then drove herself approximately ten miles back to her own house. (Item 8, at \n4; Item 9, at 3) Driving while intoxicated was nothing new to Applicant, and during the \n2016 pre-polygraph interview, she acknowledged that she had done so on numerous \noccasions between 1992 and 2016. (Item 8, at 5; Item 9, at 3-4) However, during her \n2018 OPM interview, she stated that the only time she ever drove while intoxicated was \nwhen she was arrested in 2007. (Item 7, at 3) \n \n \nApplicant also acknowledged that she has experienced both short-term and long-\nterm blackouts after consuming alcohol. She agreed that alcohol has negatively impacted \nher in several ways. Nevertheless, as of April 2016, she did not think that she needed \nhelp to stop consuming alcohol and she was confident that she could make positive \nchanges regarding her consumption of alcohol on her own. (Item 8, at 5; Item 9, at 4-5) \nIn 2018, Applicant acknowledged that drinking alcohol gave her a pleasant feeling, and \nshe did not feel that she has a problem with alcohol. Her future intention was to continue \nher current usage or less of alcohol. (Item 7, at 3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with alcohol has resulted in only one known incident \ninvolving police and court authorities. On April 3, 2007, Applicant was celebrating (dining, \ndrinking, and dancing) a birthday with a number of friends from about 6:00 p.m. until early \nthe following morning. She consumed two glasses of wine and five unspecified alcoholic \nbeverages. After the bar closed, she drove herself the ten miles from the bar to her military \nfacility where, at 1:55 a.m. on April 4, 2007, she was stopped at the front gate because \nthe military police officer detected the strong odor of alcohol coming from her. She was \nadministered a field sobriety test, which she failed, and she was arrested and charged \nwith driving under the influence (DUI). Applicant was then administered a breathalyzer \ntest, and it registered a BAC of .141. (Item 12) During her 2016 pre-polygraph interview, \nas well as during her 2018 OPM interview, Applicant minimized her BAC result by claiming \nit registered .12. (Item 8, at 3; Item 9, at 2; Item 7, at 2) Applicant remained in jail over \nnight and was released. Before appearing in court on the charge, Applicant performed \ncommunity service, and she attended unspecified alcohol courses for several months. \nHer charge was later reduced to driving while ability impaired (DWAI), a misdemeanor. \n(Item 8, at 3; Item 9, at 2-3) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)      \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).) \n \n The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns for Personal Conduct under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nAs noted above, Applicant is not a reliable historian regarding her history of drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, because of her inconsistent and frequently false \nstatements in which she either denied, concealed, or omitted significant portions of her \nhistory. Applicant was a recreational substance abuser whose primary substances of \nchoice were marijuana, cocaine, and MDMA \u2013 a psychoactive drug commonly known as \necstasy. She used Vicodin \u2013 a prescription combination of an opioid pain reliever \nhydrocodone and a non-opioid pain reliever acetaminophen \u2013 that was not prescribed for \nher. The focus of the SOR was her drug involvement and substance misuse during certain \nyears while she held a security clearance; and her falsifications regarding same on her \n2017 e-QIP. Succinctly described, Applicant has an extensive history of drug involvement \nand substance misuse, especially while holding a security clearance; and she has not \nbeen fully candid, even when confronted with a polygraph examination. According to \nApplicant, her drug use was not a big deal because it was similar to drinking alcohol. \nMoreover, using the drugs was fun, and she was just enjoying herself doing drugs. \n \nI have considered the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s eventual admissions of \nsome of the SOR allegations. As noted above, Applicant did not controvert the falsification \nallegations. As to personal conduct attributed to the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse; and the personal conduct attributed to the deliberate falsifications on the 2017 e-\nQIP, pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., AG \u00b6 16(c) has been established, and, \npertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. through 1.g., AG \u00b6 16(a) has been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Personal Conduct. They include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nNeither of the conditions apply. Although Applicant finally revealed a significant \nportion of her history of drug involvement and substance misuse in April 2016, when she \nwas confronted with a pre-polygraph examination conducted by another U.S. Government \nagency, Applicant\u2019s false responses to the e-QIP inquiry occurred in April 2017. Although \nshe was interviewed by OPM investigators in 2017 and 2018, she made little effort to \ncorrect the omissions, concealments, or falsifications associated with her 2017 e-QIP. \nApplicant\u2019s attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations while initially seeking, and \nsubsequently holding, a security clearance, lasted for over a decade. Despite her claimed \nnew knowledge and maturity, Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns for \nAlcohol Consumption in AG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nApplicant acknowledged that from 1992 until the beginning of 2015, she became \nintoxicated 75 percent of the time she consumed alcohol; and from the beginning of 2015 \nuntil April 2016, she became intoxicated 50 percent of the time.  During her pre-polygraph \ninterview of April 8, 2016, Applicant acknowledged that she was last intoxicated two days \nearlier when she consumed, over a six-and-one-half hour period, three to four beers, one \nshot, and part of a martini. While she took an Uber from the bar back to her friend\u2019s house, \nApplicant then drove herself approximately ten miles back to her own house. Driving while \nintoxicated, and jeopardizing the welfare and safety of others, was nothing new to \nApplicant, and during the 2016 pre-polygraph interview, she acknowledged that she had \ndone so on numerous occasions between 1992 and 2016. However, during her 2018 \nOPM interview, she stated that the only time she ever drove while intoxicated was when \nshe was arrested for DUI in 2007. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), and 25(c) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Alcohol Consumption:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nNeither of the mitigating conditions apply. As of April 2016, Applicant did not think \nthat she needed help to stop consuming alcohol and she was confident that she could \nmake positive changes regarding her consumption of alcohol on her own. In 2018, \nApplicant acknowledged that drinking alcohol gave her a pleasant feeling, and she did \nnot feel that she has a problem with alcohol. It is significant that while she usually intended \nto consume only one alcoholic drink, she usually ended up consuming two to four drinks, \nand that scenario indicates an inability to control her consumption. Her future intention \nwas to continue her current usage or less of alcohol. Applicant\u2019s position regarding her \npattern of maladaptive alcohol use does not demonstrate a hopeful, much less, \ndemonstrated clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 44-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a system engineer with her \ncurrent employer since January 2008. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in November 1996, and served until April 2004, when \nshe was honorably discharged. Applicant was granted a top secret clearance with access \nto SCI in 1997, and she held that clearance until March 2017.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is not a reliable or candid historian regarding her history of drug involvement \nand substance misuse, and her history of maladaptive alcohol use because of her \ninconsistent and frequently false statements in which she either denied, concealed, or \nomitted significant portions of her histories. Applicant was a recreational substance \nabuser whose primary substances of choice were marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy, and \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nshe used Vicodin that was not prescribed for her. While the focus of the SOR was her \ndrug involvement and substance misuse during certain years while she held a security \nclearance; her falsifications regarding same on her 2017 e-QIP; and her alcohol abuse, \nbecause of her lack of candor generally, as well as her related activities that were not \nalleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s entire history is relevant to the alleged issues. She has \nnot been fully candid, even when confronted with a polygraph examination.  \n \nAccording to Applicant, her drug use was not a big deal because it was similar to \ndrinking alcohol. Moreover, using the drugs was fun, and she was just enjoying herself \ndoing drugs. She routinely consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication and even \nblackouts, but it was far more troubling that she routinely drove while she was intoxicated. \nHer future intention regarding alcohol was to continue her current usage or less. \nApplicant\u2019s position regarding her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use does not \ndemonstrate a hopeful, much less, demonstrated clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence. \n \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a top secret clearance with SCI access was denied by \nanother U.S. Government agency in March 2017. Her attitude towards laws, rules, and \nregulations, is unacceptable, especially for one who was granted a security clearance, \nand was still drinking alcohol to intoxication and concealing her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse when she completed her 2017 e-QIP. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her personal \nconduct and alcohol consumption. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n__________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence and under Guideline F, financial considerations. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 1, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence and Guideline F, financial considerations. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 30, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n04/09/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) containing five Items, and it was received \nby Applicant on February 19, 2019. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant submitted a response to the FORM. He \nobjected to consideration of an account that he no longer held jointly with his wife and \ndisputed a comment that he failed to respond to an email. His objections are sustained, \nand his corrections are noted. No other objections to the Government\u2019s evidence were \nmade. Items 1 through 5 are admitted into evidence. As part of his response to the FORM, \nApplicant provided documents that are marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through G. \nThere was no objection to the exhibits, and they are admitted into evidence. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned this case to me on March 27, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nIn the FORM Department Counsel submitted Item 6, which requested that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about Iraq. Applicant did not object, and I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the request that are supported by source \ndocuments from official U.S. Government publications that were provided with the FORM. \nThe facts are summarized in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e, and 2.a. He denied \nthe SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.b. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He was born in Iraq and earned a college degree there \nin 2003. He married his wife, an Iraqi citizen, in 2012. They have five young children. It is \nunknown where his eldest child was born. His four younger children were born in the \nUnited States. He is presently seeking employment with a federal contractor.1 \n \nApplicant worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq from 2003 to 2006. In January 2010, \nhe was granted a special immigration visa and immigrated to the United States. In his \nSeptember 2017 Questionnaire for National Security Position (SF 86), he disclosed that \nhe lived in the United States from 2010 to April 2016. He traveled back and forth to Iraq \nnumerous times during this period. Applicant became a naturalized citizen of the United \nStates in April 2016 and obtained a U.S. passport the same month. He then moved back \nto Iraq in April 2016. Applicant also disclosed that he still held an Iraqi passport (which \nwill expire in 2022) that he intended to relinquish to his employer after his \ncounterintelligence screening interview (CSI). He stated in his SF 86: \u201cAfter gaining my \nU.S. citizen[ship] in May 2016, I have no use for the passport and will relinquish to \n[prospective employer] as I have renounced the Iraqi citizenship at the Naturalization \n                                                          \n1 Item 3; AE A. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nCeremony.\u201d2 In February 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. \nNoted in the report was Applicant\u2019s foreign travel and date stamps in both his U.S. \npassport and Iraqi passport. His Iraqi passport has entrance to Iraq stamps on May 2016, \nJuly 2016, February 2017; October 2017, and November 2017, subsequent to becoming \na U.S. citizen.3  \n \nApplicant returned to the United States for a week in September 2017, and again \nin approximately October to November 2017, to process his wife and son\u2019s immigration \npaperwork and for an interview. He then returned to Iraq and lived there from November \n2017 to February 2018.4  \n \nApplicant disclosed on his September 2017 SF 86 that his wife is a citizen and \nresident of Iraq. During Applicant\u2019s February 2018 CSI interview, he told the interviewer \nthat he moved back to Iraq because his wife and son wanted to because the cultural \nchanges were tough on them. He said he would move back to the U.S., but wanted to \ngive his wife some more time before making the move back. In his CSI documents, he \nconfirmed at that time that his wife was a citizen and resident of Iraq. Applicant indicated \nin his November 2018 answer to the SOR that his wife is a permanent resident of the \nUnited States, and that she resided in Iraq. He said his son was a U.S. citizen residing in \nIraq. Applicant said in his February 2019 FORM response that his wife was living in the \nUnited States. It is unknown when she moved back, and what her intentions are regarding \nremaining in the United States. Applicant did not provide information as to when his wife \nbecame a permanent resident and when his son became a U.S. citizen. He did not provide \ncorroborating documents as to their status.5  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and two brothers are citizens and residents of Iraq. In his CSI \ndocuments, he disclosed his mother is a homemaker. One brother is an assistant teacher \nand the other is self-employed and has a cosmetic store.6  \n \nApplicant disclosed during his February 2018 background interview that his family \nin Iraq is very wealthy, and he receives approximately $20,000 every two to six months \nfor living expenses. He has received money transfers since 2012 when he married. \nApplicant has a saving and checking account with a U.S. bank that has a balance of about \n$5,500. He also has an Iraqi bank account that he uses to transfer money to his U.S. \naccounts. He told the investigator that he had transferred $10,000 from his Iraqi bank \naccount to his U.S. account when he was in Iraq. The funds were from rent payments \nfrom the various rental properties he owns.7 \n                                                          \n2 Item 3. It is noted that Applicant said he became a U.S. citizen in May 2016, which differs from the date \nhe disclosed on his SF 86. \n \n3 Items 3, 4, 5. \n \n4 Items 4, 5. \n \n6 Items 3, 4, 5.  \n \n7 Item 4. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant disclosed that he owns a residence in Iraq where his immediate family \nresides, and it is paid for in full. He purchased it in 2013 for his family and intended on \nkeeping it for when he visits Iraq. When interviewed for his CSI, he estimated its value at \n$120,000. In his SOR answer, he indicated that its value depends on the real estate \nmarket, so it could be valued less.8  \n \nApplicant co-owns with his mother and brothers a commercial property that has 10 \napartment units. The apartments are rented, and he receives approximately $800 a month \nin revenue. He referred to this as residual income. He estimated the property is valued at \napproximately $500,000. He inherited the property when his father passed away in \nJanuary 2018.9 \n \nApplicant co-owns with his mother and brothers a three-building compound. His \nmother and brothers live in one residence, and they rent the other two residences. They \nreceive rental income of approximately $1,800 monthly. The compound is valued at \napproximately $2,500,000.10 \n \nApplicant disclosed that from 2007 to 2009, he was employed full time by an Iraqi \ncompany. He told the government investigator that he was still employed by the same \nemployer, and he provides services at least once a quarter or as needed. He provided \nhis services both electronically and in person. He completes about five to six tasks for the \ncompany per year and receives approximately $25,000 in cash compensation annually.11  \n \nApplicant disclosed that he was employed by a consulting company in Iraq from \nApril 2016 to the present on a part-time basis. He is compensated about $2,000 a month \nfor his services. He worked from April 2016 to August 2017 for the company while in Iraq. \nFrom August 2017 until at least the date of his interview in February 2018, he was \nemployed by the company and provided services electronically and in-person. Applicant \ndisclosed that while living in the U.S., he was self-employed from January 2010 to April \n2016. He had various commercial jobs and a business where he purchased and sold \nfurniture. He completed these duties from home. He did not have a license or pay taxes \nfor his jobs in the U.S. He was paid in cash.12 \n \n                                                          \n \n8 Items 4, 5.  \n \n9 Items 4, 5. \n \n10 Items 3, 4, 5. Applicant did not disclose any foreign financial or real estate interests in his SF 86. I have \nnot considered any derogatory information that was not alleged for disqualifying conditions. I may consider \nit when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in my whole-\nperson analysis. \n \n11 Items 4, 5.  \n \n12 Items 3, 4, 5. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant also told the government investigator that he was unemployed from April \n2012 to April 2016.13 He filed past federal income tax returns in 2015 and learned he \nowed $20,000 in federal taxes. In his SOR answer, he admitted he failed to timely file his \n2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 federal income tax returns. He said he made payment \narrangements with the IRS and had an installment agreement to pay $230 a month. He \nwas questioned as to why with his financial resources he did not pay the whole amount \nowed. He told the investigator he preferred the settlement agreement.14  \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the $16,000 federal income tax \ndebt was reduced to $9,396. He provided copies of IRS transcripts from November 2018. \nThey confirm that he filed his 2014 federal income tax return in April 2015.15 He provided \na transcript for tax year 2010, which is not alleged.16 He also provided 2011 and 2012 \ntranscripts that show he filed these tax year returns in August 2015. As of the date of the \ntranscripts, the balances owed were $420 for 2010; $4,589 for 2011, and $4,846 for 2012. \nApplicant did not provide a tax transcript for 2013. The transcripts also reflect that \nApplicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in 2015, and he made \ninconsistent payments through 2018. His 2014 transcript reflects some payments were \nredirect to his 2010 tax liability. The transcripts also reflect that tax years 2011 and 2012 \nwere no longer in an installment agreement.17  \n \nIn his FORM response, Applicant provided a document from the IRS from \nDecember 2018. It stated that the IRS had accepted an installment agreement from \nApplicant to pay $230 monthly. It reflected it included tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, and \n2014. Also provided was proof of a payment made to the IRS in December 2018 for $230. \nApplicant stated in his response that his tax-debt balance was now approximately $2,739 \nbecause he was owed a refund of $6,090 for tax year 2018 that was applied to his tax \nbalance. Applicant did not provide corroborating documents to show his current tax \nbalance.18 \n \nIRAQ \n \n \nThe United States Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq remain at \nhigh risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence and to avoid all travel to Iraq. The ability of \nthe U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad is \n                                                          \n13 Item 4. It is noted that Applicant\u2019s statements to the investigator about his employment are inconsistent. \n \n14 Items 4, 5. \n \n15 It is alleged that Applicant\u2019s 2014 federal tax returns were filed untimely. The IRS documents provided \nshow the 2014 return was filed timely.  \n \n16 Item 4. Applicant\u2019s 2010 federal income tax return was filed in July 2015. I will not consider this for \ndisqualifying purposes as noted above because it was not alleged. \n \n17 Item 2.  \n \n18 Item 4; AE A, D, E, F. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nextremely limited given the security environment. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \n(ISIS) controls a significant portion of Iraq\u2019s territory. Within areas under ISIS control, the \nIraqi government has little or no ability to control and ensure public safety. \n \n \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such \ngroups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay also threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. U.S. \nGovernment and western interests remain possible targets for attacks.  \n \n \nThe U.S. Government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. \ngovernment personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under \nstrict security guidelines.  \n \n \nThere are significant human rights problems in Iraq to include: sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, lack of transparency at all levels of government and society that \nhave weakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights \nprotections. Iraqi security forces and members of the Federal Police have committed \nhuman rights violations to include killing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. ISIS is also \nresponsible for human rights abuses. There are also problems that include harsh and life-\nthreatening conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest and lengthy \npretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression, freedom of \nthe press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful assembly, and societal abuses of \nwomen.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and son are citizens of Iraq. There was insufficient evidence to \nfind that Applicant\u2019s wife is now a permanent resident and his son is a citizen of the United \nStates. It appears they may now be residing in the United States. It is unknown when she \nmoved. Applicant\u2019s mother and two brothers are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant\u2019s \nfamily provides him with substantial financial support for living expenses. Applicant and \nhis family own properties in Iraq, and he receives substantial income from their properties. \nApplicant also owns a home in Iraq that is used for his immediate family. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \ncitizenship status, his family residing in Iraq, and his financial interests create a \nheightened risk and a potential foreign influence concern. There is an articulated \nheightened risk associated with having ties to family members in Iraq, due to the activities \nof terrorist organizations and insurgents operating within its borders. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nNone of the above conditions are mitigating in this instance. Applicant is obviously \nin close contact with his wife, son, mother, and brothers. He receives substantial income \nfrom his family for living expenses. He also receives substantial income as a joint property \nowner of real estate in Iraq, with his mother and brothers. The property values are \nsignificant. I cannot find his property interests in Iraq are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used to influence, manipulate or pressure Applicant, especially considering \nthat the two more expensive properties are owned jointly with his family and are where \nthey reside. Applicant continues to have substantial business ties to Iraq, working for \ncompanies there. Due to Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his family and the terrorist \nthreats and human rights abuses in Iraq, I cannot find it is unlikely he would be placed in \na position of choosing between them and the interests of the United States.  \n \nApplicant failed to demonstrate deep and longstanding loyalties to the United \nStates. Applicant did not provide evidence of property interests in the United States and \nthere is insufficient evidence on assets, or physical or emotional bonds to the United \nStates. There is insufficient evidence that he has ties to a community in the U.S. Shortly \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen, he moved back to Iraq where he lived with his wife in the \nfamily home he owns. His income is derived from rental properties in Iraq. Without more \ninformation, it cannot be determined that Applicant would resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable:  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n \n(g) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2011 through 2013 federal income tax returns. He \nowed approximately $16,000 in federal income taxes. He arranged an installment \nagreement with the IRS. The evidence supports he had the financial means to make the \nmonthly $230 payments, but his payments were inconsistent. There is sufficient evidence \nto support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for 2011 through 2013. In \n2015 the returns were filed, and he established an installment agreement with the IRS. \nBased on the documents he provided he made inconsistent payments. He reestablished \nan installment agreement with the IRS in December 2018, and made a payment. He said \nhis tax liability was reduced when his 2018 tax refund was applied to his prior year tax \ndebts. Applicant failed to provide corroborating documents to substantiate his statements.  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. I have considered that Applicant might have been unfamiliar \nwith the requirements to file his tax returns because he had recently immigrated to the \n\n \n11 \n \n \nUnited States. However, after he did file them, he failed to adhere to the installment \nagreement he had with the IRS. He provided evidence that he had the financial resources \nto make the monthly payments. I find he failed to act responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply. There is no evidence Applicant received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. Applicant initially began to pay his tax liability through an installment agreement \nwith the IRS, but then failed to follow through. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. In December \n2018, Applicant reestablished an installment agreement with the IRS to pay his past tax \nliability. He provided proof that he made the initial payment. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since 2016. He \nworked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq from 2003 to 2006 and was granted a special \nimmigration visa. I have considered his service to the United States. Applicant maintains \nsignificant emotional, financial and business ties to Iraq. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show he has substantial ties to the United States. He failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. Applicant owed federal income \ntaxes for past tax years. Although he arranged with the IRS in 2015 to pay them through \nan installment agreement, he made inconsistent payments, despite having the financial \nresources. He failed to provide documents to corroborate the current balance owed on \nhis past-due taxes. He recently reestablished an installment agreement, but his actions \nare insufficient to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns under Guideline \n\n \n12 \n \n \nF. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 29, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2019.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on March 21, \n2019, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on May 8, 2019. The Government \noffered three exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant called one witness and offered nine exhibits, \nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I, which were admitted without objection.  \n\n \n2 \n \nHe also testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nMay 28, 2019. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe Russian Federation. Department Counsel provided a ten-page summary of the \nfacts, supported by twenty-three Government documents pertaining to Russia.  \n(Government Exhibit 3).  The documents provide elaboration and context for the \nsummary.  Applicant had no objection.  I take administrative notice of the facts included \nin the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR.  After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and is married to a registered foreign national from \nRussia.  He has a Bachelor\u2019s of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  He holds the position of Program Manager with a defense \ncontractor.  Applicant has never held a security clearance before.  He began working for \nhis current employer in 2016.         \n \n \n Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen, who was born on a U.S. Air Force Base.    \nHis parents, both his father and step-mother, are native-American citizens, who served \nin the U.S. Air Force while Applicant was growing up.  As a \u201cmilitary brat\u201d, Applicant has \ntraveled with his parents to a variety of duty stations around the world on military work \nassignments.      \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s step-mother served in the U.S. Air Force for twenty-three years \nbefore she retired in 2009.  Applicant\u2019s father served twenty years until he retired in \n2001.  Both his father and step-mother currently work for government contractors and \nhold SCI-level clearances.      \n \n \n \nApplicant met a woman in Beijing, China, who later became his wife, while \nworking as a traveling engineer for a U.S. company.  She was a Russian national who \nwas in China working on her Master\u2019s degree in Linguistics, and studying Chinese.  \nApplicant explained that they really hit it off, spent time together and worked on their \nrelationship after that.  (Tr. p. 33.)  Applicant and his wife were married in February \n2016, and they have known each other for seven years.  She will be applying for her full \nU.S. citizenship by the end of May 2019.  Applicant\u2019s wife works as a paralegal for a law \nfirm, where she has worked for the past two years.  (Tr. pp. 44-45).     \n    \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-law are citizens and residents of Russia.  \nHis father-in-law served as a Major in the Russian military.  His job centered around \nfood service, and he stayed in longer than required in order to receive educational \nbenefits.  (Tr. p. 37.)  He left the military in 2000 and he has not been involved with the \nRussian Government in any capacity since then.  Applicant has met him on two \noccasions.  He does not speak English and Applicant does not speak Russian and so \ncommunication is difficult.  Applicant has no future plans to return to Russia.  (Tr. p. 39.)  \nHe has no details concerning Applicant\u2019s employment nor has he even shown an \ninterest.    \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law also served in the Russian military from 1990 to 1994 \nin order to obtain educational benefits.  While in the military, she served as an \nadministrative assistant.  She currently works as an Engineer.  Applicant does not \nbelieve the company is associated with the Russian Government in in any capacity.  (Tr. \np. 41.)  Applicant\u2019s mother in law does not speak English and is unable to communicate \nwith the Applicant.  She has no details concerning Applicant\u2019s employment.   \n \n \nIn June 2014, on a trip to Moscow to visit his wife, in a passing social situation, \nApplicant was introduced to two friends of Applicant\u2019s wife who are citizens and \nresidents of Russia.  They are not friends of the Applicant.  Applicant does not talk with \nthem and has no contact with them.  One of the women was employed as an \nadministrative assistance for the Russian Government and was a friend of Applicant\u2019s \nwife, but they had a falling out and are no longer friends.  Applicant\u2019s wife no longer \nspeaks with her.  The other woman, a friend of Applicant\u2019s wife, is currently studying in \nChina for her own Master\u2019s degree.  Applicant\u2019s wife no longer has contact with her.  \n(Tr. p. 44.)     \n \n \nApplicant testified that he understands his responsibility while holding a security \nclearance to report any foreign contact and to never compromise national security under \nany circumstances.  Applicant further stated that if he were placed in a situation where a \nforeign national was attempting to get information from him that he knew they were not \nentitled to, or that he should not be sharing, he would immediately report the contact to \nhis security officer.  (Tr. p. 45.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, who holds a security clearance, testified that Applicant is \ntrustworthy and responsible, and will not let his relationship with his wife or in-laws ever \ninfluence his dedication and loyalties to the United States.  His father also states that he \nand his company security officer are cognizant of the Russian foreign contact concern in \nhis family, and regularly monitors the situation to ensure that no security risk exists.  (Tr. \npp. 22- 31.) \n \n \nLetters of recommendation from professional colleagues and friends of the \nApplicant attest to his professional behavior, strong work ethics, leadership skills, good \nmoral character, honesty, trustworthiness and reliability.  He is considered to be a stellar \nemployee and a valuable team member.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance review for the period from 2017 and 2018 reflects that \nhe \u201cexceeds\u201d job requirements.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  While a student at a University, \nApplicant\u2019s technical paper was published online in 2011.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts about the Russian \nFederation, also known as Russia.  Russia is one of the most aggressive, capable, and \nactive, high risk locations for crime that affects the U.S. government interests.  Russian \nintelligence works diligently as collectors of sensitive U.S. technologies.  Not all \ncountries seek unauthorized access to classified information in order to harm the United \nStates.  Some countries seek such unauthorized access in order to reap the benefits of \nsensitive U.S technology for themselves.  Russia uses cyber operations as an \ninstrument of intelligence collection to inform its decision-making and benefit its \neconomic interests and Russian intelligence services have conducted sophisticated and \nlarge-scale hacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and technology \ninformation.  Other methods of collection include, Russian commercial and academic \nenterprises interacting with the West; recruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced \ntechnical skills by the Russian intelligence services; and Russian intelligence \npenetration of public and private enterprises, which enable the Russian government to \nobtain sensitive technical information from industry.  The areas of highest interest to \nRussian intelligence collectors include energy/alternative energy; biotechnology; \ndefense technology; environmental protection; high-end manufacturing; and information \nand communications technology.  (Government Exhibit 3.) \n \n \nRussia\u2019s recently reported efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential election \nrepresent the most recent expression of Russia\u2019s long standing desire to undermine the \nU.S. led liberal democratic order and it is noted that \u201cthese activities demonstrated a \nsignificant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to \nprevious operations.\u201d  The 2016 influence campaign reflected Russian\u2019s recognition of \nthe worldwide effects that mass disclosure of U.S. Government and other private data \nhas achieved in recent years.  Russia is continuing to develop capabilities to provide \nPresident Putin with options to use against the United States.  (Government Exhibit 3.)   \n \n \nHuman rights issues continue to be a significant problem including extrajudicial \nkillings; enforced disappearance; torture that was systematic and sometimes resulted in \ndeath and sometimes included punitive psychiatric incarcerations; harsh and life-\nthreatening conditions in prisons; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of judicial \nindependence; political prisoners; severe interference with privacy; severe restrictions \non freedom of expression and the media; increasingly severe restriction on freedom of \nassociation, including laws on \u201cforeign agents\u201d and \u201cundesirable foreign organizations\u201d; \nand widespread corruption at all levels and in all branches of government.  The Russian \ngovernment failed to take adequate steps to prosecute or punish most officials who \ncommitted abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity.  (Government Exhibit 3.)     \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7.  Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n          Applicant\u2019s foreign family members includes his father-in-law, and mother in law, \nwho are citizens and residents of Russia. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \n\n \n7 \n \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \n \nHaving considered the fact that Russia presents a heightened risk to the national \nsecurity of the U.S., the nature of the relationships with Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family there do \nnot pose a security risk.  Applicant has little or no contact with his in-laws, and does not \nspeak their language, nor do they speak his.  Applicant was introduced to two Russian \nfriends of his wife\u2019s.  His wife no longer has any further contact with the one who was at \none time associated with the Russian Government, and little or no contact with the \nlinguist who is working toward her Master\u2019s degree and currently studying Chinese in \nBeijing.  Applicant is an American citizen whose parents served life-time military \ncareers.  His parents currently work for defense contractors and hold high-level security \nclearances.  The Applicant, as well as his father, is cognizant of the sensitivity of the \nrelationship with his wife and the importance of protecting the national secrets.  \nApplicant resides with his spouse, who is from Russia, but she too is ingrained into the \nAmerican culture, and is simply awaiting to be eligible to become a citizen.  There is \nnothing in the record to show that these foreign contacts pose a heightened risk of \nforeign influence.  Full mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), has been established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nThere is compelling evidence showing that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family in Russian do \nnot pose a heightened risk of foreign influence.  It is noted that Russia continues to act \nas one of the most active, aggressive and capable collectors of intelligence targeting the \nU.S.  However, there is sufficient information in this record to prove that Applicant\u2019s \ncasual connections with his father-in-law and mother-in-law in Russia do not pose a \nsecurity risk. Everything the Applicant has was given to him by the U.S., including his \njob and his education.  Applicant has no plans of ever returning to Russia.  Applicant\u2019s \nwife plans to become a naturalized citizen as soon as she is eligible.  Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with Russia does not subject him to foreign influence that could cause him \nto make decisions that are against the national interests.     \n   \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concern.    \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:, through 1.c.  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. (Government Exhibit 1.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted allegations 1.a through 1.g in the SOR with explanations. She denied allegation 1.h. She also submitted additional evidence to support her request for a finding of national security eligibility.

Based on \na review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 15, 2017. (Government Exhibit 1.) On December 17, 2018, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of \nDefense on or after June 8, 2017. \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on March 7, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non March 21, 2019. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on April 18, \n2019. The case was reassigned to me on May 13, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on June 10, 2019. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on July 31, 2019. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits A \nthrough G, which were admitted without objection, and testified on her own behalf. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open to permit her to submit additional \nevidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 12, 2019. Applicant \nsubmitted Applicant Exhibit H on August 14, 2019. Department Counsel had no objection \nand the exhibit was admitted into evidence. The record then closed.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and employed by a defense contractor. She is married, \nbut separated, and has three children. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. \nShe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. \n(Government Exhibit 1.)  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause she is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted allegations 1.a through 1.g in the \nSOR with explanations. She denied allegation 1.h. She also submitted additional \nevidence to support her request for a finding of national security eligibility. \n \n \nThe SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that she owed approximately $98,945 \nin past-due indebtedness to various creditors. Support for the existence and amount of \nthe debts is supported by admissions of the Applicant, and credit reports submitted by the \nGovernment dated September 8, 2017; October 1, 2018; and July 28, 2019. (Government \nExhibits 1, 3, 2, and 4.)  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that her financial problems, as set out below, were due to several \nextenuating \ncircumstances. \nShe \nhad \nissues \nrelated \nto \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment. In addition, there were acts of malfeasance by her husband, from \nwhom she is now separated. Applicant also had medical issues related to the premature \nbirth of her third child in 2016. (Answer; Tr. 31-32, 108.) \n \n \nThe current status of the debts is as follows:  \n \n \n1.a through 1.d. Applicant admitted that she owed four charged-off Federal student \nloans in the aggregate amount of $84,869. Applicant began attempting to resolve these \ndebts beginning in 2017. She consolidated them under a single payer in July 2017. \nHowever, in May 2018 she lost her job and was unable to continue agreed payments. \nAfter obtaining new employment Applicant again reached out to the creditor. A new \npayment plan was started beginning in October 2018 whereby Applicant would pay $100 \na month to rehabilitate the loan. Applicant provided documentary information showing that \nshe has been making consistent payments under the new plan. Her intent is to settle this \ndebt. This debt is being resolved under terms acceptable to the creditor. (Applicant \nExhibits A and H; Tr. 31-41, 71-81.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that she is current on her other student loans. Credit reports \nsubmitted by the Government support her statement. (Government Exhibits 2, 3, and 4; \nTr. 35-37.) \n \n \nThe next two allegations will be discussed in chronological order. Applicant\u2019s \nhusband, from whom she is now separated, submitted a statement concerning the facts \nsurrounding these two debts, and taking responsibility for the actions that precipitated the \nbad debts. (Applicant Exhibit C.) \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admitted owing a charged-off automobile loan in the amount of \n$5,285. She purchased this car in about 2008 and made regular payments for several \nyears. Applicant allowed her husband to use the vehicle starting in about 2009, as long \nas he made the monthly payments. He made the payments until approximately 2012, \nwhen the vehicle had to be repaired. The husband did not have the car repaired, and lied \nto Applicant about that fact. Eventually, Applicant discovered the subterfuge and, when \nshe attempted to retrieve the vehicle, was told by the repair shop owner that the car had \nbeen sold for non-payment of past-due storage fees. Applicant has been unable to find \nout any additional information about the location of the car. She has filed a dispute with \nthe finance company and the credit reporting agencies with regard to this debt. (Answer; \nGovernment Exhibit 4; Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 45-49, 82-87.)  \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admitted owing a charged-off automobile loan in the amount of \n$7,589. She purchased this car in about 2009. After the problems with the car described \nin allegation 1.f, Applicant allowed her husband to use this car, as long as he made the \npayments. This car also had mechanical problems due to the husband\u2019s actions, he \nsubsequently stopped paying the loan, and eventually the loan went into default in \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \napproximately 2014. Applicant no longer has possession of this car, either. Applicant \nreached a payment arrangement with this creditor in July 2019, and has made the first \ntwo payments in a timely fashion. This debt is being resolved. (Answer; Government \nExhibit 4; Applicant Exhibits B and C; Tr. 43-45, 50-58, 87-89.) \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admitted owing a past-due debt of $778 for a credit card. Applicant \nreached a payment arrangement with the creditor and paid this debt in February 2019. \nThis debt has been resolved. (Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. 58-60.) \n \n \n1.h. Applicant denied that she owed a creditor $424 for a past-due cable television \ndebt. She contacted the cable television company, who told her that her account had a \nzero balance as of 2012. This debt only appeared on the oldest of the Government\u2019s three \ncredit bureau reports. This debt is in dispute. (Answer; Government Exhibits 2, 3, and 4; \nTr. 60-62, 89-91.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. She is able to pay her current \nmonthly expenses with no trouble. A budget provided by Applicant, which includes \npayments for her student loans, shows that Applicant is solvent at the end of every month. \nAs stated, the credit reports show that Applicant has additional student loans that are \ncurrent. She no longer uses credit cards. Applicant understands the importance of \nresolving her past-due debts and is committed to remaining fiscally secure into the future. \n(Government Exhibits 2, 3, and 4; Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 62-70.)  \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant provided five letters of recommendation from people who knew her as \nwork associates. The writers know of her financial situation. She is described as being \nhonest, responsible, and a person with integrity. (Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 22-31.) (See \nApplicant Exhibit G.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant had approximately $98,945 in past-due debts that she had not paid as \nof the time the SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has paid, legitimately disputed, or otherwise resolved the debts in the \nSOR. She admitted making poor decisions in trusting her husband to make loan \npayments for two cars she gave him, which eventually went into collections because of \nhis misconduct. Since their separation, Applicant has worked hard to resolve one of the \ncar loans, one of the other debts, and her delinquent student loans. She has a reasonable \nand documented basis to dispute the other two debts. The DOHA Appeal Board has said, \n\u201cAn applicant is not required to show that she has completely paid off her indebtedness, \nonly that she has established a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has taken \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nsignificant actions to implement that plan.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. \n17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006).) Applicant \nhas done this. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial status is stable. She evinces a credible intent and the \nability to maintain that stability into the future. She has fully mitigated all the allegations in \nthe SOR. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding her financial situation by her conduct to resolve her debts in the recent \npast. Overall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility, and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn February 7, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national security \nto grant him security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Nat. Sec. \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) \neffective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n2 \n \nOn March 25, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, admitting all of the \nallegations. He requested a decision based on the written record rather than a hearing. On \nApril 10, 2019, Department Counsel prepared a file of relevant material (FORM).  Applicant \nreceived the FORM on April 16, 2019, and was notified that he could file a reply, together \nwith attachments supplementing the information in the FORM, within 30 days, if desired. \nHe did not do so.  The FORM was assigned to me on June 4, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant is a 32-year-old, single man. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011, and \nhas been employed as a research engineer for a federal contractor since April 2017. (Item \n3 at 12-13) \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana approximately three times a week between 2004 and \nMarch 2018. (Item 4 at 10) During that time, he spent approximately $150 monthly for its \npurchase. (Item 4 at 10) Part of the period that he used marijuana overlapped with the \nperiod of time that he held a security clearance. (Item 2 at 2) During his March 2018 \ninterview with an investigative agent, he pledged to abstain from using marijuana in the \nfuture. (Item 4 at 10)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n\n3 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance abuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant abused marijuana between 2004 and 2018, spending approximately $150 \nmonthly for its purchase. During part of that time, he held a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), \u201cany substance abuse,\u201d 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or \npossession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position,\u201d apply. Given the length of time \nApplicant abused marijuana, and the recency of his last use of marijuana, his promise to \nabstain from future use has minimal probative value. None of the mitigating conditions \napply.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant has not used marijuana for more than two years, he used it for \nthe previous six years, and despite having been granted a security clearance. Under these \ncircumstances, it is too soon to conclude that he has mitigated the drug involvement \nsecurity concern.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s history of drug use is disqualifying under this guideline \nfor the same reasons that it is disqualifying under Guideline H, as discussed above. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \n\n4 \n \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct;(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nConsidering the length of time Applicant used marijuana, and the minimal period of \ntime that has elapsed since his last use, it is too soon to conclude that he has minimized \nthe drug abuse security concern. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 11, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons \nunder the drug involvement and substance misuse guidelines why DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance shouild be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended. DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive); by the Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 11, 2019, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on March 6, 2019. He supplemented the record in April 2019 with a \nmemorandum and did not object to any of the Government\u2019s submissions. Applicant\u2019s \nsupplemented memorandum was admitted without objection as Item 5. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) used, purchased, and sold marijuana \nwith varying frequency from about August 2011 to at least May 2017; (b) used cocaine, \nwith varying frequency, from about May 2012 to at least January 2018; and (c) was \ncharged with possession of marijuana paraphernalia in about June 2012. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations covering his \ndrug activities and charges with explanations. He claimed he has not used, bought, or \nsold marijuana since May 2017. He further claimed that he no longer associates with \nindividuals with whom he used marijuana. Applicant claimed he will attend any drug \nrehabilitation considered necessary and will abstain from all drug involvement. And, he \nclaimed he is committed to living a healthy drug-free lifestyle and has a strong support \nsystem that is filled with individuals committed to helping Applicant maintain a healthy \nlifestyle and drug-free living. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old systems engineer who seeks a security clearance for a \ndefense contractor. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nadopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant has never married and has no children. (Items 3-4) He attended college \nclasses between June 2012 and October 2017, but never earned a degree or diploma. \nApplicant reported no military service. \nSince August 2016, Applicant has worked for his current employer. (Items 2-4) He \nreported unemployment between April 2013 and August 2016 while attending school, \nand December 2012. (Item 3) \nApplicant's drug history \nApplicant was introduced to marijuana as a teenager in August 2011. (Item 4) \nTypically, he would smoke marijuana joints recreationally with friends in small quantities \nat their homes and at parties. He generally purchased marijuana from third parties before \ntransferring or reselling the marijuana to his high school friends. (Item 4) Marijuana \nproduced psychedelic reactions by Applicant. Between 2011 and 2014, he used \nmarijuana weekly. Over the course of the next three years, he reduced his frequency of \nuse to monthly and less before ceasing his use of the substance altogether. (Item 3) He \nlast used marijuana in May 2017 and no longer associates with the individuals who \n2 \n\n                                                       Policies \nsupplied him marijuana. (Item 4) Applicant assured that he has no intention of resuming \nhis use of illegal drugs in the foreseeable future and is willing to submit to randomized \ndrug screening by his employer. (Items 2 and 5) His assurances cannot be fully accepted \nwithout more corroboration and substantiation. (Items 3-4) \nBeginning in May 2012, Applicant used cocaine in varying frequencies. (Item 4) \nHe last used the substance in January 2018. (Item 4) He was introduced to cocaine by \nan unknown individual at a local party while in college, (Item 4) He estimated that he had \nused cocaine approximately five to seven times before he lat used the substance in \nJanuary 2018 following his submission of his application for a security clearance. (Items \n3-4) \nIn June 2012, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana paraphernalia. \n(Item 4) He pled not-guilty to the offense and was cleared of the offense in court. (GEs 3-\n4) \nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations \nthat could affect the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. These guidelines include conditions that could raise as security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the conditions that \ncould mitigate security concerns. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require \nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is \nto be evaluated in the context of the whole-person in accordance with AG, \u00b6 2\u00a9 \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nof the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial into \naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and impartial \ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines \nwithin the  context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine \na sufficient period of an applicant's life to enable predictive judgments to be made about \nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. When evaluating an applicant's \nconduct, the relevant guidelines are to be considered together with the following AG \u00b6\n2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of \nthe conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or \nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for \n3 \n\n                                                    Drug Involvement \n                                            Burden of Proof \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be \nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. [s]ecurity-clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\" See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 531 (1988). And because all security clearances must be clearly consistent with the \nnational interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the Applicant. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication \npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:                                    \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to \ninclude the misuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs, \nand the use of other substances that causes physical or \nmental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such \nbehavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment \nand because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations . . . AG \n\u00b6 24. \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. See United States v. Gideon, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). As with all \nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have are \nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that the \nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a \nsecurity clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, \n4 \n\n                                                         Analysis \nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be \nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \"[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\" See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 531 (1988). And, because all security clearances must be clearly consistent with the \nnational interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with th Applicant.\nApplicant is a systems engineer who presents with a considerable history of drug \ninvolvement over an extended period of years. Principal security issues in this case \ncenter on Applicant's lengthy history of drug involvement that includes a still very recent \nJanuary 2018 cocaine use. \nDrug concerns \nOver a considerable period of drug activity stretching from August 2011 to may \n2017, Applicant used, purchased, and sold marijuana. His most recent involvement with \nmarijuana (use, possession, purchases, and sales) occurred in May 2017.  Besides his \nmarijuana use and activity, Applicant used cocaine on multiple occasions with varying \nfrequency between May 2012 and January 2018. Applicant\u2019s admissions to using and \npossessing illegal drugs over an extended number of years raises concerns about risks \nof recurrence as well as judgment issues. Applicant\u2019s admissions to using and \npossessing illegal drugs raises concerns about risks of recurrence as well as judgment \nissues.  On the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying conditions of the \nAGs for drug abuse are applicable: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \"any substance misuse,\u201d and 25(c) \n\"illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  \nWhile Applicant's material use and possession of illegal drugs has never been \nrepeated since his acknowledged last use of marijuana in May 2017, and of cocaine in \nJanuary 2018, in any proven way, his recurrent use and possession of marijuana and \ncocaine products is still too recent to enable safe predictions of continued avoidance of \nillegal drugs. It is too soon to fully apply any of the potentially mitigating conditions to \nApplicant's situation. While Applicant's assurances that his drug involvement is a thing of \nthe past are encouraging, more time is needed to draw safe inferences that he is not a \nrecurrence risk. \nConsidering the record as a whole, there is insufficient probative evidence of \nsustainable mitigation to make predictable judgments about his ability to avoid drugs, \ndrug purchases, and drug sales in the foreseeable future. Taking into account all of the \n5 \n\nfacts and circumstances surrounding Applicant's past marijuana and cocaine activity, he \ndoes not mitigate security concerns with respect to the allegations covered by \nsubparagraphs \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b of the SOR. Based on the not-guilty conclusions associated \nwith Applicant\u2019s 2012 possession of marijuana paraphernalia charges, allegations \ncovered by SOR \u00b6 1.c are unsubstantiated. \nWhole-person assessment \nIn making a whole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment, consideration is given to not only the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse issues raised in the SOR, but the contributions he has and continues \nto make to his employer and the defense industry in general. Overall, though, Applicant \nhas established insufficient probative evidence of his overall trustworthiness and \nunderstanding of DoD policy constraints on the use of illegal substances to facilitate safe \npredictions that he is at no risk of recurrence of illegal drug usage. Criteria for meeting \nsecurity clearance requirements under the drug involvement and substance misuse \nguideline have not for the most part been met by Applicant Unfavorable conclusions are \nwarranted with respect to SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b. Favorable conclusions are warranted with \nrespect to the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I \nmake the following formal findings: \nGUIDELINE H (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):                 AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b\n      Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:                                         For Applicant \n: \n \nConclusions \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nnot clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nto hold a security clearance.

He mitigated the concerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct and Guideline \nG, alcohol consumption. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 9, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J, E, and G. \nThe DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 31, 2019, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on May 21, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and \n\n \n2 \n \n \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 21, 2019, and the hearing was held \nas scheduled on July 23, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 22, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection, except for GE 5, which objection \nwas sustained. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. \nApplicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-E, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 5, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h and 2.a \u2013 2.b, with explanations. He denied \nthe remaining allegations. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since \nDecember 2015. Before his current position he served in the U.S. Air Force, retiring \nafter 20 years of honorable service. He holds a master\u2019s degree. He is divorced and has \ncustody of his two children. He was married from 2009 to 2016. All the allegations of \ndomestic violence involved Applicant and his former spouse (FS). (Tr. 6, 7, 29-30, 32-\n33, 84; AE1, 2)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant was charged with domestic violence or harassment \nin March 2001, September 2001, January 2004, May 2004, May 2013, November 2013, \nand April 2014 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.g; 2.c). It also alleged that since 2010, police were \ncalled to Applicant\u2019s home based upon reports of domestic disturbances on at least 25 \noccasions (SOR \u00b6 1.h). The SOR also alleged that in June 2014, Applicant was \ndemoted and received a letter of reprimand from his Air Force command as a result of \nthe November 2013 domestic disturbance incident (SOR \u00b6 2.a). It also alleged Applicant \nlocked FS out his house in May 2018. When the police were called, they informed \nApplicant that she was considered a resident and must be allowed access to the \nproperty (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The SOR also alleged Applicant falsified his November 2016 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) by failing to list the criminal offenses he was \ncharged with in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h (SOR \u00b6 2.d). His use of alcohol was alleged as a \nfactor in the criminal and domestic abuse incidents listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h (SOR \u00b6 \n3.a). \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that his volatile relationship with FS goes back to before they \nwere married. He further admitted that they both were at fault for letting their domestic \ndisagreements foment into larger issues which required law enforcement involvement. \nHe admitted engaging in arguments and breaking FS\u2019s cell phone, but he denied ever \nphysically hitting or striking her. (Tr. 43-44; 67-68) Records establish that Applicant was \ncriminally charged on the following occasions: \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nMarch 2001\u2014charged with harassment\u2014pleaded guilty\u2014sentenced to \ndeferred sentence\u2014ordered to attend domestic violence counseling. \n(Tr. 37-39; GE 9-10); \n \nSeptember 2001\u2014charged with harassment\u2014dismissed\u2014charged \nwith \nviolating \nrestraining \norder\u2014pleaded \nguilty\u2014sentenced \nto \nprobation for 24 months and required to attend domestic violence \ncounselling for 36 sessions. (Tr. 39-40; GE 11-12); \n \nJanuary 2004\u2014charged with obstructing telephone service, false \nimprisonment, harassment\u2014all charges dismissed. (Tr. 41; GE 13-14); \n \nMay 2004\u2014charged with harassment\u2014charge dismissed. (Tr. 41-42; \nGE 15-16); \n \nMay 2013\u2014charged with criminal mischief (breaking FS\u2019s cell \nphone)\u2014pleaded guilty\u2014sentenced to supervised probation and \ndomestic violence counseling. (Tr. 43-45; GE 8, 17-18); \n \nNovember 2013\u2014charged with violation of protective order; child \nabuse; criminal mischief; resisting arrest; harassment\u2014all charges \ndismissed. (Tr. 45-50; GE 19-20); \n \nApril 2014\u2014charged with assault; harassment; and violation of \nprotective order\u2014all charges dismissed. (Tr. 55, 57-59; GE 21-22). \n \n \nBetween January 2010 and May 2018, approximately 37 phone calls were made \nto the local police department from Applicant\u2019s residence claiming domestic \ndisturbances between Applicant, FS (before and after their divorce), and his daughters. \nThese incidents are reflected in approximately 100 pages worth of transcripts. A May \n2018 incident involved Applicant locking FS out of his house even though he gave her \npermission to stay in the house. Police told Applicant he had to let her into the house or \npursue eviction proceedings. Applicant and FS divorced in January 2016. He allowed \nFS to resume living in his house in September 2017 and she remains residing there. \n(Tr. 33, 80-81, 84; GE 7) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that alcohol was involved when he was arrested in November \n2013. Applicant claims he was evaluated by the Air Force about any alcohol issues after \nthis incident, but no treatment recommendation was made. The record contains no \ndocumentation of any alcohol treatment evaluation or counseling for Applicant. Several \nof the domestic disturbance phone calls from Applicant\u2019s residence to the police \nreferenced Applicant using alcohol. Applicant denied that his alcohol use led to any of \nthe reported incidents. (Tr. 65-67, 87; GE 7) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe demotion action against the Applicant by the Air Force in April-July 2014 was \na consequence of Applicant\u2019s arrest in November 2013 (# 6 above), not an independent \nincident. I find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 2.a. (AE D, E) \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in November 2016. \nIn answering Section 22-Police Record, Applicant responded in the affirmative when \nhe was asked about arrests by law enforcement within the past seven years. He then \nlisted arrests in November 2013 and April 2014. The SOR incorrectly stated that he \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the above question. Applicant credibly testified that any omissions \nwhile completing his SCA were unintentional. Department Counsel conceded this \nallegation at the hearing. I find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 2.d. (Tr. 35, 89; \nGE 1) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n5 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.  \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with seven domestic violence offenses \nbetween 2001 and 2014. I find that the stated disqualifying condition applies.  \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant has not been arrested for a criminal offense involving FS since 2014. \nThis is a sufficient period to show some amount of rehabilitation concerning criminal \nactivity. Both AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) have some application.   \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \n \n \n \nThere is evidence to support that Applicant was using alcohol during at least one \noccasion when he was arrested for domestic violence. There are also references to his \nusing alcohol on several occasions when family members called the police lodging \ndomestic disturbance complaints. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies.  \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment.  \n \nSufficient time has passed without another alcohol-related incident. AG \u00b6 23(a) \napplies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \nBased upon the general personal security concern in AG \u00b6 15 and the specific \nconcern expressed in AG \u00b6 16(c), Applicant\u2019s seven arrests for domestic violence \noffenses and his continued domestic entanglement with FS, often requiring police \nintervention, as recently as May 2018, raise questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nAppellant\u2019s continuous volatile relationship with FS, even after their divorce, often \nled to police involvement. These incidents have occurred from 2001 to 2018 and are not \nminor. His actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b617(c) \ndoes not apply. Applicant successfully completed Level A domestic violence group \ntreatment in September 2014. However, because he continues to have disputes with \nFS, who he allows to reside in his home, which require police involvement, future \nproblems and disturbances are likely to recur, AG \u00b6 17(d) does not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. However, I also considered that he has a nearly 20-year relationship with FS \nthat routinely requires police involvement and has included multiple arrests for domestic \ndisturbances. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s poor decision to allow FS to remain residing in \nhis home will likely result in continued domestic disturbances requiring police \ninvolvement. Although the criminal conduct and alcohol consumption concerns are \nmitigated, Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs   1.a \u2013 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph     2.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs   2.b \u2013 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph     2.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph     3.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Berry, Esq. \n \n11/26/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse). Applicant has used marijuana on three occasions since 2014, \nspecifically in August 2014, July 2015, and October 2017. His last use was in a foreign \ncountry where marijuana is legally sold and used. He held an active security clearance in \n2015 and 2017. Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation was insufficient to mitigate security \nconcerns raised by his conduct. Based upon the record evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is revoked. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 22, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) to \nrenew his previously granted clearance. On January 2, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline H. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, \n1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n\n2 \n \nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 2, 2019, admitting both of the SOR \nallegations with additional comments in mitigation. He requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On July 17, \n2019, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 6, \n2019, scheduling the hearing on September 26, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered three \ndocuments, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel offered eight documents, which were marked by Applicant\u2019s counsel as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H. All exhibits were admitted into the record without \nobjection. I marked the Government\u2019s Exhibit List as Hearing Exhibit 1 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit List as Hearing Exhibit 2. I received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October \n11, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in my findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s \npersonal information is extracted from GE 2, which is his most recent security clearance \napplication, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, the hearing testimony, and the documentary \nevidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 61, has worked as an engineer for defense contractors since at least \n2001, except during the period January 2014 to April 2015 when he was laid off and then \nrehired. He has held a security clearance since 1983, with the exception of a short period \nwithout a clearance about 15 years ago. In 2006, he reapplied and was granted a \nclearance, when he began working in his current role. (Tr. 17-18; AE H.)  \n \n \nApplicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. He was first married in 1985. \nThat marriage ended in divorce in 2004. He remarried in 2016. He has one adult child \nfrom his first marriage and two adult stepchildren from his second marriage. (AE H.) \n \n \nOn three occasions since 2014, Applicant has smoked marijuana or consumed a \nTHC product. He also used marijuana in 2003 on one occasion. In August 2014, Applicant \nwas on vacation with his spouse in a state where the sale and use of marijuana and THC \nproducts are not illegal under state law. Applicant was given a THC candy and consumed \nit out of curiosity. He was unemployed at the time, and he understood that his clearance \nwas deactivated. The next occasion occurred in July 2015. He and his spouse were \ncamping with friends, and he smoked a marijuana cigarette along with the others. He was \naware that his clearance had been reactivated at that time, following his rehiring in April \n2015. The most recent incident occurred in October 2017 while Applicant was on vacation \nin a foreign country where the purchase and use of marijuana is legal. He and his spouse \n\n3 \n \npurchased a marijuana cigarette in a so-called \u201ccoffee shop\u201d and smoked it on two \noccasions while in the foreign country. (SOR response at 1-2; Tr. 21-30; GE 3 at 8.) \n \n \nIn April 2017, Applicant prepared the SCA and disclosed his drug use on the prior \ntwo occasions. He noted that the August 2014 usage occurred during a time he was \nunemployed and his clearance was not active. The July 2015 usage occurred just three \nmonths after he was rehired into a position that required a security clearance. \nNevertheless, he denied in his April 2017 SCA that he had ever used illegal drugs while \nholding a security clearance, although he disclosed his use elsewhere in the illegal drug \nsection of the SCA, as noted.  \n \n \nApplicant also checked a box in his SCA indicating that he did not intend to use \nthe drug in the future. As an explanation in support of this stated intent, he wrote that he \nrecognized that it was an illegal drug under federal law and that usage could have \n\u201cdeleterious health effects Regarding (sic) security clearance.\u201d Notwithstanding that \nrepresentation, he proceeded to use marijuana again in October 2017. At the hearing, he \nexplained that his logic in using marijuana at the time was that he was on vacation in a \nforeign country where the drug was legal and his security clearance obligations \u201ccould \nsomehow be set aside for an evening on vacation [in a foreign country.]\u201d He conceded \nthat his thinking was flawed and incorrect, and he regrets his mistake. He has learned \nthat as a holder of a security clearance, he is obligated to take steps beyond avoiding the \ndisclosure of national security matters. He has not used any illegal drugs in the last two \nyears. (Tr. 27-31, 38-40.) \n \n \nIn the past, Applicant did not \u201cfully understand the impact of [his] behavior\u201d on his \neligibility to hold a security clearance. He honestly disclosed his illegal drug use in his \nSCA and at his June 2018 background interview. He was surprised, though, to receive \nthe SOR advising him that his clearance was in jeopardy, even though he has been \ninvolved in government contracting with a security clearance most of his life. He now has \n\u201ca much greater understanding of the impact of breaking laws while holding a security \nclearance.\u201d (Tr. 45-52.)  \n \n \nApplicant now rarely sees his friends who were involved in the 2015 camping trip. \nHe last saw them over a year ago. He does not associate with people who use drugs \nfrequently. Applicant\u2019s spouse was with him on each of the three times Applicant used \nmarijuana in recent years. His spouse holds a job subject to drug testing and is not a \nfrequent drug user. His spouse is supportive of Applicant\u2019s decision to abstain from any \nfuture illegal drug use. (Tr. 33, 52, 55, 67-68.)  \n \n \nApplicant presented at the hearing a written statement of his intent to never use \nillegal drugs again. In his statement, he also committed to avoiding locations where illegal \ndrugs were being used. A second exhibit offered at the hearing is a letter, dated \nSeptember 23, 2019, from a licensed clinical social worker with substantial experience \ntreating drug and alcohol dependency. As of the date of the letter, the social worker had \ntreated Applicant for a period of six months. Applicant continues to be treated by the \n\n4 \n \ncounselor. The social worker concluded that Applicant has no \u201congoing urges or desires \nto use marijuana\u201d and is not addicted or dependent on marijuana. (AE A, G; Tr. 34-44.) \n \n \nThe social worker also concluded that Applicant has \u201cno clinical signs of \ndepression, anxiety, or behavioral concerns.\u201d With respect to a diagnosis, the social \nworker wrote: \n \nI \nwould \nNOT \ndiagnose \nor \nclassify \n[Applicant] \nas \nhaving \na \nCannabis/marijuana dependence or addiction. In fact, my official diagnosis \nis: \u201cF43.20, Adjustment to life stressors, Unspecified\u201d (\u201cUnspecified\u201d \nmeaning there are no clinical signs of depression, anxiety, or behavioral \nconcerns.) (Emphasis in original.) \n \n(AE G.) Applicant believe that he has now taken responsibility for his actions and has \ntaken \u201csome positive actions.\u201d (Tr. 45.) \n \n \nIn three character letters submitted by Applicant at the hearing, his professional \nand personal references attested to Applicant\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Applicant also submitted two recent performance appraisals from his current \nemployment. His performance was highly rated in both years. He has received cash \nbonus awards, a promotion, and a merit pay increase by his employer in recognition of \nhis excellent work. (Tr. 40-42; AE B through F.) \n \n \nTwo character references also testified in support of Applicant\u2019s case. One was a \nformer supervisor who has known Applicant for many years. He testified that Applicant is \nvery straightforward and transparent. The witness is \u201cvery comfortable\u201d having Applicant \nwork at their defense contractor with a security clearance. He admires Applicant\u2019s honesty \nand willingness to take responsibility for his actions. This witness also wrote AE B in \nsupport of Applicant. (Tr. 71-86.) \n \n \nA second character witness testified and provided a reference letter. She has \nknown Applicant for about 15 years through their work together and has become a social \nfriend. She is a peer of Applicant. When he was laid off, she urged her employer to \nultimately rehire him when the opportunity arose. She describes Applicant as honest, \nhardworking, knowledgeable, and dedicated. She also testified that Applicant is very \nreliable and trustworthy. (Tr. 85-92; AE C.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n\n5 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24 as follows:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response and the record evidence at the \nhearing establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline H, \nexcept his use of marijuana in October 2017, which was a legal use of a drug in a foreign \ncountry:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition [in AG \u00b6 24]);  \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n\n7 \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was infrequent, but his \nuse over a 14-year period was opportunistic, occurring when the drug happened to be \noffered to him or was readily available. The fact that he twice used marijuana while \ngranted access to classified information casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. Applicant\u2019s judgment is also called into question by his \nuse of marijuana in October 2017 after he had prepared his most recent SCA in which he \nnoted his intent not to use marijuana in the future. The fact that Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana in October 2017 was not illegal under foreign law does not materially change \nthis conclusion in light of his comment in the SCA. That mistake of judgment casts doubt \non his reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is established. Applicant sincerely acknowledges his drug involvement \nand has provided evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem. He has established \na pattern of abstinence over the past two years. He has provided a written statement \npursuant to AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) and he has a six-month track record of engaging in counseling \nrelated to his past drug use. He does not associate with drug abusers, and he rarely sees \nhis friends with whom he used marijuana in July 2015, which addresses AG \u00b6 26(b)(1). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d) is partially established. Applicant has received counseling from a \nlicensed clinical social worker for six months. This is not quite the same as a \u201cprescribed \ndrug treatment program,\u201d but his counseling is for the same purpose. The social worker\u2019s \nletter in the record (AE G) does not contain a formal prognosis, but it fair to characterize \nthe letter as viewing the likelihood of Applicant\u2019s continued abstinence favorably.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a  \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n\n8 \n \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. I have considered the important fact that Applicant disclosed his past \nuse of marijuana. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s age and maturity. He is a mature \nprofessional who should know that using marijuana is inconsistent with his work \nresponsibilities and his obligations with a security clearance. His judgment failed him on \nthree occasions since 2014, when he used marijuana opportunistically because it was \nreadily available. This raises concerns about his judgment and his control over his \nbehavior. He should have known better than to use marijuana after being granted \neligibility to access classified information. He works on a defense contract that is \nimportant to our national security, yet he did not appreciate that his work responsibilities \non behalf of the Federal Government require that he obey federal law outside of work. He \nhas provided impressive whole-person evidence from two work colleagues, as well as \nother evidence. This evidence, though, is somewhat contradicted by his actions on three \nrecent occasions.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement and substance misuse. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and  \nSubstance Misuse:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst \nApplicant, \nexcept \nas \nnoted with respect to the October \n2017 allegation \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

The SOR \nfurther informed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 3, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on July 2, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 9, \n2019, scheduling the hearing for August 13, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 4, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, but offered no Exhibits. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (TR) on August 22, 2019. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 12.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since about February of \n2016. (GX 1 at page 12.) \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct, Guideline B - Foreign Influence &  Guideline D - \nSexual Behavior \n \n \n1.a., and 2.a. From about September of 2014 and continuing, Applicant has \nprovided in excess of $41,000 in financial support to 19 foreign-national women that he \nmet through a pornographic social web site. (TR at page 15 line 10 to page 23 line 3, at \npage 28 line 10 to page 31 line 19.)  Three of these women are from Romania, three \nfrom Mexico, 13 from Colombia, and two are from Peru. (Id.) Applicant does not know if \nany of these women are foreign intelligence assets. (TR at page 32 line 3 to page 33 \nline 10.) \n \n \n1.b., 2.a., and 3.a. Applicant has electronically transmitted sexually explicit \nphotos of himself to two of the foreign-national women, noted above. (TR at page 14 \nlines 6~15, and at page 34 lines 3~13.) They know that Applicant is an American. (TR at \npage 27 line 8 to page 28 line 9.) \n \n \n1.c., 2.a., and 3.a. In 2016, Applicant traveled to Columbia to meet three of the \nforeign-national women, noted above. (TR at page 14 lines 16~23, and at page 23 line 4 \nto page 27 line 7.) He had sexual relations with two of these Colombians, and a \ncontinuing romantic relationship with one these foreign nationals. (Id.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \n\n \n4 \n \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \n \n  \nApplicant has provided significant monies, and engaged in questionable sexual \nconduct, with foreign nationals. As a result, he is vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. The evidence is sufficient to raise this disqualifying condition.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant remains vulnerable to coercion. Despite receiving an SOR noting the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns, the questionable conduct continues. This demonstrates \nquestionable judgment. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. Personal \nConduct is found against Applicant. \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n\n \n5 \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S., that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \n \n  \nApplicant has continuing, questionable conduct vis-\u00e0-vis foreign-national women.  \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation \n \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant is clearly influenced by foreign nationals. Foreign \nInfluence is found against Applicant.  \n\n \n6 \n \nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \n  \nApplicant continues his high-risk sexual relationships with foreign nationals. This \nrepresents a pattern of high-risk sexual behavior that reflects a lack of discretion or \njudgment. It also creates a vulnerability to coercion, as discussed above under \nGuideline E. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 including: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. There is nothing discreet about \nApplicant\u2019s continuing questionable conduct. This makes him susceptible to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. Sexual Behavior is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, B, and D in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant remains vulnerable to coercion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the personal \nconduct, sexual behavior, and foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nParagraph 3, Guideline D:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s \nfive alcohol-related incidents of criminal conduct over a five-year period during 2012-\n2017. It is too soon to tell if he will continue responsible use of alcohol and avoid further \nincidents resulting in citation, arrest, charge, or conviction. Accordingly, this case is \ndecided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non November 26, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on November 19, 2018, after reviewing the \napplication and the information gathered during a background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \n\n \n2 \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guidelines known as Guideline G for alcohol consumption and \nGuideline J for criminal conduct. The sole allegation under Guideline J is simply a cross-\nallegation to the matters under Guideline G.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 18, 2019. He admitted the SOR \nallegations and provided explanations in a seven-page memorandum. He also \nrequested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department \nCounsel received the case on February 11, 2019, and made a timely request for a \nhearing on February 15, 2019. (Appellate Exhibit I; Tr. 13-15)  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on April 16, 2019. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on June 12, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Both Department \nCounsel and Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits \n1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and A-H, respectively. Exhibits 2 and 3 were ruled inadmissible, and I did \nnot consider them in reaching this decision. (Tr. 22-29) Other than Applicant, no \nwitnesses testified.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. He is seeking eligibility for access to classified information \nfor his job as a program analyst for a large company in the defense industry. His formal \neducation includes a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in 2015, and he is currently pursuing \nan MBA degree. (Exhibit H) He has never married and has no children.  \n \nThe SOR alleges, and Applicant admits, five alcohol-related incidents that \nresulted in citation, arrest, charge, or conviction over a five-year period during 2012-\n2017. (Exhibits 1, 4-8, and Exhibits A and B) He also described the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding each incident in his hearing testimony. These matters are \ndiscussed briefly below. \n \nThe first two incidents, essentially underage drinking, occurred in 2012 when he \nwas a 19-year-old college student. In April 2012 he was cited by university police for \ncriminal damage and minor with alcohol in body after an incident where he seriously cut \nhis wrist on broken glass from his dorm-room window. (Exhibit 6) He pleaded guilty, was \nplaced on a diversion program, and was required to attend an alcohol-education class. \nAbout seven months later in December 2012, while still age 19, he drank alcohol at a \nparty and was subsequently one of several passengers in a car that was stopped by the \npolice. The police officer smelled alcohol and required everyone, since they were \nminors, to take a breathalyzer test. He received a citation for minor with alcohol in the \nbody. He pleaded guilty, paid a small fine, and was required to attend another alcohol-\neducation class. \n \nThe third incident occurred about two years later in August 2014 when he was a \n21-year-old college student. He spent the night in jail after he was arrested for the \noffenses of public nuisance-obstruction of property and failure to obey a police officer. \n\n \n3 \n \nThe incident occurred when he was walking home under the influence of alcohol after \nattending a social gathering at a bar with fellow interns who were celebrating the end of \ntheir internships at a large, well-known financial services firm. He was represented by a \npublic defender, he pleaded guilty to the public nuisance offense, and he was ordered to \npay a $250 fine. \n \nThe fourth incident occurred less than a year later in April 2015, shortly before he \ngraduated from college at age 22. He was arrested and charged with the felony offense \nof aggravated assault of a peace officer (non-serious injury) based on spitting in the \nofficer\u2019s face. (Exhibit 7) This incident stems from an evening at a restaurant with his \nthen girlfriend and other friends. He and his girlfriend returned to her apartment where \nthey had a noisy disagreement that caused someone to call the police. He was initially \ndetained by the police while walking home to his nearby apartment.  \n \nThe police report described Applicant as quite intoxicated; his speech was \nslurred; the odor of alcohol was strong; the effects of alcohol were obvious; his attitude \nwas combative; and he was wearing blue jeans without a shirt. (Exhibit 7) The police \nreport further described him as failing to follow instructions to remain seated on the \ncurb; demanding to know what he was being charged with; cursing and insulting the \npolice officer; and then spitting in the officer\u2019s face striking the officer on the right cheek \nbone below the eye. At the hearing, Applicant stated that he spat in the direction of the \nofficer. (Tr. 48) In his November 2017 security clearance application, he explained that \nhe \u201caccidentally spat in the direction of another person with no foul intentions.\u201d (Exhibit \n1) At the hearing, he explained his characterization of the spitting incident as \n\u201caccidental\u201d was due to oversight, an explanation I find to be not credible. (Tr. 75-78)  \n \nWith assistance of counsel, Applicant pleaded guilty to attempted assault. The \ncourt sentenced him to serve probation for 18 months and attend alcohol-education \nclasses. In September 2016, the state court terminated his probation after 12 months \nand ordered that the case be designated a misdemeanor. (Exhibit A)  \n \nThe fifth incident occurred in June 2017 when he was 24 years old and had been \nworking for his current employer for about a year. He was arrested for driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol (DUI) and criminal damage after crashing his car into a cinder-block \nwall near his home. (Exhibit 8) After failing a series of field sobriety tests, he refused to \ntake a preliminary breath test. He did submit to a blood alcohol test at the police station. \nThe police report described, among other things, that Applicant initially ignored the \ncommands of and walked away from a police officer, resulting in the officer grabbing \nhim \u201cby the arm and neck area and escort[ing] him to the ground by pulling him \ndownwards\u201d and handcuffing him behind his back. (Exhibit 8, page 13 of 16) \n \nApplicant reported the incident to his employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO). \n(Exhibit 5) The final adverse information report indicates he was charged with failure to \nnotify owner or person in charge of striking a fixture; DUI based on liquor, drugs, or \nvapors; criminal damage; DUI liquor BAC .08 or more; and DUI extreme BAC .15 - .19. \nWith assistance of counsel, he pleaded guilty to a DUI offense to the slightest degree at \nor around .08 BAC. The court imposed a fine and sentenced him to serve 30 days in jail \n\n \n4 \n \nwith 28 days suspended. He served 48 hours in a short-term holding facility. The court \nalso imposed probation for 12 months and required an alcohol/substance abuse \nevaluation. He attended and completed 16-hours of level-two DUI education in October \n2017. (Exhibit E) He attended and completed a MADD victim-impact panel in November \n2017. (Exhibit D) He attended and completed a traffic-survival school in December \n2017. (Exhibit C) He did not recall if he had received any type of diagnosis regarding his \nuse of alcohol. (Tr. 55-56) In May 2018, less than a year from his DUI arrest, the court \ngranted Applicant\u2019s application and motion to set aside the judgment and conviction for \nDUI. (Exhibit B; Tr. 55)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant took full responsibility for his alcohol-related offenses \nand acknowledged a serious lack of judgment. (Tr. 38) He expressed remorse for his \nmisconduct and a desire to learn from those experiences so they do not recur. (Tr. 38-\n39) He stated that the last 24 months were a \u201ctransformational period\u201d in his life, as he \nis working to develop good judgment and sound decision-making skills. (Tr. 39) His \nultimate goal is to abstain from alcohol given the difficulties it has caused him. (Tr. 58) \nHe stated his recent use of alcohol as occurring on May 23, 2018, May 5, 2018, and the \nend of March 2018, noting that he can count on one hand how many times he had used \nalcohol in the past six months. (Tr. 56) He has a strategy or plan to avoid situations \nwhere alcohol is served, and also strictly limiting himself to no more than one alcoholic \ndrink. (Tr. 56) And he will not consume any alcohol if he is driving an automobile. (Tr. \n56-57) \n \nApplicant has a good employment record. (Exhibits F, G, and H) For example, \nhis current supervisor described him as conscientious, diligent, motivated, self-driven, \nhonest, forthright, dependable, and mature. (Exhibit H) Applicant is an active participant \nin community activities as a volunteer. (Exhibit H) He also submitted several highly \nfavorable letters of recommendation on his behalf. (Exhibits F and H)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n5 \n \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nThe alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns are discussed \ntogether, because they are based on the same five alcohol-related incidents. Under \nGuideline G for alcohol consumption, the suitability of an applicant may be questioned \nor put into doubt because, as set forth in AG \u00b6 21, excessive alcohol consumption often \nlead to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and it \ncan raise questions about a person reliability and trustworthiness. Likewise, under \nGuideline J for criminal conduct, the suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put \ninto doubt when that applicant has a history of involvement with criminal conduct. The \noverall concern as set forth in AG \u00b6 30 is aptly put: \u201cBy its very nature, [criminal conduct] \ncalls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d  \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; \n                                                          \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \n \nThe key facts here are not in dispute. Applicant was involved in five alcohol-\nrelated incidents of criminal conduct over a five-year period. The last incident, the DUI \noffense, was adjudicated in 2017 and concluded with the court setting aside the DUI \nconviction in May 2018, about 13 months before the hearing in this case. All the \nincidents involved alcohol, the last of which resulted in damage to private property, his \nand others. Three of the incidents involved behavior where Applicant was belligerent, \ndisobedient, or disrespectful (or all three) when interacting with police officers. In the \n2015 incident, in which he was quite intoxicated, Applicant spat in the face of the police \nofficer, which I find to be despicable behavior. The disqualifying conditions noted above \napply.  \n \n \nApplicant presented a decent case in mitigation. I took into consideration all the \nevidence in mitigation, including his explanations for the five alcohol-related incidents as \nwell as the evidence of rehabilitation. The evidence of reform and rehabilitation includes \nhigher education (the current MBA program), his good employment record, his favorable \nreferences, his self-report of the 2017 DUI, and the passage of time since the June \n2017 DUI incident without recurrence of criminal activity. He also reduced and modified \nhis consumption of alcohol with the ultimate goal to abstain. And he demonstrated some \ninsight and self-reflection concerning his circumstances.  \n \n \nNevertheless, the frequency and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related \nincidents weigh heavily against him. Multiple incidents of alcohol-related criminal \n\n \n7 \n \nconduct over a five-year period are obviously problematic because they demonstrate a \npattern of behavior, suggesting another alcohol-related incident is likely to recur. In \naddition, his last two alcohol-related incidents, in 2015 and 2017, were neither minor nor \ntrivial matters. His disrespectful attitude toward police officers is troubling and speaks \nvolumes. Taken together, the evidence of Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct \ncalls into question his current ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. It also calls into question his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSimply stated, it is too soon to tell if he will continue responsible use of alcohol and \nconduct himself as a law-abiding person.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied the two SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a) with mitigating comments. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He received his high school diploma in 1997, and completed some college courses between 2003 and 2005, but did not earn a degree. He enlisted in the Army in 1997; served honorably on active duty between 1998 and 2001; and in the Inactive Reserve between 2001 and 2005. Applicant married his wife in 2000. They have a son, who is almost two years old. Applicant has been working for federal contractors since he was discharged from active duty in 2001. He held a top-secret clearance between October 2011 and June 2017. He was laid off from his job in June 2017 as a result of the SOR allegations. He seeks the reinstatement of his clearance eligibility, which is required for his employment with a federal contractor. Applicant\u2019s security concerns arose because of his inappropriate use of web services. In February and, in particular, on April 28, 2017, a computer program alerted Applicant\u2019s agency\u2019s computer network defense (CND) team of his repeated access to multiple pornographic images and inappropriate content.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant was the subject of a Security Access Eligibility Report (SAER) for \ninappropriate use of web services, dated May 15, 2017. He submitted his most recent \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) on July 14, 2017. He was interviewed by \ngovernment investigators on April 16, 2018, and answered a set of interrogatories from \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on February 23, 2019. After \nreviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on April 4, 2019, alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct) and M (use of information \ntechnology). Applicant answered the SOR on May 8, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore a DOHA administrative judge.  \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on August 2, 2019, and issued a notice of \nhearing on August 13, 2019, setting the hearing for September 12, 2019. At the hearing, \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nthe Government offered four exhibits (GE 1 through 4). GE 1, 2, and 4 were admitted \ninto the record without any objections. Applicant\u2019s objection to GE 3 (that the document \nwas incomplete because it did not specify the number of times the adult sites were \naccessed) was overruled, and I admitted the document as evidence. Applicant testified \non his own behalf and presented the testimony of two witnesses and four character \nstatements, all of which I admitted into the record without any objections. I marked the \nGovernment\u2019s discovery letter as Hearing Exhibit 1. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on September 20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the two SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a) with mitigating \ncomments. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following findings \nof fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He received his high \nschool diploma in 1997, and completed some college courses between 2003 and 2005, \nbut did not earn a degree. He enlisted in the Army in 1997; served honorably on active \nduty between 1998 and 2001; and in the Inactive Reserve between 2001 and 2005. \nApplicant married his wife in 2000. They have a son, who is almost two years old.   \n \nApplicant has been working for federal contractors since he was discharged from \nactive duty in 2001. He held a top-secret clearance between October 2011 and June \n2017. He was laid off from his job in June 2017 as a result of the SOR allegations. He \nseeks the reinstatement of his clearance eligibility, which is required for his employment \nwith a federal contractor. \n \nApplicant\u2019s security concerns arose because of his inappropriate use of web \nservices. In February and, in particular, on April 28, 2017, a computer program alerted \nApplicant\u2019s agency\u2019s computer network defense (CND) team of his repeated access to \nmultiple pornographic images and inappropriate content. An investigation into \nApplicant\u2019s web traffic patterns for April 2017 identified the inappropriate web sites he \nvisited and images he accessed. Additionally, the investigation found saved in \nApplicant\u2019s computer inappropriate images and a sexually explicit conversation with a \nco-worker. (GE 3)  \n \nApplicant denied that he inappropriately used his employer\u2019s government \ninformation technology system to view inappropriate content. He admitted that his \ncommon access card (CAC) was used to access the inappropriate sites, but claimed \nthat he left his CAC in his computer when going to meetings or the bathroom, and that \nco-workers must have accessed the improper sites without his knowledge to get him in \ntrouble.  \n \nApplicant presented the testimony of a co-worker (F) to show that other \nemployees had accessed her computer and used it to send unwanted email messages \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nto others as a joke when she went to the bathroom. She explained that the computers \nwere old and failed to log you out immediately. Applicant believes that the same \nhappened to him, and someone accessed the improper sites when he was not at his \ncomputer. However, his beliefs are unsubstantiated. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant admitted that he entered into an inappropriate email \nconversation with a co-worker, and that he saved a copy of the email correspondence in \nhis computer. He acknowledged his lack of judgment and expressed sincere remorse \nfor his behavior. \n \nApplicant\u2019s references (supervisors and co-workers) are impressive. They attest \nto Applicant\u2019s professionalism and unwavering moral character. They consider Applicant \nto have unique analytical skills, knowledge, and a strong sense of team work. He \nconsistently outperform his co-workers with quality products through sound research \nskills and attention to detail. He is considered to be the top one-percent producer, and a \ncritical member of the organization analytical production team. He demonstrated strong \nleadership and was appointed as the site lead. He excelled mentoring junior analysts \nand providing training. Because of his outstanding contributions he was appointed \nsenior analyst.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s references are aware of the SOR allegations. They found the \nbehavior completely out of character for someone with Applicant\u2019s 20-year of proven \nperformance record. They recommended Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for a \nclearance. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . .  \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes that between February and April 2017, \nApplicant inappropriately used his employer\u2019s government information technology \nsystem to view inappropriate content, and that he engaged in inappropriate explicit \ncorrespondence with a co-worker on a government system. Applicant\u2019s behavior raises \nthe following disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . .  \n \n \nThe record established the above disqualifying condition, requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of the mitigating conditions. I considered the \nfollowing mitigating conditions set forth by AG \u00b6 17 as partially raised by the evidence: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nAfter analyzing the above mitigating conditions in light of the record evidence as \na whole, I find that they are not applicable and do not mitigate the personal conduct \nconcerns. Considering Applicant\u2019s service and professional experience, I cannot find his \nbehavior a minor offense. Because of his work experience and leadership position, he \nknew it was inappropriate to use government equipment to access inappropriate \ninformation or content on the Internet. Similarly, I consider his questionable behavior \nrecent and frequent (although limited to a two-month period). I also find that Applicant\u2019s \nquestionable behavior still casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \n \nI carefully considered Applicant\u2019s assertion that, unbeknown to him, co-workers \nwho wanted to harm him, used his CAC card to access and view inappropriate sites and \ncontent. In light of the information technology investigation report, I find Applicant\u2019s \ncontentions not persuasive or credible. The investigation report is extensive, detailed, \nand specific as to the multiple number of sites and inappropriate content that Applicant \naccessed. Applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s evidence.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegations against him and he has not participated in \ncounseling. AG \u00b6 17(d) is not applicable. Considering the evidence as a whole, I find \nthat the Guideline E allegations continue to raise concerns under AG \u00b6 16(e), which are \nnot mitigated. \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology  \n \nAG \u00b6 39 describes the security concern for use of information technology: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n \nUnder Guideline M, the SOR cross-alleged the same facts and circumstances \nalleged under Guideline E. For the sake of brevity, the facts, analysis, and conclusions \noutlined under Guideline E are incorporated herein without repeating them. \n \nAG \u00b6 40 lists a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \n \n \nBetween February and April 2017, Applicant used his employer\u2019s government \ninformation technology system to view inappropriate content, and he engaged in \ninappropriate explicit correspondence with a co-worker. Because of his training, service, \nand professional experience, Applicant knew that accessing inappropriate sites and \ncontent through government equipment was prohibited under security rules and \nprocedures. He acknowledged he displayed lack of judgment when he engaged in \ninappropriate explicit correspondence with a co-worker. AG \u00b6 40(e) is established.  \n \nAG \u00b6 41 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \n \nFor the same reasons stated under Guideline E, incorporated herein, Applicant \nfailed to submit sufficient evidence to mitigate the use of information technology \nsystems security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E \nand M in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant, 40, honorably served in the U.S. military. He has been employed with \nfederal contractors since he was discharged from the service in 2001. He held a \nclearance, at least between 2001 and 2017, without any security incidents of concern, \nexcept for the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s references\u2019 statements in support of him are impressive. They attest \nto his professionalism and unwavering moral character. He is considered to have \nunique analytical skills, knowledge, and a strong sense of team work. He consistently \noutperform his co-workers with quality products through sound research skills and \nattention to detail. He is considered to be the top one-percent producer, and a critical \nmember of his organization\u2019s analytical production team. He demonstrated strong \nleadership and was appointed as the site lead and senior analyst. Applicant\u2019s \nreferences are aware of the SOR allegations. They found the behavior completely out of \ncharacter. They recommended Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for a clearance.  \n \nNevertheless, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a \nsecurity clearance. Unmitigated security concerns lead me to conclude that granting a \nsecurity clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His request for continued security clearance eligibility is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn December 5, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain or renew eligibility for a security clearance \nrequired for his employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense (DOD) could not \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \nto have a security clearance.1 \n \n \nOn November 9, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial considerations \n(Guideline F). Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing.  \n \n \nI received the case on March 11, 2019, and convened the requested hearing on \nApril 18, 2019. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 9. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) \nA \u2013 C. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I received a transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on May 6, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant owed the IRS $13,500 for \nunpaid taxes from the 2012 and 2017 tax years (SOR 1.a); that he failed to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2017 (SOR 1.b); and his state \nincome tax returns for the tax years 2016 and 2017 (SOR 1.d). It was further alleged that \nApplicant owed $1,314.66 for past-due state income taxes for the 2014 tax year pursuant \nto a tax lien filed against him in April 2018 (SOR 1.c); that he owed $12,963 for six \ndelinquent or past-due commercial debts (SOR 1.e \u2013 1.j); and that on August 29, 2018, \nhe filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection through a petition that was still pending \napproval as of the issuance of the SOR (SOR 1.k). \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, the SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j \nallegations. As to SOR 1.k, Applicant denied the allegation, averring that the Chapter 13 \npetition was confirmed on November 9, 2018 and that he was making payments as \nrequired under the trustee\u2019s plan. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. After he graduated from high school in June 1991, he \njoined the U.S. Navy where he served as a machinist\u2019s mate until receiving an honorable \ndischarge in June 1997. He is seeking to renew a security clearance he received in 2011. \nWhen he submitted his e-QIP in December 2017, he disclosed the fact that he had not \ntimely filed his federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2016; that he had not yet filed \nhis 2016 state income tax returns; and that he owed the debts alleged at SOR 1.e \u2013 1.i. \n(GX 1; Tr. 6, 74) \n \n \nApplicant was married from June 1993 until divorcing in October 2008. He has six \nchildren, some with his ex-wife and some outside the marriage, ranging in age from 5 to \n28. Applicant is paying child support only for his youngest child. Since May 2002, \nApplicant has lived with his mother, who has a variety of medical conditions. He helps \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \npay the rent and other expenses, and he is her primary care giver. (GX 1; Tr. 6 \u2013 7, 15 \u2013 \n16, 39 \u2013 41, 65, 74 \u2013 75) \n \n \nApplicant has worked as a warehouse specialist for two different companies since \nMay 2006. He was laid off in July 2014 when his employer lost its federal contract. \nApplicant resumed working in December 2014 and remained employed as a procurement \nspecialist until April 2017, when he again was laid off for one month after a lost contract. \nApplicant has been steadily employed since May 2017. His average monthly income has \nbeen $3,000. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 33 \u2013 37)  \n \n \nBetween 2013, when his youngest child was born, and 2016, Applicant was \nactively involved with the child\u2019s mother in caring for and supporting the child. He often \ntook the child to and from daycare, and cared for the child where the mother lived; \nhowever, Applicant has only seen his child once in the last two-and-one-half years. In \n2016, the child\u2019s mother demanded financial support from Applicant. Applicant responded \nby requesting a DNA test to verify his paternity. That request meant that he was not \nobligated to make payments pending the results, which were positive. Applicant became \nobligated to make monthly child support payments beginning in March 2017, including an \narrearage that accrued while the DNA test was pending. Between 2016 and 2018, the \nmother of Applicant\u2019s youngest child instituted multiple court hearings seeking \nmodification of Applicant\u2019s child support payments. Between 2016 and 2018, Applicant \nhas had to appear in at least eight such hearings, and only recently was able to finalize a \nchild support requirement of $504 each month. The payments are made from his bi-\nweekly paychecks at a rate of $232.61. (Answer; GX 2; GX 9; Tr. 45, 58 \u2013 59, 77 \u2013 78, \n81 \u2013 85) \n \n \nFor the tax years 2012 through 2015, the grandmother of the mother of Applicant\u2019s \nyoungest child prepared and filed Applicant\u2019s federal and state tax returns. After initially \nreceiving refunds for those years, Applicant was notified in 2017 that mistakes had been \nmade in those tax returns and that Applicant actually owed about $8,000. The amount \nreferenced in SOR 1.a is the result of interest and penalties. Applicant did not timely file \nhis 2016 federal income tax returns because he could not obtain his W-2 form from the \nemployer who laid him off in April 2017. He also delayed resolving his 2016 filing because \nhe was often involved in court hearings for child support. The same was true for his late \nfiling of his 2017 tax returns in 2018. By that time, Applicant was consulting with his \nbankruptcy attorney who advised Applicant the attorney would file the return as part of \nhis bankruptcy services. All of Applicant\u2019s past-due income tax returns have been filed. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 6; HX 9; Tr. 46 \u2013 58, 78 \u2013 80, 85 \u2013 87) \n \n \nApplicant incurred the debts addressed at SOR 1.e \u2013 1.j as a result of financial \nchallenges that began when he was laid off in 2014. Applicant has acknowledged that he \nwas not properly managing his finances at the time. To resolve his federal income tax \ndebt, Applicant entered into a monthly repayment plan with the IRS in February 2018. \nApplicant agreed to pay $146 each month; however, before he could start making \npayments, he was sidetracked by additional child support hearings. The same was true \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nas he tried to negotiate repayment of his other past-due debts directly with his creditors. \nUntil Applicant knew how much he had to pay in child support, he could not commit to \nregular payments. After March 2018, Applicant knew how much he had to pay in child \nsupport, so he resumed his communications with his creditors. The payments they \ndemanded, even in settlement, exceeded what he could reasonably pay each month. \nApplicant contacted a bankruptcy attorney in July 2018 and filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection in August 2018 to resolve his debts. All of the debts alleged in the \nSOR, including the state and federal income tax debts, are included in Applicant\u2019s petition. \nA repayment plan was approved in November 2018, and as of his hearing, Applicant had \nmade the first seven of his plan\u2019s 60 payments. Applicant is resolving his child support \narrearage and his tax debts through $470 monthly payments under the bankruptcy plan. \nHis bankruptcy and child support payments are paid as direct allotments from his \npaycheck. (Answer; GX 2; GX 6; AX A \u2013 C; Tr. 41 \u2013 45, 79) \n \n \n Appellant\u2019s current finances are stable. After all of his monthly expenses, including \nhis child support and bankruptcy payments, he has a positive monthly cash flow. \nAppellant has not incurred any new debts, and he has reduced his personal expenses \nliving with his mother and closely managing his money. When Appellant first applied for \na security clearance in 2009, he had other past-due debts that were addressed in that \nbackground investigation. Applicant resolved those debts in a timely manner. His \npersonal and professional circumstances have improved, and he now has a better \nawareness of how to manage his personal finances. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 60 \u2013 61, 65 \u2013 69, \n70 \u2013 73) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,2 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) \nof the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n                                                 \n2 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n3 The current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, \n2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5 A person who has access \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant failed to file some of his state and \nfederal income tax returns as required, and that he incurred the delinquent tax and other \ndebts alleged in the SOR. That information reasonably raised a security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s finances that is articulated generally at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n                                                 \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n6 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nMore specifically, available information supported application of the disqualifying \nconditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired). \n \nBy contrast, Applicant established that his financial problems, as well as his failure \nto meet his tax return filing obligations, arose from events and circumstances beyond his \ncontrol that are not likely to recur. Applicant\u2019s federal tax debt arose from errors made by \nthe person who prepared his tax returns. Additionally, Appellant\u2019s period of \nunemployment in 2014 came at a time when he still had multiple child support obligations. \nSince then, Applicant has been consistently employed and he now has only one child \nsupport payment. Applicant\u2019s inability to address his tax debts was repeatedly interrupted \nby ongoing child support hearings that are now completed.  \n \nOnce those issues were settled, Applicant could not negotiate affordable \nresolutions with his private creditors and elected to resolve all of his debts, including his \ntax debts and a child support arrearage, through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment \nplan. Under the circumstances, this was a timely and reasonable course of action. As of \nhis hearing, Applicant had made the first seven payments required by the bankruptcy plan \nand his regular child support payments have been allotted directly from his bi-weekly pay. \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s income tax returns have been filed, and he is in good standing \non all of his current obligations. His monthly finances are sound, he has a positive monthly \ncash flow, and he has not incurred any new delinquent or past-due debts. All of the \nforegoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude the record as a whole is sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the Government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s finances. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s response to adverse financial circumstances reflects well on his \njudgment and reliability. A fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as \na whole shows the security concerns about his finances are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

He did not mitigate the resulting financial \nsecurity concerns. National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 21, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. Applicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on January 19, 2019, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nOn April 5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned \nthe case to me. On May 6, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for \nMay 29, 2019. The case was heard as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into evidence. Applicant testified and offered \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through F into evidence. All exhibits were admitted. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 13, 2019.  \n \nThe record remained open until June 15, 2019, to give Applicant an opportunity to \nsubmit additional evidence. He timely submitted proof of payment of a delinquent debt \nthat I marked as AE G, and admitted into the record without objection. I extended that \ndeadline to June 19, 2019, based on Applicant\u2019s representations that he was waiting for \nadditional evidence. He again timely submitted an additional exhibit that I marked as AG \nH, and admitted into the record without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.j. 1.k, and 1.l. He \ndenied the allegations SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, and stated he paid these debts. \nHis admissions are incorporated into these findings.  \n \n \nApplicant is 25 years old. He graduated from high school in 2012. He has two \nchildren, ages three and four, with a former girlfriend. They live in another state. Since \nOctober 2017, he has lived with his fianc\u00e9e, who is pregnant with their child. (Tr. 22-23, \n25-26)   \n \n \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant went to work for local retail \ncompanies. In May 2013, he began a position with a private company. He worked there \nuntil April 2015, when he voluntarily resigned his position after a dispute with his employer \nand moved to another state to be with his two children. He obtained another job in the \nnew state at a lesser salary and worked there until July 2016, when he was in an \nautomobile accident. He was unable to return to work until September 2017. He then \nmoved back to his former state and worked as a private driver. In April 2018, he started \na position with a federal contractor. He has also attended technical school. (Tr. 23-25; GE \n1) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to  the following: factors: quitting his \nposition in April 2015; moving to another state; being unable to find a good paying job \nthere; and  the long period of unemployment he experienced after his automobile accident \nin July 2016. (Tr. 26) He admitted that he exercised poor judgment when he resigned his \nposition and moved to another state where his children lived, without having another job. \n(Tr. 60)   \n \n \nBased on a credit bureau report (CBR) from April 2018, the SOR alleged 12 debts \nthat became delinquent between 2014 and 2017, and totaled $29,554. The status of each \ndebt is as follows: \n \n  \n1. (1.a) The $14,314 charged-off automobile loan is unresolved. The last payment \nApplicant made on the car loan was in March 2015, a month before he resigned \nhis job. He said he voluntarily returned the car. The original loan was more than \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n$20,000. He explained that he is paying collection debts before resolving \ncharged-off accounts. (Tr. 34-36) \n  \n \n2. (1.b) The $130 debt owed to an insurance company for car insurance was paid \nin April 2018. It is resolved. (Tr. 36; AE A at 7)  \n \n3. (1.c) The $599 debt owed to a cable company was paid in August 2018. It is \nresolved. (Tr. 37; AE A at 7) \n \n4. (1.d) The $662 debt owed to a retail store is unresolved. The account was \nclosed in June 2015. Applicant more recently called the creditor to settle the \naccount for a lesser amount but was unsuccessful. The creditor wants the full \namount. It is unresolved. (Tr. 38)  \n \n5. (1.e) The $660 debt owed to a wireless company was paid in March 2019. It is \nresolved. Applicant used some of his $1,200 tax refund from 2018 to pay this \ndebt. (Tr. 39; AE B)  \n \n6. (1.f) The $4,088 debt owed to a creditor for an unpaid loan is unresolved. \nApplicant stopped paying the debt in March 2015. He had been paying it for \nabout a year. The creditor will not take payments on the debt or settle it for less \nthan $4,088. (Tr. 40-42) \n \n7. (1.g) The medical debt for $222 was paid by Applicant\u2019s lawyer after his \nautomobile accident in 2016. It is resolved. (Tr. 42; AE H) \n \n8. (I.h) The medical debt for $399 was paid by Applicant\u2019s lawyer after his \nautomobile accident in 2016. It is resolved. (Tr. 43; AE G)  \n \n9. (1.i) The medical debt for $125 is paid. (Tr. 44-45; AE C)  \n \n10. (1.j) The $1,115 debt owed to a credit card company is unpaid. Applicant\u2019s last \npayment was in March 2015. (Tr. 45-46)  \n \n11. (1.k) The $3,452 debt owed to a creditor for a personal loan is unresolved. \nApplicant obtained the loan to pay off debts in February 2015. He made \npayments on the loan until May 2015. The creditor recently agreed to settle it \nfor $1,200, but he cannot afford that amount currently. (Tr. 46-49)   \n12. (1.l) Applicant owes his former employer $3,788 for personal expenses he \ncharged to his employer\u2019s credit card while traveling for his job. It also includes \nabout $1,200 for tools and materials he purchased to use for his employer\u2019s \nproject from October to December 2014. He said his supervisor gave him \nauthorization to use the credit card to purchase the tools he needed. He said \nhe had routinely put personal expenses on the credit card and paid them when \npayment was due. He knew he was not supposed to use the travel card for \n\n \n \n \n \n4\npersonal expenses, but he had done so in the past without a problem because \nhe promptly paid his personal expenses when he received the credit card \nstatement. He acknowledged that some of the personal expenses he put on \nthe card were to purchase alcohol in a bar. He received reimbursement for the \nauthorized expenses on the card, but not for the tools or his personal expenses. \nHe quit this job in April 2015, as noted above, without having paid the credit \ncard debt. (Tr. 50-58, 77-78; AE D) \n \nThe credit card balance is now $4,039. Applicant began making monthly \npayments of $289 in February 2019. He intends to have the debt paid in \nDecember 2020. The debt is slowly being resolved. (AE D)      \n \n \nApplicant earns $53,000 annually. He pays $500 a month in child support for his \ntwo children. He uses an online app to keep track of his income and expenses. He does \nnot owe federal or state taxes. He has been making monthly payments of $90 on a $632 \ndelinquent loan debt not alleged in the SOR. He has not taken a budget or credit \ncounseling course, but has had help from his mother, who teaches budgeting and \nfinancial planning at a university. (Tr. 29-30, 32-34, 73-74; AE F) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a letter of recommendation from his supervisor, who strongly \nsupports Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. He relies on Applicant when he is \nout of the office. He said Applicant is a \u201ctrustworthy individual.\u201d (AE C)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of being unable to satisfy his debts that began in 2014 and \ncontinued into 2018, when he started to resolve them. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out conditions that could potentially mitigate those \nfinancial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been ongoing for at least three years before he \nbegan to address them. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nsignificantly increased in mid-2015, after he quit his job, which Applicant admitted was a \npoor decision, and a circumstance within his control. Between 2016 and 2017, he was \nunable to work because he was in a serious automobile accident, which was a \ncircumstance beyond his control. He did not attempt to responsibly manage the \ndelinquent debts until he began the security clearance process. The evidence establishes \nsome mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \nApplicant received credit or financial counseling from his mother, a financial \nplanner. He has paid six debts, totaling $2,135, demonstrating that those debts are under \ncontrol. He initiated a good-faith effort to resolve the $3,788 credit card debt owed to his \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nformer employer through monthly payments. He established mitigation as to those seven \ndebts under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant testified candidly and forthrightly while discussing his delinquent debts. \nHe admitted that he made a poor financial decision in April 2015 when he chose to resign \nfrom his job without having found another one in the state where he intended to move. As \na consequence of that and an unfortunate accident, he was subsequently unable to pay \nnumerous financial obligations that he had assumed. In 2018, he began to slowly resolve \nthem. To date, he has paid or resolved seven of the twelve debts totaling $5,923. He has \nbeen unable to financially address the remaining five debts that total $23,631. While he \nis establishing a track record of responsibly managing his debts, he has not fully mitigated \nthe security concerns raised under the financial considerations guideline. The record \nevidence leaves me with some doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance at this time.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n    \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n        Subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c:  \n \n        For Applicant  \n \n        Subparagraph 1.d: \n \n \n \n        Against Applicant \n \n        Subparagraph 1.e: \n \n \n \n        For Applicant \n \n        Subparagraph 1.f: \n \n \n \n        Against Applicant \n \n        Subparagraphs 1.g through 1.i: \n \n        For Applicant \n \n        Subparagraphs 1.j and 1.k:  \n                 Against Applicant \n \n        Subparagraph 1.l: \n \n \n \n        For Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986). \n2 See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for \nadministrative notice). \n3 Items 3, 5. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \nApplicant remains a dual citizen of the United States and Russia. He looked into \nrenouncing his Russian citizenship, but declined to pursue that effort because of the \namount of time it would take him to do so. He offered that he would do so if it was \nrequired of him. He previously held a Russian passport, which expired in 2008. He \ncurrently possesses a U.S. passport issued in 2016. Because Applicant chose to have \nhis case decided based solely on the written record, I was unable to judge his \ndemeanor and credibility in reaching this decision.4 \nForeign Influence \nApplicant has the following relatives who are residents and citizens of Russia:  \n1. His mother. His mother is 78 years old. She is retired from her position at a \nhospital. She is not affiliated with the government or the military. Applicant is very close \nto his mother and tries to have weekly telephone contact with her.5 \n2. His father. His father is 85 years old. He is retired from his position at a \nchildren\u2019s education center. He is not affiliated with the government or the military. \nApplicant is very close to his father and tries to have weekly telephone contact with \nhim.6 \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant presented letters and citations describing his outstanding work in 2001\u00ad\n2003. He set up systems networks for DOD projects and was recognized for his \ninitiative, professionalism, and effectiveness.7 \nAdministrative Notice-Russia. \nRussia has a highly centralized, weak multi-party political system dominated by \nthe president. Russia has significant human-rights problems, marked by restrictions on \ncivil liberties, discrimination, denial of due process, forced confessions, torture, other \nprisoner mistreatment, and the government\u2019s failure to prosecute officials who commit \nserious violations. Government officials also engage in electronic surveillance without \nproper authorization. \nRussia is one of the most aggressive countries conducting espionage against the \nUnited States, focusing on obtaining proprietary information and advance weapons \ntechnologies beneficial to Russia\u2019s military modernization and economic development. \n4 Items 3, 5. \n5 Items 3, 5; AE A. \n6 Items 3, 5; AE A. \n7 Item 2 (attachments thereto). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRussia\u2019s intelligence services as well as private companies and other entities frequently \nseek to exploit Russian citizens or persons with family ties to Russia who can use their \ninsider access to corporate networks to steal secrets. They also have offered financial \ninducements to U.S. government officials and citizens to encourage them to \ncompromise classified information. Russia\u2019s attempts to collect U.S. technological and \neconomic information represent a growing and persistent threat to U.S. security. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary  \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 7: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nrelationship between Russia and the United States places a significant, but not \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith his relatives living in Russia do not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be \nplaced in a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United \nStates and a desire to assist his relatives living in Russia who might be coerced by \ngovernmental entities or pressured to assist Russia.  \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Russia seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his relatives \nliving in Russia, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) \nand 7(b) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s family members who are residents and citizens \nof Russia. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s position could cause him to be placed in a \nposition to choose between the interests of his relatives and those of the United States. \nApplicant testified that he has regular contact with his relatives in Russia. AG \u00b6 8(c) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant has not met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Although he has been a U.S. citizen since 2006, \nhe also remains a citizen of Russia. His wife is a dual citizen of the United States and \nMoldova. His two children are U.S. citizens. He is apparently a homeowner in the United \nStates, but additional details about his connections to this country are lacking. He has \nweekly contact with his elderly parents in Russia. The evidence supports the conclusion \nthat Applicant has substantial ties to his parents in Russia. Because of those ties, it is \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunclear that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 \n8(b) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including his favorable character \nevidence. I also considered his ties to Russian parents are strong. The circumstances \ntending to support granting Applicant\u2019s clearance are less significant than the factors \nweighing towards denying his clearance. At this point, the evidence does not support his \nlong-standing ties and connections to the United States. Therefore, he provided \ninsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence \nconcerns were not mitigated.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST\n \nAPPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst\n \nApplicant\n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 26, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on December 11, 2018, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On January 25, 2019, he \nchanged his request to a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on February 28, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled on May \n8, 2019. Department Counsel amended the SOR at the hearing by withdrawing SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through Q, which were \nadmitted without objection. \n \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant both requested that I take administrative \nnotice of certain facts about Taiwan. Without objection, I have taken administrative \nnotice of the facts contained in the requests. The facts in the written requests will not be \nrepeated verbatim in this decision, but are summarized in the Findings of Fact, below. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. His job \nis contingent upon him receiving a security clearance. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He \nis married with one child.1 \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States to parents who had emigrated from \nTaiwan. His two siblings were also born in the United States. One sibling works for the \nU.S. military. His parents became U.S. citizens while retaining their Taiwanese \ncitizenships. Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings live in the United States.2 \n \n \nApplicant has worked for a U.S. company since 2002. His job required him to \ntravel throughout the world, and he worked for the company in Taiwan from 2003 to \n2005. He has worked in the United States since 2005.3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Taiwanese citizen. They met when he was visiting Taiwan in \n2009. He sponsored her to immigrate to the United States. They married in the United \nStates. She is a permanent resident (green card holder), and she plans to apply to \nbecome a U.S. citizen. Their child was born in the United States.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is deceased. His wife\u2019s father and her three siblings are \ncitizens and residents of Taiwan. None of Applicant\u2019s in-laws work for the Taiwanese \ngovernment. His father-in-law owned a small business before he retired. Applicant does \nnot provide financial support to his in-laws. He talks to his father-in-law about once a \nweek when his wife talks to him. He talks to his wife\u2019s siblings less often.5 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 14-16; GE 1; AE A, B, D. \n \n2 Tr. at 15; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n3 Tr. at 29; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n4 Tr. at 17-19; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, M. \n \n5 Tr. at 19-26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE C, P. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant does not own any property or other assets in Taiwan. He owns a home \nand other assets in the United States. He estimated his net worth at $600,000. He \ncredibly testified that his in-laws in Taiwan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him \ninto revealing classified information, and that he would report any attempt to do so.6 \n \nApplicant is active in his community. He submitted documents and letters \nattesting to his strong moral character and outstanding job performance. He is praised \nfor his honesty, trustworthiness, dependability, dedication, reliability, work ethic, \nintegrity, and loyalty to the United States.7  \n \nTaiwan  \n \nThe United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. The 1979 \nU.S.-P.R.C. Joint Communique switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. \nIn the Joint Communique, the United States recognized the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese \nposition that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The Joint Communique \nalso stated that the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and \nother unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. The American Institute in Taiwan \n(AIT) is responsible for implementing U.S. policy toward Taiwan. \n \nThe United States does not support Taiwan independence. Maintaining strong, \nunofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal, in line with the U.S. desire to further \npeace and stability in Asia. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act provides the legal basis for \nthe unofficial relationship between the United States and Taiwan, and enshrines the \nU.S. commitment to assist Taiwan in maintaining its defensive capability. The United \nStates insists on the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences, opposes unilateral \nchanges to the status quo by either side, and encourages both sides to continue their \nconstructive dialogue on the basis of dignity and respect.  \n \nThe United States faces a serious threat to its national security from Chinese \nintelligence operations. China aggressively targets U.S. sensitive and protected \ninformation and Chinese actors are the world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic \nespionage. Taiwan has also been an active collector of U.S. economic technologies that \nhave sensitive military applications. Numerous cases have arisen involving the illegal \nexport or attempted export of sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 22-23, 27-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE H. \n \n7 AE A, C, G. \n\n \n4 \n \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s father and her three siblings are citizens and residents of \nTaiwan. Taiwan has been an active collector of U.S. economic technologies that have \nsensitive military applications. Numerous cases have arisen involving the illegal export \nor attempted export of sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly and \nthrough his wife. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. His parents and two siblings are U.S. siblings \nand residents. One sibling works for the U.S. military. His wife is a permanent resident \nof the United States with plans to apply to become a U.S. citizen. Their child was born in \nthe United States. All of Applicant\u2019s assets are in the United States. None of his in-laws \nwork for the Taiwanese government. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan are outweighed by his deep and long-\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. His closest family, life, home, \nassets, and professional career are in the United States. Taiwan collects U.S. \nintelligence, as does other U.S. allies, but it does not have a poor human rights record, \nand there is no indication that it uses coercion in its intelligence operations. I find that it \nis unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of the United States and the interests of Taiwan. There is no conflict of \n\n \n7 \n \ninterest, because he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nstrong character evidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns based upon Applicant\u2019s purchase and use of marijuana between May 2003 and March 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.) and his expressed intent to continue to use marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.c.). In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., and he denied SOR \u00b6 1.c. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 28 years old. In December 2014, he earned a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree in computer science. Since April 2015, he has been employed as a software engineer with a DOD contractor. He is not married, and he does not have any children.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse). The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 13, 2018, and he requested a \nhearing. On April 30, 2019, a notice of hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for \nMay 15, 2019. The hearing proceeded as scheduled. Applicant testified and submitted \nthree documents, which I admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C, without \nobjection. Department Counsel submitted two documents, which I admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, without objection. On May 29, 2019, Applicant \n\n2 \n \nsubmitted an email and two attachments, which I admitted as AE D through F, without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript on May 31, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns \nbased upon Applicant\u2019s purchase and use of marijuana between May 2003 and March \n2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.) and his expressed intent to continue to use marijuana (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c.). In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., and he \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.c. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. In December 2014, he earned a bachelor\u2019s and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in computer science. Since April 2015, he has been employed as a \nsoftware engineer with a DOD contractor. He is not married, and he does not have any \nchildren. (GE 1; Tr. 24) \n \n \nOn his April 2018 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant reported that he \nused marijuana \u201c[e]very couple of months on average socially\u201d between May 2003 and \nMarch 2018. He also admitted that he had purchased marijuana on multiple occasions \nbetween May 2005 and September 2017. Section 23 further queried, \u201cDo you intend to \nuse this drug or controlled substance in the future?,\u201d he answered \u201cYes.\u201d He also \nresponded, \u201cI will almost certainly purchase some [marijuana] at some future point in my \nlife.\u201d (GE 1; Tr. 28) \n \n \nDuring his July 2018 security interview, Applicant confirmed his illegal drug history \nas delineated in his SCA. From May 2003 to September 2009, he used marijuana about \ntwo to three times a year. From about September 2009 to September 2010, he used \nmarijuana approximately four times a year. From September 2010 to May 2011, he did \nnot use marijuana. From about 2012 to December 2014, he used marijuana about every \nweekend. From December 2014 to March 2018, he used marijuana about two to three \ntimes a year. He typically used marijuana with his former roommate or his brother. He \nsometimes purchased marijuana from friends or family members, and at times others \nshared marijuana with him. (GE 1; Tr. 24) \n \n \nDuring his security interview, Applicant acknowledged that his marijuana use likely \nviolated his employer\u2019s policies. He further stated that he would likely continue to use \nmarijuana even if inconsistent with his possession of a DOD security clearance. At the \ntime of his security interview, Applicant continued to possess marijuana he had purchased \nin September 2017, and he expressed his intent to use and purchase marijuana in the \nfuture. As of July 2018, he continued to associate with his former roommate, his brother, \nand others with whom he had previously used marijuana. (GE 2) \n \n \nBetween his July 2018 security interview and his December 2018 Answer, \nApplicant experienced a change in perspective about his future marijuana use and \npurchase. He testified that his mindset began to evolve after his security interview. In his \nAnswer, he explained that his previously viewpoint mirrored his understanding of \nnationwide trends towards the legalization of recreation marijuana, but he now \n\n3 \n \nunderstood the gravity of substance misuse in the context of his security clearance \neligibility. (Answer; AE A; Tr. 12, 51-52) \n \n \nAt hearing, Applicant confirmed his marijuana use from May 2003 to March 2018 \nand his marijuana purchase from May 2005 to September 2017. He testified that he no \nlonger associates with most of the individuals with whom he previously used marijuana.  \nApplicant continues to associate with his brother and his former roommate, both of whom \nused marijuana with Applicant in the past. In May 2019, he attended a social gathering at \nhis brother\u2019s house where individuals used marijuana outside the house while Applicant \nremained inside. Applicant had previously used marijuana at social gatherings at his \nbrother\u2019s house on multiple occasions in the past. (Tr. 25-26, 42) \n \n \nIn addition to reducing his contacts with individuals with whom he had used \nmarijuana, Applicant has experienced several other changes in his life in recent years. \nHe moved in mid-2018, so he no longer lives with the roommate with whom he had used \nmarijuana. His job responsibilities have dramatically expanded in the last year, and he \nhas been more focused on his career. During the past year, he has been studying for a \ntechnical certification to increase his career opportunities, and he has undertaken new \nhobbies and activities. In a post-hearing statement, Applicant explained that he had \n\u201cevolved substantially as a person\u201d in recent years. (Tr. 21-25, 41-43; AE D) \n \n  \n \nApplicant explained that when he completed his SCA, he wanted to honestly \nanswer the questions about his drug involvement; however, the questions did not cause \nhim to reconsider his future use and purchase of marijuana. Applicant testified that when \nhe completed his SCA and during his security interview, he sought to answer honestly \nabout the possibility he may use marijuana during the rest of his life, though he did not \nhave any immediate plans to do so. He further admitted he was aware that his marijuana \nwas illegal and in violation of his employer\u2019s policies at the time of his use. Applicant \nclarified the frequency of his marijuana use between 2012 and December 2014, testifying \nthat he used marijuana approximately 15 times during this span instead of every \nweekend, as reported in the security interview. He also explained that there had been \nperiods between May 2003 and March 2018 when he did not use marijuana for a year or \ntwo. He admitted that he did not realize until the DOHA hearing that even being around \nother individuals using marijuana was a security concern. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible and sincere. (Tr. 28-31, 45-46, 53-55) \n \n \nApplicant has received several awards and high praise during his annual \nperformance reviews for 2017 and 2018. His work performance, work ethic, and subject-\nmatter expertise are well regarded by his supervisors. His salary has dramatically \nincreased since he began his employment with the DOD contractor, and he was recently \npromoted. There is no evidence that any of Applicant\u2019s character references are aware \nof Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use and purchases. Applicant testified that he has not informed \nhis supervisors or his facility security officer because, in part, he was concerned about \nthe potential negative impact to his employment. (AE A-F; Tr. 33-37) \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n\n5 \n \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse; \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement \u2013 his illegal use and purchase of marijuana \u2013 \nspanned May 2003 through March 2018. On his April 2018 SCA and during his July 2018 \nsecurity interview, he twice expressed his intent to continue to use and purchase \nmarijuana, regardless of whether it was illegal, against his employer\u2019s policies, or \ninconsistent with possessing a DOD security clearance. The Government produced \nsubstantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g).  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand  \n \n(3) provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement spanned from May 2003 until at least March 2018. \nAs of July 2018, Applicant expressed an intent to continue to use and purchase marijuana, \ndespite knowing such conduct was illegal, violated his employer\u2019s policies, and was \n\n6 \n \ninconsistent with the expectations of those possessing a security clearance. At some time \nbetween his July 2018 security interview and his December 2018 Answer, Applicant \nrealized the gravity of his drug involvement and expressed intent to continue such conduct \nand the potential impact on his career. He has taken on greater responsibilities at work \nand endeavored to obtain a technical certification to advance his career. He moved in \nmid-2018, and he has disassociated from most of his drug-using friends. \n \n  \nThe dramatic changes in Applicant\u2019s perspective, lifestyle, and environment within \nthe last several months must be weighed against the 15-year span of his drug \ninvolvement. Furthermore, although he has disassociated from many of his drug-using \nfriends, Applicant attended a social gathering in May 2019 where a friend and Applicant\u2019s \nbrother used marijuana. I found Applicant\u2019s expressed intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement to be sincere and credible; however, it is simply too soon to conclude that \nhis behavior was so long ago or unlikely to recur and that he has established a pattern of \nabstinence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the AG \n\u00b6 2(d) factors in this whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work performance, work ethic, and subject-matter expertise are well-\nregarded by his supervisors and character references; however, none of these individuals \nis aware of his drug involvement. Applicant\u2019s knowingly and willfully violated state and \nfederal laws and his employer\u2019s policies with his use and purchase of marijuana, and he \nrepeatedly express his intent to continue such conduct. In the last several months, \nApplicant\u2019s perspective on his drug involvement has dramatically changed, and I found \nhis expressed intent to abstain from all illegal drugs sincere. Nonetheless, taken with his \ncontinued presence in environments where illegal drugs are present and given his lengthy \ndrug history, it is simple too early to conclude that he has established a pattern of \n\n7 \n \nabstinence. Applicant has not mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nEric H. Borgstrom \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Esq. \n \n11/01/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nraised by Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and failure to timely file federal and state income \ntax returns. He has mitigated the concerns raised by his untimely filing of federal and \nstate income tax returns, but he has not mitigated the concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 6, 2017. On March \n14, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 15, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 1, 2019, and the \ncase was assigned to me on July 23, 2019. On August 28, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nSeptember 26, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not offer \nthe testimony of any other witnesses. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through BB were \nattached to his response to the SOR and were reintroduced at the hearing. AX CC through \nFF were submitted at the hearing. AX A through FF were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 16, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old test engineer employed by a defense contractor. He \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 1989 to September 1993. He \nenlisted in the Army National Guard in June 1994. In March 1995, he reenlisted in the \nU.S. Navy. He served on active duty until he retired from the Navy in May 2012 as a chief \nwarrant officer. He held a security clearance in the Navy and retained it when he was \nemployed by a defense contractor.  \n \n \nApplicant married in June 1993, divorced in February 2013, and married his current \nspouse in May 2014. He has five children from his first marriage, ages 26, 24, 17, 14, and \n11. He has three stepchildren in his current marriage. He attended a technical institute \nfrom September 2013 to September 2014, enrolled in a university in January 2015, and \ncompleted the requirements for a bachelor\u2019s degree in technical management in August \n2019. (Tr. 21.) \n \nApplicant was unemployed for about a month after retiring from the Navy. He was \nemployed in the food-processing industry from August 2012 to July 2013. In May 2013, \nhe was reprimanded and suspended for two days after using derogatory language about \na subordinate during a conversation with his supervisor. In June 2013, he was placed on \nan \u201cemployee improvement program\u201d after cross-contamination of food occurred during \nan operation under his supervision. In July 2013, he quit his job because he was frustrated \nwith the work environment. (GX 1 at 17.) He was unemployed from July 2013 to April \n2014, when he was hired by his current employer.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Navy career was stellar until September 2010. He progressed rapidly \nthrough the ranks, received numerous awards and decorations, and was commissioned \nas a warrant officer in 2009. He deployed on sea duty in May 2010, and he had been at \nsea for about four months when his then wife told him that she wanted a divorce. He \nbecame deeply depressed and his duty performance deteriorated to the point that he \nreceived two \u201cletters of instruction\u201d from his commanding officer and was detached for \ncause from his assignment. Faced with a board of inquiry to determine whether he should \n\n \n3 \n \nbe separated from the Navy, he chose to retire. (AX A at 2.) He has a service-connected \ndisability due to sinusitis (10%) and a major depressive disorder (50%). (Tr. 20.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s then wife filed for divorce in 2011. The divorce was final in February \n2013, and Applicant was ordered to pay child support for their five children in the amounts \nof $1,350 per month from December 2012 to January 2014; $1,203 per month until \nDecember 2019; $960 per month until April 2023, and $617 per month until February \n2026. (AX I.) He also was required to pay his ex-wife alimony of $1,000 per month, and \nshe was awarded 37.9 % of his military retired pay.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $66,603, and failures to timely \nfile federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. The \ndelinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from August 2018 and May 2017 (GX 4 \nand 5.)  \n \nOn March 29, 2019, about two weeks after the SOR was issued, Applicant hired a \ndebt-management company and enrolled in a debt-management plan (DMP), under \nwhich he pays the debt-management company $195 per week to manage the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, which he expects to resolve by 2023. (AX L at 4, 10, \n15.) Applicant is directly responsible for other debts not in the DMP. The evidence \nconcerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit-card account charged off for $22,120. This debt is included \nin Applicant\u2019s DMP. A $78 payment was made on April 12, 2019. (AX X at 1.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: vehicle loan charged off for $9,697. This debt is included in \nApplicant\u2019s DMP. A $204 payment was made on April 19, 2019. (AX X at 1.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: cellphone account placed for collection of $3,871. This debt was \nsettled for $1,858 in April 2019. (AX M.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: unsecured personal loan charged off for $3,858. This debt is \nincluded in Applicant\u2019s DMP, which provides for a monthly payment of $443. (AX X at 2.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: collection account placed for collection of $1,919. This debt was \nadded to Applicant\u2019s DMP in May 2019, and it provides for monthly $300 payments. (AX \nY; Tr. 23-24.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: telecommunications account placed for collection of $460. In April \n2019, this debt was settled for $322. (AX O.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: utility bill placed for collection of $387. This debt was paid in \nOctober 2018. (AX P.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: telecommunications account placed for collection of $384. This \ndebt was settled for $268 in April 2019. (AX Q.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: cellphone account placed for collection of $2,937. This debt was \nsettled for $1,200 in March 2019. (AX R.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: cellphone account placed for collection of $1,122. This debt was \nsettled for $617 in May 2019. (AX S.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: child-support arrearage of $19,848. This debt is not reflected in the \ncredit reports submitted in evidence by Department Counsel (GX 4 and 5). However, \nApplicant disclosed delinquent alimony payments totaling $30,000 in his SCA, during a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) in February 2018, and in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories. (GX 1 at 51; GX 2 at 9-10; GX 3.) The arrearage is actually a combination \nof alimony and child support. Applicant stopped paying child support and alimony when \nhe was unemployed in 2013 and 2014. (GX 2 at 10.) Pursuant to a court order, child \nsupport and alimony are withheld from Applicant\u2019s pay at the rate of $1,203 per month for \nchild support; $240 per month for a child-support arrearage; and $1,000 per month for \nalimony. He is paid weekly, and $564 per week is withheld from his pay. (AX T; AX V.) \nBetween March 2013 and September 2019, he has paid a total of about $161,446 in child \nsupport and alimony. (AX CC.) \n \nIn May 2016, Appellant filed a motion to terminate the alimony on the ground that \nhis ex-wife and another man are living together as husband and wife and have two \nchildren together, but have not formally married because marriage would terminate her \nentitlement to alimony. The issue has not yet been resolved. (Tr. 17-18.) \n \nAppellant\u2019s ex-wife claims that he owes an arrearage of about $30,000 for alimony. \nHe testified that he has paid about $39,000 in alimony since he filed his motion to \nterminate it. If his alimony payments are refunded, the amount refunded would offset the \nchild-support arrearage. (Tr. 28.) Applicant\u2019s attorney for the alimony litigation is in the \nprocess of scheduling a trial date. (AX FF.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m: failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns \nfor 2015, 2016, and 2017. In Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated \nthat he did not file federal and state tax returns for 2015, 2016, and 2017, because he \nknew he was entitled to refunds, and he believed that his refunds would be seized and \napplied to the alimony arrearage. (GX 2 at 10; GX 3 at 3.) He testified that his accountant \nadvised him that he could file late if he was entitled to refunds, so long as he filed within \nthree years to avoid forfeiture of the refunds. (Tr. 29-30.) All past-due federal and state \ntax returns were filed in March and April 2018. (AX W; AX-Z; AX EE.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is about $14,970. He has monthly expenses of \nabout $7,943 and debt payments of about $5,602, leaving a net monthly remainder of \n$1,424. (AX J.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s site manager has known him for several years and has been his \nsupervisor for one year. He states that Applicant \u201cconsistently demonstrates high moral \n\n \n5 \n \ncharacter and solid personal conduct.\u201d He trusts Applicant \u201cimplicitly and without \nhesitation.\u201d (AX C at 1.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s project manager has known Applicant for five years and has been his \nsupervisor for three years. He states that Applicant \u201calways seeks to do what is right and \nhonest for the company as well as our U.S. Navy customer.\u201d He has no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, and reliability. (AX C at 2.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n \n6 \n \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n\n \n7 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s marital breakup, the legal expenses \nrelated to alimony, his premature retirement from the Navy, his major depressive disorder, \nand his short period of unemployment after retiring from the Navy were conditions largely \nbeyond his control. However, his unemployment from July 2013 to April 2014 was \nvoluntary and not a condition beyond his control. Furthermore, he has not acted \nresponsibly. Even though he has been employed since April 2014, he took no significant \naction to resolve the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR until October 2018, when he \npaid the delinquent utility bill. He did not hire the debt-management company or pay any \nof the other debts alleged in the SOR until he received the SOR and realized that his \nsecurity clearance was in jeopardy. An applicant who waits until his clearance is in \njeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant has received financial counseling and \nenrolled in a DMP, but he has not yet established a track record of payments on the three \ndebts included in the DMP. He has not yet resolved the alimony issue. He is making \nregular child-support payments by court-mandated automatic payroll deductions, but he \nhas not yet resolved the child-support arrearage. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f-1.j, which are \nresolved. It is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, which are \nincluded in the DMP, because Applicant has not yet established a track record of \ncompliance with the payment agreements. It is not established for the child-support \narrearage, which is being paid by involuntary payroll deductions, which are not the \nequivalent of good-faith payments. See ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, \n2011). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. Applicant has no federal or state tax debts, and he has \nfiled all the overdue tax returns. I have noted that Applicant candidly admitted that he \ndelayed filing his income tax returns to prevent his ex-wife from seizing his refunds. \nHowever, I have also noted that he relied on bad advice from an accountant about his \nobligation to file timely returns and that he filed the past-due returns a year before the \nSOR was issued. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, sincere, and \ncredible at the hearing. He served with distinction in the Navy for many years and held a \nsecurity clearance without incident. His military career ended abruptly when his wife of \nmany years left him and he fell into a period of deep depression. Since his retirement \nfrom the Navy, he has earned the respect of his current supervisors. He has recently \ntaken significant steps to right his financial ship. However, he did not seriously address \nhis delinquent debts until he realized that his security clearance was in jeopardy. \nFurthermore, insufficient time has passed to determine whether he will comply with his \npayment agreements and resolve the alimony and child-support issues. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.37 through E3.1.40 (reconsideration authorized after one year). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence \n\n \n9 \n \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his failures to timely file his federal and state income tax returns, but \nhe has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.f-1.j, 1.l, and 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.k: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 63-year-old software engineer currently employed by a federal contractor since October 2012. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1988, his master\u2019s degree in 1991, and attended law school from 2000 until 2002. He worked as a government contractor from 1988 until 2010, when he was laid off. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a security clearance. He and his wife married in 1980 and have three adult children. (GX 1.) The SOR alleges a 2014 mortgage-loan foreclosure and six debts totaling $29,205.

Pristera, Esq. \n \n09/09/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nDue to circumstances largely beyond his control, Applicant incurred delinquent \ndebts. However, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances and has mitigated \nthe potential financial security concern. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on June 27, 2017. On \nNovember 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \nDOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 25, 2019, and the case \nwas assigned to me on April 8, 2019. On June 7, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings \n\n2 \n \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for June 26, 2019. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) \nA and B were admitted without objection. I left the record open until July 10, 2019, to \nenable Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX C through AX \nF, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 8, \n2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old software engineer currently employed by a federal \ncontractor since October 2012. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1988, his master\u2019s \ndegree in 1991, and attended law school from 2000 until 2002. He worked as a \ngovernment contractor from 1988 until 2010, when he was laid off. This is Applicant\u2019s first \napplication for a security clearance. He and his wife married in 1980 and have three adult \nchildren. (GX 1.)  \n \nThe SOR alleges a 2014 mortgage-loan foreclosure and six debts totaling $29,205. \nThe debts are comprised of: two delinquent student loans totaling $26,313; a $616 \nmedical debt; a $396 medical debt; a $500 cellular phone service debt; and a $1,380 \nequipment-lease debt. Applicant admits the foreclosure, the two delinquent student loans, \nand the medical debt. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e.) He denies the other three debts. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g.) The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s February \n2019, August 2018, in July 2017 credit bureau reports (CBR) (GX 6; GX 5; GX 4), and \ndiscussed in his personal subject interview (PSI) summary (GX 2). Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nIn 2007, Applicant cosigned a mortgage loan for his son. He loaned his son \n$20,000 for the down payment, and spent time and money on renovations. Unbeknownst \nto Applicant, his son defaulted on the mortgage loan and the loan was foreclosed in \nOctober 2011. Applicant\u2019s son did not disclose the foreclosure, and Applicant did not \nreceive independent notice of it. He learned of the foreclosure when another family \nmember told him that his son was moving. Applicant then questioned his son about the \nstatus of the foreclosure, who told Applicant the process was complete. (Tr. 72-75.) The \ndebt does not appear on Applicant\u2019s February and June 2019 CBRs. (GX 6; AX E.) \n \nApplicant incurred student loans to attend law school. He did not graduate, and at \nsome point the loans became due. Applicant was contacted by two different creditors, \nwas uncertain of how to repay the loans, and suspicious about why he was being \ncontacted by companies with different names. He attempted to contact the creditors in an \neffort to consolidate the loans but was unsuccessful. (GX 2; Tr. 51.) Applicant remained \naware of the outstanding student loans, and intended to pay them, but he did not take \nfurther action, and the creditors stopped contacting him. During his testimony, Applicant \nstated that he recognizes that these debts are his responsibility and that he did not intend \nto shirk this obligation, but, while by no means an excuse, he did not focus on making the \n\n3 \n \nrepayment of these accounts a priority once the creditors stopped contacting him. (Tr. 57-\n59.)  \n \nAfter being laid off from his federal contracting job in 2010, he opened a cellular \ntelephone store. He entered a lease agreement for a specific period of years with a \ncompany for a credit-card processing machine. Applicant\u2019s business venture was \nunsuccessful, and in 2012 he contacted the company he leased the credit-card \nprocessing machine from and informed the company that he was going out of business. \nThe company representative told Applicant to send the machine back with a letter of \nexplanation, and that despite not fulfilling the terms of the lease agreement, the company \nwould terminate the lease and Applicant would have no further financial obligations. \nApproximately 18 months later, a representative from the company called Applicant and \nstated that he owed the company $1,380 for the machine. (SOR \u00b6 1.g.) Applicant \nexplained his previous agreement with the company and disputed owing anything. He \nwas not contacted again by the company. The creditor of this debt filed for and secured \na judgment against Applicant which was entered in January 2019. However, Applicant \ndid not receive notice of this process. (Tr. 25-26; GX 3; Tr. 63.) Applicant\u2019s June 2019 \nCBR shows that he has disputed this debt. (AX E.) Despite denying liability for this debt, \nApplicant is willing to pay it to reach resolution of the account. (Tr. 70.) \n \nAt the time of his PSI in 2017, Applicant was aware only of his delinquent student-\nloan accounts. After being shown his CBR by the investigator and discussing the \ndelinquent accounts listed on it, Applicant became concerned about the $1,380 listed debt \nfor the credit-card machine and other debts that he did not recognize. Applicant was \nspecifically concerned that some of the debts might have been incurred by his son \nbecause they share the same name. (Tr. 25-29.) \n \nAdditionally, Applicant contacted the three major credit reporting agencies and \nattempted to contact the various creditors listed on his CBR in an effort to either validate \nor dispute the listed debts. His efforts did not produce sufficient information to resolve his \naccounts. Specifically, Applicant could only find a post-office box contact for his student \nloans creditor. In March 2019, Applicant entered an agreement with the credit-repair \ncompany for the company to perform an audit of Applicant\u2019s CBR and to verify or dispute \non his behalf the creditors\u2019 entries. (AX A; AX B.)  \n \nThrough the credit-repair company, Applicant has successfully disputed the $616 \nmedical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and the $500 cellular telephone service debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f), both \nof which he denied owing. Applicant admitted the $396 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e as his account, but stated that he had paid it. This debt has been removed from \nApplicant\u2019s CBR. The foreclosure has also been removed from Applicant\u2019s CBR. (AX E.) \nApplicant is committed to repaying his student-loan debts and is awaiting the outcome of \nthe credit-repair company\u2019s audit for his next step. (Tr. 53-55.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s CBRs show a credit history that dates back to 2002, that includes paid- \noff lines of credit and credit cards. Applicant\u2019s mortgage loan for his home is paid in full. \nHe has a home equity loan of approximately $50,000 and makes timely payments. (GX \n\n4 \n \n4; GX 2.) Applicant invests in a 401(k) with a current balance of approximately $200,000. \nHis wife is retired and receives a monthly pension payment. He lives within his means \nand is fiscally stable and responsible. (Tr. 50-51.) Applicant is a valued employee, and he \nreceived a 3% raise in June 2019. (AX C.) Applicant was straightforward, sincere, and \ncredible in his testimony.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n5 \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information\u2026. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline:  AG \u00b6 19(a): an inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe conditions that caused Applicant\u2019s past financial issues arose under \ncircumstances which were largely beyond his control. Specifically, Applicant was unaware \nof the house foreclosure (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and did not receive notice of it until after the \nforeclosure was complete. Additionally, he was unaware of the medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nand cellular phone account debt (SOR 1\u00b6 1.f). After learning of the delinquent accounts, \nApplicant acted responsibly by first contacting the major credit reporting agencies to \nvalidate or dispute the accounts. Dissatisfied with this effort, he then engaged the services \nof a credit-repair company, which successfully disputed the medical debt, the cellular \nservice debt, and the foreclosure. Applicant had previously paid the medical debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e, and it has been removed from his CBR. He denies liability for the credit- \ncard machine debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and disputed it. However, he is willing to pay this debt to \nresolve it. The credit-repair company will advise Applicant on how to repay his student \nloans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c), and Applicant has the means to do so.  \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A trustworthiness adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \nApplicant has an overall long-standing sound financial record, which includes \nrepayment of his mortgage loan and credit cards. He lives within his means and does not \nhave any recent delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s previously incurred delinquent accounts \ndo not cast doubt on his current judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Although \nApplicant\u2019s financial record is not perfect, he has made a good-faith effort to repay his \ndebts and has established a plan to resolve his remaining financial issues within his \nmeans. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (b) through 20(e) apply. \n \n\n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances.  I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the potential security concerns raised by his financial issues. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR soon thereafter, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on March 14, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March \n18, 2019, scheduling the hearing for April 23, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 7, which were admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf. Applicant presented seven \ndocuments, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through G, and admitted into \nevidence. The record was left open until May 23, 2019, for receipt of additional \n\n \n2 \n \ndocumentation. On April 29, 2019, Applicant submitted her closing statement, but no \nfurther exhibits.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 6 \nand 12.) She is divorced from an abusive husband, and has three children, two of which \nlive with Applicant and for whom she receives only \u201c$70.00 a week\u201d in child support. (TR \nat page 18 line 19 to page 23 line 20.) Applicant attributes her financial difficulties to \nleaving her abusive husband, coupled with periods of unemployment. (Id.)

Applicant admits that she owes about $11,659 on a past-due credit card \naccount. Since October of 2018, Applicant has been making monthly payments of $250, \nas evidenced by a payment agreement with the creditor. (TR at page 24 lines 1~23, and \nAppX D.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. and 1.c. As a result of her divorce, Applicant and her former spouse had an \nautomobile and a motor cycle repossessed.

(AppX F.) I find Applicant is making a good-faith effort to repay these debts. \n \n \n1.d.  Applicant admits that she owes about $1,256 on a past-due cell phone \naccount. Since September of 2018, Applicant has been making monthly payments of \n$125, as evidenced by receipts from the creditor. (TR at page 27 line 11 to page 28 line \n3, and AppX E.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.e. and 1.f. Applicant denies that she owes State E about $6,494. (see GX 5 at \npages 5~6.) Her inquiries to State E have come up empty, and no such debt appears on \nApplicant\u2019s November 2018, March 2019, and April 2019 credit reports (CRs). (TR at \npage 28 line 4 to page 29 line 12, at page 36 lines 6~9, GXs 6 and 7, and AppX A.) \nThese allegations are found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admits that she owed the Department of Defense (DoD) about \n$497 as the result of an overpayment by DoD. (TR at page 29 line 15 to page 30 line 2.) \nThis alleged past-due debt was paid in September of 2018, as evidenced by a \n\u201cPayment Confirmation\u201d by DoD. (AppX C.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.h. and 1.i. Applicant denies that she owes the Department of Veterans Affairs \nabout $5,303. This debt was \u201cpaid\u201d through the Department of Treasury, as reflected on \nApplicant\u2019s April 2019 CR. (TR at page 30 line 2 to page 32 line 11, and AppX A at \npages 13 and 15, See also AppX B.) These allegations are found for Applicant. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \n\n \n4 \n \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant had significant, admitted past-due indebtedness. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n5 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant attributed her recent delinquencies to a divorce from an abusive \nspouse and to a period of unemployment. These are circumstances beyond her control. \nApplicant established that she has acted reasonably or responsibly with respect to her \ndebts. Applicant has demonstrated that she addressed her admitted debts in a \nresponsible or timely manner. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.i.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

White, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n07/09/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the record in this case,1 I deny Applicant=s clearance. \nOn 11 January 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, \nand Guideline H, Drug Involvement.2 Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a \ndecision without hearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \nrecord in this case closed 1 May 2019, when Applicant=s Response to the FORM was \ndue. DOHA assigned the case to me 3 June 2019. \n1Consisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-4. \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective 8 \nJune 2017.  \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted failing to timely file his state and Federal income tax returns, as \nalleged, and using illegal drugs between 1985 and October 2017, as alleged. He is a 49-\nyear-old maintenance technician employed by a U.S. defense contractor since \nSeptember 2014. He has never been married and has no children. He has no prior \nFederal or military service. He has not previously held an industrial clearance (Item 3). \n       \n \n \nApplicant disclosed his failure to file his 2009 Federal income tax return on his \nNovember 2017 clearance application (Item 3). He also disclosed the drug use alleged in \nthe SOR. Applicant=s sworn, but undated, Response to DOHA interrogatories (Item \n4).disclosed that Applicant untimely filed his 2010, 2012, 2013 Federal income tax \nreturns, and had not filed his 2015 Federal income tax returns as of the time of the \ninterrogatories. He also had not filed his 2014 and 2015 state income tax returns. He \nprovided some evidence of working with a commercial tax preparation firm, and some \nevidence of payment plans with the state and Federal governments, but did not provide \na comprehensive view of his tax situation. He did not further illuminate his drug use. \n \nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a \nbudget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community \ninvolvement. He submitted no current credit reports which might have corroborated his \nclaimed payments. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nH (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,  \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3 \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his state \nand Federal income tax returns for different years between 2010 and 2015. He has stated \nno credible reason for his failure, and his documented contacts with the tax preparation \nfirm and the state and Federal tax authorities do not present a comprehensive view of his \ncurrent tax status.4  \n \nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may  \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. \n \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access to \nclassified information. Indeed, the Board has previously noted \nthat a person who has a history of not fulfilling their legal \nobligation to file income tax returns may be said not to have \ndemonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability \nrequired for access to classified information.@5 \n \nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful6 or attributed to the press of other \ncircumstances.7 As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of \nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal \nor state income tax returns for 10 years.  \n \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal \nobligation. Applicant=s . . . failure to have done so for many \nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling \n                                                 \n3See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n4&19(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \n5ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge=s favorable \ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years). \n6See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester). \n7See, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file). \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that \ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A person \nwho fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff=d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the Judge noted, \nDirective, Enclosure 2 & 19(g) explicitly provides that failure \nto file tax returns is a circumstance that can raise a security \nconcern. Moreover, the Directive presumes a nexus between \nadmitted or proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and \nan applicant=s eligibility for a clearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-04648 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. \n14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015). \n \nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an Applicant \nis financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case his failure \nto timely file his Federal returns for at least eight years has created significant tax debt \nthat he has not addressed. \n \n  \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His \nfailures to timely file his Federal returns are multiple, recent, and the circumstances are \nnot demonstrated to be unlikely to recur.8 Moreover, he has not demonstrated that his \nfailures to timely file and his subsequent failures to timely pay or make pay arrangements \nwere due to circumstances beyond his control, and it is clear that he has not been \nresponsible in addressing his taxes.9 \n  \nApplicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, although five of the debts \nwere settled, however untimely.10 The absence of payment on one account, late payment \non four other accounts, and the absence of dates on the six settled accounts means \nApplicant cannot demonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. \nThe missing details of his tax resolution program requires the same conclusion regarding \n                                                 \n8&20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . .  \n9&20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n10&20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nhis taxes.11 Moreover, he submitted no work or character evidence which might support \na whole-person assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his conduct. I \nconclude Guideline F against Applicant. \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by \ndemonstrating Applicant=s illegal drug abuse between 1985 and October 2017. He used \nhallucinogens and cocaine (albeit allegedly only until July 2012). Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns. 12 While Applicant self-reported his drug use on his \nclearance application, he never provided a comprehensive explanation of the \ncircumstances of his drug use, and cessation of that drug use.13 \n \nDrug involvement mitigating conditions give little support to Applicant. His illegal \ndrug abuse was recent, the frequency unclear, and the circumstances unexplained.14 \nThe record contains no evidence of what steps Applicant has taken to dissociate himself \nfrom illegal drug use. Finally, he has not disavowed future use, either within the old \nguidelines or the new guidelines.15 Under the circumstances, I cannot conclude Applicant \nis unlikely to abuse illegal drugs in the future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against \nApplicant. \n \n Formal Findings \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs a-b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2. Guideline H:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs a-b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n                                                 \n11&20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n12&25(a) any substance misuse; (c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, \n13If, indeed, he fully ceased using hallucinogens. His clearance application brings his use up to the month \nbefore his clearance application, and there is no clear statement that the use ceased. \n14&26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment [Emphasis supplied]; \n15&26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence \nof actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; and (3) a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility; \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nClearance denied. \n \n  \n  \n \n \n_________________________ \nJOHN GRATTAN METZ, JR \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on January 17, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on \nJanuary 25, 2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM and identified as \n\n2 \n \nItems 1 through 6, is admitted without objection. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 4, 2019. Based on my review of the documentary \nevidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated the financial concerns. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee for a federal contractor, but currently on \nmedical disability leave. She is separated from her husband who she married in 2001, \nand she has one adult child. (Item 2) There is no information in the record concerning her \neducation. She has held a security clearance at least since 2015. She has been employed \nwith her current employer since January 2017. (Item 3) \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a-1.r, 18 delinquent accounts including student loans totaling \n$80,000, medical collection or charged-off accounts, and consumer accounts for a grand \ntotal of approximately $92,510. (Item 1) Applicant admitted debts listed on the SOR with \nthe exception of SOR 1.c-1.i, 1.k, 1.m 1.m, and 1.n and provided explanations. She also \ndenied one account (1.o) that had been paid, and enclosed a receipt as proof of payment.  \n(Items 1, 2) Her credit reports confirm the remaining delinquent debts. (Items 5, 6) \n \n \nApplicant attributes her delinquent debts to her separation and the process of a \ndivorce. She noted that she has bad credit as a result of her husband not paying bills that \nhe promised to pay. She referred to a 2015 DOHA decision that granted her a clearance \nand showed that she was unemployed  due to illness and medical bills. (Item 2) Applicant \nat that time had debt of about $22,000. She also claimed identity theft. In her answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant explained that she has paid medical expenses which were $8,078 in \n2015 and are now $1,837. She further explained that she is on medical disability. (Item \n2) In her answer to the SOR, she denied all other accounts either because she needed \nto investigate them or she had disputed them. She intended to pay all debts.  \n \n \nDuring the 2018 investigative interview, Applicant stated that she believed her \nstudent loans were in deferment. As to the other alleged debts, she stated that she did \nnot know the origin of the accounts, but she would investigate them. She stated that she \nwould obtain her credit report. (Item 2)  The majority of these debts were not included in \nthe 2015 DOHA decision. \n \n \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, nor did she present any documentary \nevidence of a plan to resolve debts. As to debts that were disputed, she presented no \ndocumentation or further explanation of her efforts. A December 2018 memorandum to a \ncredit bureau was submitted but did not refer to a specific account in dispute. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n4 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, and failure to pay her \ndelinquent debts or set up any payment plans raise two disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \n\n5 \n \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of  the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the debt. \n \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of \nfinancial difficulties for which she did not provide any documentation of efforts to resolve \nher debts. \n \n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. She \nhas not clearly documented any efforts to resolve debts (with the exception of 1.o). \nApplicant did not document that she acted responsibly after some events that were \nbeyond her control happened. She stated she would investigate her credit reports after \nthe subject interview but she did not document any efforts that she may have made to \nresolve them. Applicant has no financial or credit counseling, and there is no evidence \nany of the disputed debts were resolved in her favor. Her lack of effort does not \ndemonstrate a track record. Furthermore, Applicant presented no \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns raised by her inaction on the debts. \nAccordingly, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n6 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant is separated and  was unemployed for medical reasons. Circumstances \nbeyond her control adversely affected her finances, but she has not acted reasonably and \nresponsibly to address her delinquent debts. She took  no action to address her student \nloans and other accounts. \n    \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.p-1.r: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, \neffective June 8, 2017. The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information \navailable to the Government, DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance. It recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative \njudge for a determination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, \nor revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nOn December 19, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting \nsubparagraph, 1.a, admitting, in part, subparagraphs 1.b and 2.a, and denying \nsubparagraph 1.c. He requested a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on \nMay 7, 2019. On June 27, 2019, DOHA scheduled the hearing for August 14, 2019. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, I considered Applicant\u2019s testimony and \nincorporated into the record five Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 5), and 22 Applicant \nExhibits (AE A \u2013 AE V). Also, I incorporated into the record two memos from \nDepartment Counsel, identifying them as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I (Administrative Notice \nRequest \u2013 Sudan), and HE II (Administrative Notice Request \u2013 Saudi Arabia). HE I and \nHE II contained multiple attachments detailing information about each respective \ncountry. I identified them as HE I, Attachment (Att.) 1 through Att. 5, and HE II, Att. 1 \nthrough Att. 4. I took administrative notice of the facts encapsulated in these \nattachments.  \n \nAt the close of the hearing, I left the record open until September 6, 2019 to allow \nthe parties to submit additional exhibits. On August 14, 2019, Department Counsel \nsubmitted updated information about Sudan (HE III, Att. 1 \u2013 Att. 13). I took \nadministrative notice of the requested information. The transcript was received on \nAugust 21, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old married man with four children. He was born and \nraised in Sudan, immigrating to the United States on a student visa in 1983 to attend \ncollege on an athletic scholarship. (Tr. 28) He graduated in 1989. (Tr. 56) As a religious \nand ethnic minority in Sudan, Applicant was the \u201ctarget of hate, harassment, and \npersecution from the Islamic government of Sudan.\u201d (AE B at 1). Consequently, he \napplied for, and was granted asylum in the United States in 1988, and became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 1997. (GE 2 at 4) \n \n \nAt or about the time Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen, he was working \nin retail. Motivated by a desire to help the country after 9/11, Applicant took a job as a \ntranslator in 2003. (AE B at 2) He performed the same work for several years, as the \ncontract changed hands multiple times.  \n \nApplicant has been working with his current employer overseas since 2018. (AE I \nat 2) According to the base commander, Applicant is \u201ca trusted linguist and loyal asset \nto the team.\u201d (AE L at 1) His work increased operational efficiency by saving 150,000 \nwork hours, and it improved the political and military dynamic between U.S. forces and \nthe foreign country\u2019s government officials. (AE L at 1) In the course of his duties, he has \npersonally sacrificed, and \u201cput himself in harm\u2019s way in support of U.S. forces,\u201d \nsometimes coming under hostile fire. (AE L at 1; Tr. 31)  According to his supervisor, \nthe lead linguist, Applicant is a highly valued member of her team, with great flexibility, \nwhich he has demonstrated by conducting staff trainings in topics as diverse as basic \ncombat life saver skills and shooting range skills. (AE O) According to his previous \nsupervisor, who oversaw his performance when he first began the job in January 2018, \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant contributes, \u201cnot only with his language skills, but most of all with his positive \napproach, his reliability, and his loyalty.\u201d (AE A at 2) \n \n \nA commander with whom Applicant worked in 2004 and later in 2008, \ncharacterized him as \u201cthe best cultural advisor and linguist that ever worked for [him] in \n[his] 30-year . . . career.\u201d (AE A at 3) Appellant\u2019s \u201castounding\u201d performance compelled \nthe commander to select him numerous times for service as a cultural advisor and \nlinguist for high-level protective service details for distinguished military advisors and \nvisiting U.S. dignitaries. (AE A at 3) In October 2009, Applicant received a certificate of \nappreciation. \n \n \nAccording to a former military member with whom Applicant served in 2007 at \nanother location, Applicant was the most trusted of the three interpreters assigned to his \nteam. (AE A) He would travel into a combat zone with the team \u201cfor several days at a \ntime, cultivat[ing] and meet[ing] confidential informants, and generat[ing] written \nproducts used for either force protection decisions or to build target packages used to \ncounter/mitigate insurgents.\u201d (AE A at 1) Impressed with Applicant\u2019s competence, \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor began to rely on his \u201cexperience, maturity, and wisdom,\u201d to help \nhim assess the reliability of confidential informants. (AE A at 1) In 2009, Applicant \nreceived a certificate of appreciation for his \u201cgreat service for [the] country.\u201d (AE D at 3) \n \n \nIn February 2012, after returning from leave, Applicant discovered that a new \ncommander had been assigned to the base where he worked. Their first interaction \noccurred when the commander asked him to drive him to the officer\u2019s club. While en \nroute, the commander asked him to relocate from an off-base flat to a residence on \nbase. (Supplementary Answer at 4) Applicant refused, explaining that it would be \ndifficult to move on short notice. Within 24 hours, Applicant\u2019s employer fired him. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer never provided a rationale for his dismissal. He did not \nlearn of his ex-employer\u2019s stated reasons for his dismissal until he applied for a security \nclearance. (Tr. 46) He was alleged to have corresponded with sources without \nauthorization, refused, on occasion, to provide translation services, violated the off-base \nliving agreement by not securing his own transportation, failed to pay a live-in cook for \nservices rendered, and he was alleged to have taken time off without authorization. (GE \n4) \n \n \nApplicant denies these allegations. He never met with any foreign national \nwithout receiving prior authorization. (Tr. 41) He was unaware of any issues regarding \nthe quality of his translation services. (Tr. 42) Consistent with his employment \nagreement for living off-base, Applicant requested a car. (GE 5 at 5) Although he never \nreceived one, it did not pose a problem because his clients usually picked him up \u201csince \n[their] work was off-base anyway.\u201d (Supplementary Answer at 4) As for the allegation \ninvolving the live-in cook, Applicant lived in his off-base flat with two other contractors. \nOne of these men hired the cook, and she lived with them in the apartment, together \nwith her husband. Applicant and his roommates agreed to pay the housekeeper $100 \nper month for her to cook for them. (Supplementary Answer at 4) Applicant did not care \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \nfor the type of food that she cooked, and stopped eating it and he stopped paying the \ncook. When he was terminated, he was unaware that the cook had filed a complaint \nwith his employer. (Tr. 46)  \n \n \nThe part of SOR subparagraph 2.a alleging use of unauthorized leave does not \nspecify the dates that Applicant allegedly took the unauthorized leave. The only time \nthat Applicant recalls when his use of leave could potentially have been a problem was  \nin February 2012 when he stayed on leave for a day longer than he originally requested. \n(AE G at 1 and 2) He e-mailed his employer while on leave, requesting the additional \nday, and they approved his request. (AE G at 1)  In retrospect, Applicant suspects that \nhe was terminated from his job because the commander who was assigned to the base \nwhile he was on leave preferred the  translator who was assigned to Applicant\u2019s position \ntemporarily while Applicant was on leave because the temporary translator spoke \nFrench as well as Arabic. (Supplementary Answer at 5)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Sudan. She is elderly and \ndoes not work. Before Applicant applied for a security clearance, he spoke with her \napproximately once per month. (GE 2 at 5) Now, he does not talk with her. (Tr. 16) His \nwife speaks with her approximately once every four months.  On one occasion in 2016, \nthey gave her $200. (GE 2 at 11)  \n \nApplicant has three sisters (S1, S2, and S3). S1 relocated from Sudan to the \nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) in 1990, becoming a naturalized citizen there that year. (Tr. 57) \nShe returned to Sudan in 2005 after a peace agreement was reached under which \nSudanese expatriates were welcomed back to help develop the country.

(HE III, Att. 1) \nThere is a national state of emergency in effect across Sudan, which gives security \nforces greater arrest and incarceration powers. (HE III, Att. 4) The Sudanese \ngovernment does not recognize dual citizenship and is likely to consider U.S.-Sudanese \ndual citizens as Sudanese citizens only. (Id.) In 1993, the United States designated \nSudan as a state sponsor of terrorism. (HE I, Att. 2 at 3) Terrorist groups are active in \nSudan and have stated their intent to harm Westerners and Western interests through \nsuicide operations, bombings, shootings, and kidnappings. (HE I, Att. 3 at 1)  \n \nSaudi Arabia \n \n \nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a monarchy. The U.S. has designated parts of \nSaudi Arabia as high terrorism threat locations. (HE I, Att. 3 at 2) Saudi Arabia has a \npoor human rights record. (HE II, Att. 4 at 1) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Applicant\u2019s sister, who lived for a few years in Saudi \nArabia, returned in 2018 to the U.K., the country where she is a naturalized citizen. \nConsequently, there are no Guideline B security concerns related to Saudi Arabia. \n \n  \nSudan is experiencing drastic change, as the military ousted its long-time dictator \napproximately six months ago. Instability runs high, and it is extremely unsafe for \nforeign travelers. Terrorism remains a significant problem. One of Applicant\u2019s sisters, \nwho lived in Sudan for four years, returned to the U.K. in 2017 where she has been a \ncitizen since 1990. Although Sudan is a dangerous country with a history of state \nsponsorship of terrorism, there is no record evidence that it has the infrastructure or the \nability to intimidate, threaten, or otherwise coerce its expatriates living abroad. \nApplicant\u2019s sister who lives in the U.K does not generate a security concern. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s other sister who returned to Sudan from the U.K in 2005 held a \nprominent job in the government. However, she lost that job in 2017, and Applicant lost \ntouch with her. He has not known her whereabouts since then. Because the potentially \napplicable disqualifying conditions under Guideline B (AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b)) are \npredicated on contacts or connections with foreign people, neither are applicable for this \nsister.  \n \n  \nAlthough Applicant is not close to his mother-in-law, he is vulnerable to coercion \nthrough his wife. This risk of coercion is heightened because of the dangerous, chaotic \nnature of Sudan and its history of sponsoring terrorism, and abusing human rights. AG \u00b6 \n7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies.  \n \n  \nApplicant has lived in the United States for more than 35 years, attending \ncollege, raising his family, immersing himself in the community, actively attending \nchurch and participating in volunteer activities. He has worked as a translator for much \nof the past 20 years, supporting the U.S. interest in various places, including combat \nzones where he has come under hostile fire in support of U.S. troops. Under these \ncircumstances, I am confident that \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because [his] \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or [he] has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States, that [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict in the \nU.S. interest.\u201d (AG \u00b6 8(b)) In sum, Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcerns. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) The alleged circumstances of Applicant\u2019s dismissal \nfrom his job in 2012 raise the issue of whether AG \u00b616(d), \u201ccredible adverse information \nthat is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself \nfor an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information,\u201d applies. \n \n \nApplicant admits that he was terminated from his job in 2012, but denies the \nreasons for the termination alleged in the SOR. His was not notified of the reasons for \nhis dismissal when it occurred, and was unaware of his ex-employer\u2019s basis for firing \nhim until he applied for a security clearance in 2017. Perhaps Applicant was engaging in \nsome of the conduct that led to his removal, as alleged. Specifically, it appears from the \nrecord that mingling with sources in the field, one of the stated reasons for firing \nApplicant, was not only tolerated by his previous command, but encouraged as a \nstrategy to build rapport in the community. Perhaps Applicant\u2019s employer manufactured \nthese allegations as a pretense for the new base commander to replace him with a \ntranslator whom he preferred, as Applicant suggests. Whatever may be the case, there \nis insufficient evidence in light of Applicant\u2019s denial to draw any negative security \ninferences related to his 2012 employment dismissal. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(d) \napplies, but is mitigated by AG \u00b6 17(f), \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated . . . .\u201d \nApplicant has mitigated the personal conduct security concern.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nI weighed the character that Applicant displayed in working for the U.S. as a \ntranslator. Moreover, in assessing his personal conduct, I concluded that the allegations \nleading to his discharge from a job in 2012 were not insignificant, but were an anomaly \ngiven the entirety of the record documenting the overwhelmingly positive assessments \nof Applicant\u2019s character and his job performance throughout his whole career. I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s sister is a citizen and resident of Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a Russian resident citizen who retired from a department of the Russian government (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that Applicant has a close friend of 50 years who is a resident citizen of Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted the Russian citizenship and residency of his sister, brother-in-law, and longtime friend. He indicated that his sister works as a lawyer in Russia, but not for the Russian government, and that he has only casual and infrequent communication with her. Applicant explained that his brother-in-law is a retired widower, who previously worked for a private stock company that provides electricity to a local community. He stated that his brother-in-law never worked for the Russian government and that he has had no contact with him in the last five to ten years. Applicant admitted that he maintained a friendship with his old schoolmate, but they communicate only a few times a year. Applicant denied that these Russian resident citizens could be a source of coercion or influence for him, citing his \u201cextensive\u201d loyalty and ties to the United States since 1991.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/09/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s ties to his native Russia because of his sister\u2019s, widowed brother-in-\nlaw\u2019s, and longtime friend\u2019s Russian citizenship and residency are mitigated by his \ncommitment to the United States, which includes his work as a translator for another \ndepartment of the U.S. government. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\nApplicant responded to the SOR through counsel on January 11, 2019. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). On March 15, 2019, counsel withdrew his representation. On April \n10, 2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On April15, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for May 9, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-2 and 4) were admitted. The \nGovernment submitted as proposed GE 3 a summary of personal subject interviews. The \ndocument was excluded on Applicant\u2019s objection for lack of the authentication required \nunder \u00b6 E.3.1.20 of the Directive. A March 11, 2019 letter forwarding the proposed GEs \nto Applicant\u2019s then legal representative, and a list of the GEs, were marked as hearing \nexhibits (HEs I-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Seventeen Applicant \nexhibits (AEs A-Q) were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 4, 2019. \n \n \n \n2 \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government submitted for administrative notice as GE 4 several \nfacts pertinent to Russia, as set forth in a Request for Administrative Notice\u2013The Russian \nFederation, dated March 11, 2019. The Government\u2019s request was based on excerpts of \nU.S. government publications, including a report of the National Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Center, Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace 2018 and a State \nDepartment report, Russia 2018 Crime & Safety Report: Moscow, dated February 12, \n2018. The Administrative Notice request was also based on a March 6, 2018 statement \nfor the record by the Director of National Intelligence, and on several press releases from \nthe U.S. Department of Justice concerning economic espionage activity against U.S. \ncommercial entities in favor of Russian interests. \n \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political \nconditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties of my intention to take administrative notice, subject \nto the reliability of the source documentation and the relevance and materiality of the facts \nproposed. Applicant confirmed his receipt of the Government\u2019s Administrative Notice \nrequest with extracts of the source documents. Applicant filed no objections to the facts \nset forth in the Government\u2019s Administrative Notice request. He declined an opportunity \nto propose additional facts for administrative notice. \n \n \nConcerning the press releases of reported criminal activity of Russian agents and \nspies and of export violations on Russia\u2019s behalf, they were presented by the Government \napparently to substantiate that Russia engages in espionage against the United States \nand actively pursues collection of U.S. economic and proprietary information. Neither \nApplicant nor his family members and friend in Russia were implicated in that criminal \nactivity. With that caveat, the facts administratively noticed are set forth below. \n \n \n\n \n \n3 \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s sister is a citizen and resident \nof Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a Russian resident citizen who \nretired from a department of the Russian government (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that Applicant has \na close friend of 50 years who is a resident citizen of Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant \nresponded to the SOR allegations, he admitted the Russian citizenship and residency of \nhis sister, brother-in-law, and longtime friend. He indicated that his sister works as a \nlawyer in Russia, but not for the Russian government, and that he has only casual and \ninfrequent communication with her. Applicant explained that his brother-in-law is a retired \nwidower, who previously worked for a private stock company that provides electricity to a \nlocal community. He stated that his brother-in-law never worked for the Russian \ngovernment and that he has had no contact with him in the last five to ten years. Applicant \nadmitted that he maintained a friendship with his old schoolmate, but they communicate \nonly a few times a year. Applicant denied that these Russian resident citizens could be a \nsource of coercion or influence for him, citing his \u201cextensive\u201d loyalty and ties to the United \nStates since 1991. \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old Russian-language interpreter. He was born in Russia \nand has one sibling, a sister, who works as a private attorney in Russia. His father was \nan engineer and his mother was a high school foreign-language teacher before their \ndeaths in 1992 and 2002, respectively. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nlinguistics with honors from a Russian university in 1983. In December 1983, he and his \nspouse married in Russia. Also a native of Russia, Applicant\u2019s spouse was educated as \na physician in Russia. He and his spouse have two sons. Their older son was born in \nRussia in April 1985. In 1987, Applicant earned a doctorate degree in philosophy in \nRussia. (GEs 1-2; AEs B-C, F-G; Tr. 52-56.) \n \nIn September 1991, Applicant came to the United States as a short-term visiting \nscholar at a public university. He came to the United States on a J-1 visa. He decided to \nstay in the United States because of the better opportunities here for his family. He \nconverted his visa status to student (F-1), and in the fall of 1992, he began studies at the \npublic university toward a Master of Business Administration degree, which was awarded \nto him in September 1994. (GE 2; AEs B-C, H; Tr. 41, 99.) In August 1992, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and son joined him in the United States. (AE B; Tr. 57.) In 1995, Applicant was \nhired by the university to administer a U.S.-government grant-funded United States-\nRussia partnership program where he managed economic development and professional \ntraining toward making Russia\u2019s academic institutions and political system more \ndemocratic. (AE B; Tr. 44, 96.) The program lasted two years, and Applicant traveled to \nRussia from March 1995 to May 1995, in October 1995, from January 1996 to February \n1996, and from May 1996 to June 1996 in support of the program. His university employer \nfunded the trips. (GE 2; Tr. 43-44.) As part of a trade initiative, he went to Russia in August \n1998 and August 1999. (GE 2.) He went to Russia for both business and pleasure in \n\n \n \n4 \nAugust 2000. He traveled to Russia annually for \u201ctourism\u201d in August 2001, August 2002, \nand September 2003. (GE 2.) \n \n  From 2000 to 2005, Applicant was employed in the United States as a program \ndirector for a small non-profit institute involved in training international participants about \nbuilding democratic institutions and free-market economies. In approximately 2000, \nApplicant began working as an independent contractor providing Russian-language \ninterpreter and translation services to private and public clients, including federal and \nstate government agencies and departments. (GE 1; AEs B-C.) He successfully passed \nthe U.S. State Department\u2019s Russian aptitude test in 1992, seminar interpreting test in \n2000, and conference interpreting test in 2004. As a federally-qualified and state-certified \ncourt interpreter, Applicant passed several background checks to provide linguistic \nsupport in federal and state courts. (AE B; Tr. 42-43.) His then employer sponsored him \nfor U.S. permanent residence. He recalls receiving his \u201cgreen card\u201d in 2001. (Tr. 96.) \n \nApplicant has provided part-time interpreter services or linguist support on a \ncontract basis for department X of the U.S. government from June 2000 to at least May \n2019 (GEs 1-2; AEs A, Q); for department Y of the U.S. government from January 2005 \nto June 2015 (GEs 1-2); and for a national laboratory involved in nuclear security issues \nfrom July 2007 to at least December 2017. (GEs 1, 3; AEs B-C; Tr. 63-65.) In 2004, and \nagain in 2009, department X of the U.S. government certified Applicant for a public trust \nposition after determining that he was a moderate risk. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 62-63.) Most of his \nwork for department X and all of his work for department Y of the U.S. government has \nbeen in the United States. (Tr. 64, 66) \n \nIn October 2008, Applicant and his spouse\u2019s younger son was born in the United \nStates. (GEs 1-2; AEs B, J; Tr. 56.) Applicant\u2019s spouse and Russian-born son acquired \nU.S. citizenship by naturalization in March 2007. (AEs I, K.) In April 2009, Applicant \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen. (GEs 1-2; AE L.) He was the main petitioner for U.S. \ncitizenship for him and his family members, and he has no explanation for the delay in \nhim obtaining his U.S. citizenship other than a huge backlog in processing petitions. (Tr. \n55.) Applicant obtained a U.S. passport in May 2009 valid for ten years. (GEs 1-2.) He \ntestified that he assumed when he took the oath of naturalization in the United States that \nhe was renouncing his Russian citizenship. (GE 2; Tr. 59, 94.) \n \nApplicant traveled to Russia on business for the national laboratory in October \n2009, and for six days in January 2010 as an interpreter for a U.S.-government \ndelegation, under the sponsorship of the national laboratory. (GE 1; Tr. 71.) He indicates \nthat he traveled on his U.S. passport in October 2009, but on his Russian passport in \nJanuary 2010. (GE 2.) His U.S. passport issued in May 2009 bears a re-entry stamp for \nthe United States dated October 30, 2009, but no obvious entry stamp for Russia or visa \nfor Russia in that passport. He did not submit in evidence a Russian passport that would \ncover that trip or the trip in January 2010, apparently because the Russian Consulate \nretained it. (GE 2.) It may be that he took both U.S. and Russian passports on his trip in \n2009 and used his Russian passport to enter Russia, although it is unclear. Applicant \ntestified that after he obtained his U.S. citizenship, he requested a visa from the Russian \n\n \n \n5 \nConsulate to travel to Russia on his U.S. passport for his interpreter work. He was advised \nthat he could not obtain a visa and that he had to extend his Russian passport to travel \nto Russia. (Tr. 58.) Applicant\u2019s Russian passport was last renewed in June 2013 for five \nyears, but he then did not take the trip to Russia. He did not renew his Russian passport \nwhen it expired in June 2018. (Tr. 58.) He regarded his renewed Russian passport as a \ntravel document only if needed to enter Russia and not as an indicia of Russian \ncitizenship. (Tr. 95.) Applicant does not expect to travel to Russia any time soon. (Tr. 62.) \nApplicant has not traveled to Russia since the trip in January 2010. (Tr. 71-72.) \n \n \nIn recent years, Applicant served as an interpreter for department X of the U.S. \ngovernment on such topics as emergency preparedness and crisis response, \nmanagement of national parks, fundraising self-sufficiency for non-governmental \norganizations, combating violent extremism, civic activism, external trade practices, and \ndisability access involving Russia or Kazakhstan. (AE C.) He completed a job assignment \nfor department X as recently as April 2019. (Tr. 65.) Applicant had an opportunity to travel \nwith a state delegation to Russia in 2018, but his Russian passport had expired so he did \nnot take the job. (Tr. 58-59.) \n \n \nIn December 2017, Applicant was offered a full-time Russian-language linguist \nposition with a defense contractor to perform interpreter services for the U.S. military \nduring a one-year deployment to Iraq at $100,000 in annual salary. The company \napproached him. The job was contingent on him obtaining a security clearance.1 (GE 2; \nTr. 35, 67.) On December 6, 2017, Applicant completed and electronically certified to the \naccuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), which he then signed \non March 1, 2018. He disclosed his dual citizenship with Russia and the United States, \nand his possession of passports from both countries. He disclosed his sister\u2019s Russian \ncitizenship and residency and her self-employment as a lawyer. He indicated that he had \nannual contact with her by telephone or electronic means. Applicant responded \naffirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he had close and/or continuing contact with \na foreign national within the last seven years with whom he or his spouse was bound by \naffection, influence, common interests, or obligation. He indicated that he had annual \ncontact by electronic means to as recently as July 2017 with his \u201cbest school friend\u201d in \nRussia. (GE 1.) \n \n \nOn January 18, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He expressed his intention to renew his \nRussian passport because he would need it as a travel document to enter Russia should \nhe ever be required to travel to Russia for work. He also stated that he was prepared to \nrelinquish his Russian passport or have the company or agency hold his Russian passport \nduring the duration of his assignment if his job required him to do so. (Tr. 60-61.) \n \n                                                 \n1 Applicant testified that the job offer \u201cis no longer kind of valid, and [he is] not going to pursue it.\u201d The \nGovernment confirmed that the company had not withdrawn its request for a security clearance for \nApplicant, and Applicant indicated that he would consider a short-term interpreter assignment. (Tr. 35-38.) \nAdequate justification existed for the hearing and adjudication process to continue.  \n\n \n \n6 \n \nOn March 1, 2018, Applicant had a counterintelligence-focused security screening \ninterview. He explained that he had taken no steps to renounce his Russian citizenship \nbecause he does not consider himself to be a citizen of Russia, and he regards his \nRussian passport as a travel document to gain entry to Russia. He explained that he had \nto renew his Russian passport because the Russian Consulate would not give him a visa \nto enter Russia on his U.S. passport. He stated that he had no problem renouncing his \nRussian citizenship, and that he considered the United States his home. He described \nRussia as his \u201cmotherland\u201d and indicated that he would like the United States and Russia \nto have good relations. Applicant denied any contact with any representatives of the \nRussian government apart from his visits to the Russian Consulate to renew his Russian \npassport over the years. If he was to face any threat or blackmail attempt, Applicant \nindicated that he would inform the appropriate authorities, although he indicated that he \nhad no concerns for the safety of family members, including those in Russia. In response \nto a question about whether he had provided any assistance to foreign persons or entities, \nhe indicated that he had transferred about $1,000 to his sister in Russia to cover part of \ntheir mother\u2019s funeral costs in September 2002. When asked whether he could conceive \nof a situation when it would be okay to betray his country (for him the United States since \n1991), he responded, \u201cNo, other than when it comes to his immediate family.\u201d He \nprofessed loyalty solely to the United States, and he demonstrated to the interviewer an \nunderstanding of the need to protect U.S. missions and secrets. (GE 2.)  \n \n \nAbout Russian contacts or relationships, Applicant related during his \ncounterintelligence-screening interview that he had annual contact with three resident \ncitizens of Russia: his sister, a self-employed attorney, who had no experience in Russia\u2019s \ngovernment or military; his spouse\u2019s brother, who had worked as an electrical technician \nfor a state-owned utility before he retired in 2013; and a school friend, who had taught \nhistory at a police academy before his retirement in 2013. Applicant indicated that his \nfather-in-law had worked for a Russian state-owned utility until his death in 2006, and that \nhis mother-in-law had been a physician in Russia before her death in 2010. Applicant \nresponded negatively to whether he, any relatives, or associates had ever been members \nor supporters of terrorist entities or state intelligence or security agencies, including the \nGlavnote Razvedyvatelnoye Upravlenie (GRU--a military intelligence agency of the \nGeneral Staff of Russia\u2019s Armed Forces) and the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezqpasnosti \n(KGB). He detailed extensive foreign travel for business and pleasure. For \ncounterintelligence purposes, the screener concluded that Applicant had the potential to \npresent a security risk because of his dual citizenship and his possession of both United \nStates and Russian passports. National intelligence agency checks and national agency \nchecks were incomplete as of the screening. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse have lived in their current home in the United States \nsince June 2000. (GE 1; AE M.) They paid off their mortgage and do not intend to move \nfrom their community. (Tr. 41, 87.) Their older son graduated from a prestigious private \nuniversity in the United States, and he currently works as a computer software engineer \nin the United States. (GE 2; AE B.) Their younger son is now ten years old. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse does not currently work outside the home. (Tr. 41, 54.) Applicant has no foreign \nassets. (Tr. 50.) He has bank, investment, and retirement account assets in the United \n\n \n \n7 \nStates of approximately $784,000. (GE 2; AE N.) He testified that his loyalty lies with the \nUnited States. (Tr. 45.) He renewed his U.S. passport in October 2018 for another ten \nyears. (AE O.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a divorced 52-year-old private attorney in her native Russia. \nShe has two daughters and two grandchildren. Applicant\u2019s last in-person contact with his \nsister was in 2001, when he was in Russia. He has traveled to Russia since then, but not \nto her area. He communicates with her a few times a year to exchange birthday and \nholiday greetings. Their last email contact was in 2013. They now communicate via social \nmedia by a messaging application approximately two to three times per year to exchange \nbirthday and New Year\u2019s greetings. He testified that he loves his sister, despite the \ninfrequency of their contact. (Tr. 90.) Applicant does not know the names of his sister\u2019s \ngrandchildren. He believes that one of his nieces works as a fashion designer. His sister \nknows he works as an interpreter but not the details of his work. She does not know that \nhe has applied for a security clearance. She has never visited him in the United States. \n(GEs 1-2; Tr. 45-47, 69-70, 72-75.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s brother is a 62-year-old widower with two adult children and \nseveral grandchildren. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law worked until his retirement for an \nelectrical power distribution company that was privatized in the 1990s. Applicant has not \nspoken to his brother-in-law since his spouse inherited approximately $10,000 from the \nsale of her mother\u2019s apartment on her mother\u2019s death in 2010. Applicant\u2019s spouse calls \nher brother on his birthday each August. Applicant considers his contact with his spouse\u2019s \nbrother as minimal. His brother-in-law is unaware that he has applied for a security \nclearance. Applicant might have seen his brother-in-law during his trip to Russia in 2001. \nHe has not had any in-person contact with him since then. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 47, 69, 76-81.) \n \n \nApplicant has casual contact a few times a year to exchange birthday and holiday \ngreetings by Skype or Viber with a longtime friend in Russia from their school days \n(grades 1-12 and university) together in Russia. This friend is a retired history professor \nwho previously worked at a Russian government-affiliated police academy. He does not \nknow Applicant has applied for a security clearance. This friend and his wife visited \nApplicant and his spouse in the United States in July 2011. They stayed in Applicant\u2019s \nhome for one week. Applicant has not seen this friend since then. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 47-48, \n69, 81-85.) Applicant admitted at his hearing that he knows other people in Russia, such \nas former classmates, but he has no ongoing communication with them. (Tr. 49.) \n \n \nApplicant does not believe that his professional judgment can be influenced by the \nfact that his sister and brother-in-law live in Russia. (Tr. 49.) Applicant does not foresee \nthat his communications with his sister, brother-in-law, and school friend in Russia will \nincrease in the future. (Tr. 50.) On January 4, 2019, Applicant submitted a statement of \nhis intention to continue to have minimal or no contact with foreign contacts outside of his \nofficial duties and with his family. He indicated that any future communications \u201cwill remain \nstrictly casual and infrequent,\u201d while acknowledging that any future communications that \nwent beyond causal and infrequent would be grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. (AE P.) When asked how he would respond to any attempt at foreign influence \n\n \n \n8 \nor coercion through his family members in Russia, Applicant testified that if he is in a \nposition of trust, his first thought would be to inform the person who entrusted him with \nthe confidential information. (Tr. 90-91.) \n \n \nApplicant has taken his work seriously over the years, including his public trust \nwork for the U.S. government. (AE A; Tr. 50.) The night following his security clearance \nhearing, Applicant was scheduled to travel to a country formerly part of the Union of Soviet \nSocialist Republics for department X of the U.S. government. Department X obtained a \nvisa for him to travel on his U.S. passport after he advised them that he no longer had a \nvalid Russian passport. (Tr. 91-92.) Applicant testified that if granted a DOD security \nclearance, he would not renew his Russian passport. (Tr. 92-93.)   \n \nCharacter References \n \n \nApplicant is reported to have provided reliable and unbiased translation services \nover the years in the exchanges between Russian and American academics and political \nleaders arranged by a voluntary association of persons interested in improving relations \nand understanding between the United States and Russia. He became an indispensable \nmember of the team and earned the respect and trust of participants on both sides. (AE \nA.) \n  \n \nThe state university where Applicant earned his MBA degree has relied on his \nservices as a Russian-language translator and interpreter since 1992. A project manager \nat the university\u2019s translation center attests to the professionalism and accuracy of \nApplicant\u2019s work. He indicates that he \u201ccannot give a high enough recommendation that \nwould adequately reflect [Applicant\u2019s] work.\u201d (AE A.) \n \n \nA language specialist with department X of the U.S. government indicates that \nApplicant has worked with Russian-speaking international visitors participating in \ndepartment X\u2013sponsored programs since 2001. Applicant has proven to be among the \nmost experienced and reliable interpreters for his office, and he has earned appreciation \nand praise from the office. The language specialist attests that the office plans to continue \noffering Applicant interpreter assignments in the future. Applicant has been professional, \nreliable, and trustworthy in fulfilling his assigned tasks. He believes Applicant can be \ntrusted. (AE A.) \n \n \nAn international trade specialist with department Y of the U.S. government worked \ndirectly with Applicant from 2009 to 2015. She described Applicant\u2019s interpreter skills as \n\u201ctop notch.\u201d He consistently delivered high-quality work during rigorous three and four-\nweek programs involving travel across the United States. Applicant was able to handle \ntechnical interpretations in many different industries, and he served as a cultural guide. \n(AE A.) \n \n \nThe manager of operations for a U.S.-based foreign language translation service \nindicates that the company would not hesitate to use Applicant\u2019s interpreter skills in the \nfuture. Applicant\u2019s mastery of both Russian and English languages and his \n\n \n \n9 \nprofessionalism have led the company to use his services at numerous seminars and \nconferences in the United States and elsewhere for several years. Feedback from clients \nhas been positive for his knowledge and professionalism. (AE A.) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n   \n \nRussia is a highly centralized, authoritarian political system dominated by \nPresident Vladimir Putin. Its bicameral federal assembly lacks independence from the \nexecutive branch. The United States and Russia established diplomatic relations in \nDecember 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. There is currently a low \nlevel of trust between the United States and Russia because of Russia\u2019s efforts to \ninfluence the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine U.S. democratic institutions \nand because of Russia\u2019s recent and ongoing aggressive economic espionage targeting \nU.S. companies and trade secrets. Russian civilian and military intelligence services have \nbeen implicated in a campaign of cyber operations directed at the U.S. government and \nits citizens, which include spear-phishing campaigns targeting government organizations, \ncritical infrastructure, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations; \ntheft of information; and public release of some of this information. Russia has recently \nassumed a more assertive cyber posture based on its willingness to target critical \ninfrastructure systems and conduct espionage operations. In addition to cyberspace, \nRussia uses commercial and academic enterprises that interact with the West, \nrecruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills, and Russian \nintelligence penetration of public and private enterprises, to obtain sensitive technical \ninformation from U.S. industries. (GE 4.) \n \n \nIn October 2015, three employees of a U.S. company were convicted of conspiring \nto export and of illegally exporting sophisticated technology (controlled microelectronics) \nto Russia between October 2008 and October 2012. In May 2016, an agent of Russia\u2019s \nforeign intelligence agency (SVR) working under non-official cover as a bank employee \nin Manhattan was sentenced to 30 months in prison for attempting to collect economic \nintelligence and recruit New York City residents as intelligence sources for Russia. He \nconspired with a trade representative of the Russian government in New York from 2010 \nto 2014 and with an attach\u00e9 to Russia\u2019s Permanent Mission to the United Nations from \n2012 to 2013. (GE 4.) \n  \n \nIn March 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice obtained indictments of two \nRussian Federal Security Service officials and their Russian cybercriminal conspirators \non computer hacking and conspiracy charges related to the collection of emails of U.S. \nand European employees of transportation and financial services firms. In August 2017, \na U.S. citizen pleaded guilty to conspiring to smuggle and illegally export radiation- \nhardened integrated circuits to Russia and China between June 2015 and March 2016. \nIn September 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security directed federal \ndepartments and agencies to remove Kaspersky Lab products and services based on the \ninformation security risks posed by the company and its links to Russia. In March 2018, \na Florida man pleaded guilty to conspiring with customers in Russia to illegally export \nnight-vision rifle scopes and a thermal multi-purpose monocular to Russia in 2013. In July \n\n \n \n10 \n2018, a resident citizen of Russia, who owns a privately-held Russian microelectronics \nimport/export company, was indicted in a U.S. federal district court for conspiracy to \ncommit money laundering, conspiracy to smuggle sensitive electronics to Russian military \nand intelligence agencies, and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Powers \nAct. (GE 4.) \n \n \nIn early October 2018, seven officers of the GRU were indicted in a U.S. federal \ndistrict court for computer hacking, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money \nlaundering. The GRU officers are alleged to have conspired between December 2014 \nand at least May 2018 in conducting persistent and sophisticated computer intrusions \naffecting U.S. persons, corporate entities, international organizations, and their respective \nemployees based on their strategic interest to the Russian government. Two of the GRU \nofficials were charged with conspiring to gain unauthorized access to computers of U.S. \npersons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from \nthose computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere with the \nelection. In mid-October 2018, a Russian national was charged in the United States with \nconspiring to interfere with the U.S. political system, including the 2018 midterm election. \nWhile serving as chief accountant of a Russian umbrella effort funding by a Russian \noligarch to spread distrust of U.S. candidates and the U.S. political system and to defraud \nthe United States, she allegedly played a central financial management role in a \ndisinformation campaign through social media platforms to create and amplify divisive \nsocial and political content targeting U.S. audiences. In December 2018, the U.S. State \nDepartment added 12 individuals and entities to the List of Specified Persons pursuant to \nSection 231 of the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries through Sanctions Act for being part \nof, or operating for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors of the Russian \ngovernment. The U.S. intelligence community believes Russia will remain a major threat \nto U.S. government, military, diplomatic, commercial, and critical infrastructure. (GE 4.) \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department issued a Level 2 travel advisory for Russia in \nDecember 2018, advising U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution due to terrorism, \nharassment, and the arbitrary enforcement of local laws in Russia. U.S. citizens are \nadvised that terrorist groups, transnational and local terrorist organizations, and \nindividuals inspired by extremist ideology continue plotting possible attacks in Russia and \nthat terrorists may attack with little or no warning places frequented by tourists. \nAdditionally, U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Russia have been arbitrarily interrogated \nor detained by Russian officials and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, \nand extortion. Russia enforces special restrictions on dual U.S.-Russian nationals and \nmay refuse to acknowledge their U.S. citizenship, including denying U.S. consular \nassistance to detained dual nationals and preventing their departure from Russia. The \nU.S. government has assessed Moscow as being a high-threat location for terrorism, \ncrime, and political violence directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. (GE \n4.) \n \n \nSerious human rights abuses persisted in Russia in 2017 as Russia continues to \ntrain, equip, lead, and fight alongside pro-Russian forces in regions of eastern Ukraine \nsince the occupation and \u201cannexation\u201d of Crimea in March 2014. The United States \n\n \n \n11 \nconsiders Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea to be unlawful and in violation of Ukrainian and \ninternational law, and has suspended most bilateral engagement with the Russian \ngovernment on economic issues. Russian authorities conducted politically motivated \narrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia. Russian authorities \ncontinued to severely restrict the ability of Russia\u2019s citizens to choose their government \nthrough free and fair elections and to exercise freedoms of expression, assembly, \nassociation, and movement. Russian authorities blocked and filtered Internet content and \nused cyberattacks to disrupt peaceful Internet discussion. Widespread corruption \npersisted in all branches of government. Extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, \ntorture, lack of judicial independence, harsh and life-threatening conditions in prisons, \nand arbitrary arrest and detention, were among the most significant human rights abuses \nin Russia in 2017. (GE 4.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n \n12 \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s only sibling, his brother-in-law, and his longtime friend since childhood \nare Russian resident citizens. Review of Applicant\u2019s contacts and connections to these \nforeign citizens is warranted to determine whether they present a heightened risk under \nAG \u00b6 7(a) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those disqualifying \nconditions provide: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \n\n \n \n13 \nmember living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the family ties or \nother foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing \nwhether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the foreign \ngovernment; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United \nStates. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the administrative judge must \ntake into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case \nNo. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \n \nApplicant understandably has bonds of affection for his sister, his only sibling, even \nthough his contact with her is only two or three times a year by a social media messaging \napplication. Regarding his brother-in-law, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of his or her \nspouse. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-12659 (App. Bd. May 30, 2013). The evidence does \nnot indicate that Applicant has close ties to his spouse\u2019s brother. They have not talked \nsince approximately 2010. His spouse contacts her brother at least annually on his \nbirthday, and so the risk of undue influence through his spouse must be considered. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his friend from their school days is longstanding and is \nmaintained by contact by Skype or Viber a few times a year. This friend and his wife \nvisited Applicant and his spouse for one week in the United States in approximately 2011. \nThere is nothing untoward about these contacts. A heightened risk exists, however, \nbecause Applicant\u2019s spouse, brother-in-law, and longtime friend are resident citizens of \nRussia, a country with a long history of espionage against the United States and, in recent \nyears, also cybercrime targeting U.S. interests to steal sensitive information and \ntechnologies and undermine the country\u2019s democratic institutions and stability. Given \nRussia\u2019s poor human rights record in several aspects, the possibility of Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers and friend being coerced, pressured, or even arrested in an attempt to gain \ninformation from Applicant cannot be ruled out. Applicant\u2019s friend is now retired, but from \nemployment as a professor at a Russian state-run police academy. Applicant\u2019s foreign \nrelationships and albeit infrequent contacts create a heightened risk and a possible \nsecurity concern about his desire to help his relatives and friend living in Russia by \nproviding classified information. Foreign influence disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) are established.  \n \nThe burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the risk of undue foreign influence that \nexists because of his ties to Russia, a country known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information. AG \u00b6 8(a) provides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States.  \n \n\n \n \n14 \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. Russia\u2019s long history of aggressive espionage from \nwithin and outside the United States targeting classified and sensitive military and \ntechnological information, and its recent cyber hacking of emails of U.S. citizens and \npolitical entities, increase the risk that Applicant could find himself in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of his foreign family members and friend and the interests \nof the United States. His sister\u2019s work as a private attorney could raise the attention of \nRussian authorities, and his friend would be known to his former colleagues at the police \nacademy. \n \nApplicant denies any loyalty to Russia or its institutions, but he retains a significant \ntie through his Russian citizenship. Although the United States does not prohibit dual \ncitizenship, it does not encourage it because of the conflicting obligations that may ensue \nto the foreign country. Were he to travel to Russia, Applicant might not be able to count \non the protections of his U.S. citizenship because of his dual nationality. Furthermore, it \nis difficult to conclude that the bonds of affection to his sister are so minimal to satisfy the \nfirst part of AG \u00b6 8(b), which provides: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships and loyalties in the United States are so deep and \nlongstanding that he can be counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. \nIn that regard, he has established strong ties to the United States over the last 25 years. \nHe came to the United States on a short-term visa as a J-1 scholar visa in 1991. He \ndecided to remain in the United States because of better healthcare and education \nopportunities for his family, and his spouse and son joined him in the United States a year \nlater. He earned an MBA degree from the university and managed a U.S.-government-\nfunded program for the public university for a couple of years. Applicant and his spouse \npurchased their current home in 2000, and he started a successful career as a freelance \nRussian-language interpreter. In June 2000, he began providing linguist services for \ndepartment X of the U.S. government. He was vetted favorably for a public trust position \nby the department in 2004 and again in 2009, and was scheduled to travel abroad for \ndepartment X after his May 2019 hearing. Applicant also provided interpreter services for \nU.S. department Y for about a decade starting in January 2005. Among his other clients, \nincluding state governments and federal and state courts, Applicant provided interpreter \nservices for a national laboratory involved in nuclear security issues from July 2007 to at \nleast December 2017. He traveled to Russia for the laboratory in October 2009 and \nJanuary 2010, but has not been to Russia since then. Most of his work involving Russia \nhas been in the United States. All of Applicant\u2019s financial assets are in the United States, \nand they are more than sufficient to meet his family\u2019s financial obligations. \n \nUnder the sponsorship of his then employer, Applicant obtained his \u201cgreen card\u201d \nin 2001. Under his own application, he acquired U.S. citizenship through naturalization in \n\n \n \n15 \n2009. His spouse and the elder of his sons became naturalized citizens in 2007, and his \nyounger son was born in the United States in October 2008. Applicant obtained his first \nU.S. passport in May 2009. He used his U.S. passport for all his foreign travel, but to \nenter Russia in January 2010 and also likely in October 2009. He renewed his U.S. \npassport in October 2018. \n \nApplicant testified that he assumed that his Russian citizenship was renounced \nwhen he took the oath of naturalization in the United States in April 2009, although he \nwas alerted that he retained his Russian citizenship when he tried unsuccessfully to \nobtain a visa to travel to Russia on his U.S. passport. He traveled to Russia in October \n2009 and January 2010. During counterintelligence screening in March 2018, he \nindicated that he used his U.S. passport in October 2009 and his Russian passport in \nJanuary 2010. His U.S. passport does not show any entry stamp for Russia in October \n2009, although it bears a re-entry stamp for the United States. By January 2010 if not by \nOctober 2009, Applicant knew that he retained Russian citizenship. He did not use his \nRussian passport that was valid for five years on renewal in May 2013, and he did not \nrenew it when it expired in May 2018. His retention of his Russian citizenship is not \ninconsistent with his U.S. citizenship because U.S. law and the Directive do not prohibit \ndual citizenship. Even so, he has expressed a credible willingness to renounce his \nRussian citizenship if required, since his loyalty and life are with the United States, where \nhe has spent the past 28 years. His ties to the United States significantly outweigh those \nto his native Russia. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies in this case. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation,\u201d warrants some consideration because of the limited communication \nbetween Applicant and his sibling and friend and between Applicant\u2019s spouse and her \nbrother. Yet, the closeness of the sibling bond and of friendship lasting some 50 years \npreclude a finding that the contacts are casual. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Those factors are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n \n16 \nRussian authorities could conceivably bring some pressure on Applicant\u2019s sibling, \nhis spouse\u2019s sibling, or his friend to gain influence or information from him. People act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a family member. \nAs stated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, \n2009), \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but \nmerely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with \nchoices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family member.\u201d Moreover, in \nevaluating Guideline B concerns, the Appeal Board has held that: \n \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \n \nApplicant cannot control the actions of the Russian government, intelligence, or \nsecurity services, but he can control his response if placed in the untenable position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests of his family \nmembers or friend. He indicated that if undue pressure were to be placed on him, he \nwould contact the authority that entrusted him with the confidential or sensitive \ninformation. Although not controlling, it is relevant that Applicant has twice been vetted by \nanother department of the U.S. government and determined eligible for a public trust \nposition. He has worked for the U.S. government, primarily in the United States but also \nabroad, for the past 19 years, and demonstrated professionalism, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. There is no indication whatsoever that he has betray the confidence \nplaced in him. After considering all the facts and circumstances, I find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n \n17 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On Jenuary 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence. (Item 1.) The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \ndated June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 8, 2019. He admitted all the SOR \nallegations except for subparagraph 1.g. regarding a second bank account. He \nrequested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record \nwithout a hearing. (Item 1.) On February 28, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ncontaining three Items, was mailed to Applicant on February 28, 2019, and received by \nhim on March 29, 2019. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of \nhis receipt of the FORM. Applicant failed to respond to the FORM. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \n \n \nIn the FORM, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Israel. Department Counsel provided a five-page summary of the facts, \nsupported by eight Government documents pertaining to Israel, identified as Additional \nInformation. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \nout after the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. He is married, with one minor child. (Item 2 at pages 5, \n25, and 37.).) \n \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \n \n \n1.a. Applicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel, and \nresides in Israel. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Israel. \n \n \n1.c.~1.e. Applicant\u2019s three siblings, a sister and two brothers, are dual citizens of \nthe United States and Israel, and reside in Israel. \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admits that he has a bank account in Israel, valued at about $600. \n \n \n1.g. Applicant denies that he has a second bank account in Israel, valued at \nabout $1,800. As the Government only refers to \u201ca bank account\u201d in the FORM, this \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.h. Applicant admits that he has two Israeli pension accounts valued at about \n$43,000 on his retirement. \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admits that he is making monthly payments to the Government of \nIsrael for Israeli social security and medical insurance.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nNotice \n \n \n \nAlthough The United States has provided regular military support to Israel, there \nis a significant documented history of classified information and export-controlled \ntechnologies being illegally imported by Israel. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest.  \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings are Israeli citizens living in Israel. He also has a \nbank account, pension accounts, and makes monthly payment to the Israeli \ngovernment. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant has submitted no evidence demonstrating that that any of these \nmitigating conditions apply. Foreign Influence is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility, and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. He has not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder the guideline for Foreign Influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h. and 1.i.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

He received his primary education through a private school because his village did not have its own school. He worked at the family-owned grocery shop in the village. His family in Somalia includes his mother, a sister, one brother, and two half-brothers. Applicant is uncertain if his other sister lives in Central or Southern Africa. His father passed away in 2006. (Tr. 18-26, 35; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3) In 2009, Applicant left Somalia and was admitted into a refugee camp in the Netherlands after he requested asylum.

National security eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 16, 2017, Applicant completed and signed his security clearance \napplication (SCA). On November 23, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 18, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. He admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, but he \ndenied \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. On August 15, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On August 30, \n\n \n2 \n \n2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, \nsetting the hearing for September 16, 2019.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 3, and Applicant offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. I admitted all exhibits into \nevidence without objection. Applicant and one witness testified. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on September 30, 2019. I held the record open for one month in \nthe event either party wanted to submit additional documentation. Applicant timely \nsubmitted two letters or recommendation and corrections he made on the hearing \ntranscript that was provided to him. I admitted his documents, AE B through D, without \nobjection. The record closed on October 16, 2019. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAdministrative Notice  \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Somalia. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained \nin the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision.  \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Somalia: \n \n \nIn 2012, Somalia was established as a federal parliamentary republic. The United \nStates recognized the Federal Government of Somalia in January 2013. U.S. foreign \npolicy objectives in Somalia are to promote economic and political stability, promote \ndemocratic reforms, oppose international terrorism, and alleviate humanitarian crisis \ncaused by conflict and poor weather conditions.  \n \n \nThe United States supports the success of the African Union Mission in driving Al-\nShabaab, a terrorist organization, out of strategically important population centers. The \nUnited States provided more than $3 billion in assistance to Somalia from 2006 to present. \nThe United States supports and works closely with Somalia to establish an effective and \nrepresentative security sector including military, police, and justice officials.  \n \n \nThe State Department has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory for Somalia advising \nU.S. citizens not to travel to Somalia due to crime, terrorism, and piracy. Violent crime is \ncommon throughout Somalia, and criminals target foreigners. Terrorism is an ongoing \nthreat throughout Somalia. The State Department designated Somali-based Al-Shabaab \nas a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Al-Shabaab has frequently attacked a variety of \ntargets in Somalia with a wide range of weapons and explosives. In four attacks in 2017, \nAl-Shabaab killed more than 100 people. The majority of those killed in the four attacks \nwere soldiers and police officers.  \n \n \nIn Somalia, human rights abuses occur primarily because of Al-Shabaab\u2019s lawless \nbehavior. Some government officials have also engaged in rapes, extortions, and \nmurders with impunity. \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. He was born in a small village in Somalia. He received \nhis primary education through a private school because his village did not have its own \nschool. He worked at the family-owned grocery shop in the village. His family in Somalia \nincludes his mother, a sister, one brother, and two half-brothers. Applicant is uncertain if \nhis other sister lives in Central or Southern Africa. His father passed away in 2006. (Tr. \n18-26, 35; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3) \n \n \nIn 2009, Applicant left Somalia and was admitted into a refugee camp in the \nNetherlands after he requested asylum. He said his country and the government were in \nchaos. While residing in the Netherlands, he met a woman who was a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen, and they were married in a religious ceremony, but not a legally recognized \nceremony in the U.S. She returned to the U.S. in early 2012, and Applicant\u2019s son was \nborn in the United States in November 2012. (Tr. 18-26, 35; GE 1) \n \n \nIn February 2014, Applicant immigrated to the U.S. on a fianc\u00e9 visa. He legally \nmarried his wife about a week after his arrival. They had another son in November 2015. \nApplicant worked as a truck driver, and his spouse worked in a warehouse. He became \na naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2017. He and his spouse separated in about September \n2017. During their separation, his spouse gave birth to his daughter in 2018. As of the \ndate of the hearing, they were still separated, but Applicant and his wife were working to \nrepair their relationship and reunite. Applicant has never returned to Somalia since he \nentered the U.S. in 2014. All members of his family are U.S. citizens. He considers himself \nan American and intends to raise his family in his adopted and beloved country. (Tr. 24-\n32, 65) \n \nForeign Influence: \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is approximately 74 years old. She is a citizen and resident of \nSomalia. One of his sisters, also a citizen and resident of Somalia, lives with his mother \nin their village home. They continue to operate the family\u2019s grocery shop. His mother owns \na cell phone, and Applicant cannot speak with his mother while she is in the village due \nto connectivity limitations. His mother calls Applicant whenever she visits the city where \nshe is able to obtain cell phone service. Applicant sometimes goes as long as three to \nfour months without hearing from his mother. There are times Applicant speaks briefly \nwith his sister during these phone calls. He sends his mother financial assistance on \napproximately a monthly basis. He sends the money through a registered money service \nbusiness, and his mother must pick up the funds at a bank in the city. Applicant described \nhis mother and family members in Somalia as simple people with extremely limited \nincome. His family members have no connections with the Government or military of \nSomalia. (Tr. 34-42) \n \n  \nApplicant is not certain where his second sister is currently living, but believes she \nmay be in South or Central Africa. They last spoke in 2015 when she called him \nrequesting money because she was sick. Since 2015, Applicant has not had any contact \nwith this sister. (Tr. 43-44, 66)    \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant clarified at the hearing that he has one older brother and two younger \nhalf-brothers. Department Counsel requested that the SOR be amended to properly \nreflect this accurate information, which I granted without objection. Applicant did not grow \nup with his older brother because he lived in the rural area of Somalia, and was possibly \nraising goats. Applicant has not had any communication with his brother until about two \nyears ago, when his brother called him. His brother asked for financial help because his \nwife was sick. Applicant sent him about $200, and they have not communicated since \n2017. (Tr. 44-49) \n \n \nApplicant does not have contact with his two younger half-brothers. They also live \nin the rural area of Somalia, possibly raising goats. Applicant reported that the majority of \nSomalians, approximately 60%, are nomads living in rural areas of Somalia. He reiterated \nthat his family is considered simple folk, and he does not have any assets in Somalia. (Tr. \n50-51) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the counter-intelligence security-screening \ndocument contained inaccurate information that he wanted to correct. There was a \nreference to Applicant stating that he knew a Somalian army general and he spoke to him \non a weekly basis. This information supported an allegation alleged in the SOR. (\u00b6 1.c) \nApplicant explained that when he lived in the village, an older man visited his family\u2019s \ngrocery shop to purchase food. He believed the man had previously served in the \nSomalian army, and the people in the village nicknamed the elderly man \u201cthe General.\u201d \nApplicant got to know \u201cthe General\u201d due to him being a regular customer. In addition, \nApplicant attended private school with \u201cthe General\u2019s\u201d son, whom he considers his friend. \nApplicant has had infrequent contact with his friend over the years. When the U.S. \ngovernment interviewer asked Applicant if he knew anyone who worked for the \nGovernment or military of Somalia, he disclosed his connection to \u201cthe General\u201d in an \neffort to be completely forthright. Applicant denied ever stating that he communicated with \n\u201cthe General\u201d on a weekly basis. As indicated in his SOR response, Applicant was \ninformed that \u201cthe General\u201d passed away in early 2018. (Tr. 54-62; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant testified that the U.S. government interviewer also asked him to disclose \nsomeone who could verify his occupancy at the refugee camp in the Netherlands. \nApplicant provided the name of an individual from Somalia he met at the refugee camp, \nwho now resides in Germany. Applicant stated that this individual was more of an \nacquaintance, not a personal friend, and the last time they communicated was in early \n2018 using social media. (Tr. 62-65; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant submitted character reference letters from two co-workers, who both \npraised Applicant\u2019s diligence, efficiency, and honesty. They recommended Applicant be \ngranted a security clearance as he would be an excellent linguist. (AE B, AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n5 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \n\n \n6 \n \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise security \nconcerns, and the following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \n \nThere is a threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights violations in Somalia. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, through his family \nmembers. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence \n \n \nThe conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States. The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must \nbe made with caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly.  \n \n \nThere are widely-documented safety issues for residents of Somalia because of \nterrorists and insurgents. The mere possession of close family ties with one or more family \nmembers living in Somalia is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B; \nhowever, if an applicant has a close relationship with even one relative living in a foreign \ncountry, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See Generally ISCR Case \nNo. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, the government ignores the rule of law including widely accepted civil \nliberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the \ngovernment is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a substantial amount of \ndeath or property damage, or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection \noperations against the United States. The relationship of Somalia with the United States, \nand the situation in Somalia places a significant, but not insurmountable burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with his family living in \nSomalia does not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position \nwhere he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to \nassist a relative living in Somalia. \n \n \nI found Applicant\u2019s testimony describing himself as a loyal U.S. citizen to be \ncredible and sincere. His wife and three children are in the United States and are U.S. \ncitizens. His communications with his mother, sister, and friend are infrequent. His \ncommunications with his brother, two half-brothers, and other sister are extremely rare. I \nfind that Applicant\u2019s ties to Somalia are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. His closest family, home, and all of his \nassets are in the U.S. He swore an oath of allegiance to the U.S. as part of the citizenship \nprocess. He is willing to serve as a linguist overseas supporting U.S. goals. Applicant \ndescribed his family in Somalia as \u201csimple people\u201d living in a small village and in the rural \nareas with no connection to the Government or military of Somalia. I find that it is unlikely \nhe will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United \n\n \n8 \n \nStates and the interests of Somalia. There is no conflict of interest, because Applicant \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8 \n(a), (b), and (c) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \n \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility.  \n \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to foreign family members in Somalia are limited. \nHis connections to the United States taken together, including his spouse and three \nchildren who are U.S. citizens, and his willingness to support U.S. goals as a linguist are \nsufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B. After \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

(Government Exhibit 1.)  On January 4, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse; and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the \nDoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 13, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct  \n \n \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal activity that \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.   \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in conduct which shows a \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that \nraise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \n \nAt the young age of 13, Applicant started using illegal drugs recreationally like his \nfriends.  It began with marijuana and alcohol.  As time passed, his drug use got \nprogressively worse, and escalated to crack cocaine and speed.  He later turned to \nmethamphetamine and heroin.  \n \n \nApplicant grew up in downtown Los Angeles with the gangs and drugs and was a \nby-product of the environment.  He states that he is also a by-product of rape.  He had \nno father ever involved in his life.  His mother was simply trying to survive.  Each of his \nsiblings have different fathers.  Between December 1997 and June 1999, Applicant \ncommitted various criminal offenses.  In December 1997, he was arrested and charged \nwith robbery.  In March 1998, he was arrested and charged with grand theft auto.  In \nMay 1998, he was arrested again for grand theft auto.  In June 1999, he was arrested \nand charged with vehicle theft.  At the age of 15 was the first time he went to Juvenile \nHall.  Applicant spent at least three years total in Juvenile Hall for the previously \nmentioned offenses.     \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAfter getting out of juvenile hall, Applicant was homeless.  He ran away from the \nyouth authority program because he was raped by another inmate.  He admits to having \na hard time adjusting to the outside world.  To maintain his drug habit, Applicant \ncontinued to commit crimes.  In February 2003 he was charged with burglary and \ndisorderly conduct.  He was convicted and spent eight months in prison.  In December \n2003 he was charged with burglary and vehicle theft.  He was convicted and spent 16 \nmonths in prison.  He was incarcerated from September 2004 to October 2005.  In \nOctober 2005, Applicant was charged with driving while license suspended.  He was \nconvicted and sentenced to 2 years of probation.   In January 2006, Applicant was \ncharged with possession of a controlled substance, crack cocaine.  He was convicted \nand sentenced to 3 years of probation.  In June 2006, Applicant was charged with \npossession of a controlled substance.  He was convicted and sentenced to three years \nof probation.  In August 2006, Applicant was charged with vandalism.  Applicant was \nconvicted and sentenced to two years of probation.   \n \n \nIn August 2007 Applicant was charged with burglary in the first degree and \nattempted burglary of a house. He was convicted and sentenced to nine years and four \nmonths in prison.  Applicant was incarcerated from August 2007 to October 2016 and \nremains on parole until October 2019. \n \n \nApplicant did nine years and four months in prison.  The skills he has that he put \non his current job application, he acquired on his own while he was in prison.  He was \nnever able to put those skills to use until now.  To survive the nine years and four \nmonths in prison, Applicant, who had great artistic talent, became a very famous tattoo \nartist.  His artwork was well respected and he could get anything he wanted at any time \nwhile in prison.   Thus, illegal drugs were always available to him.  When he got out of \nprison, he worked at Home Boy Industries and went to school for thermals and designs \nand was sponsored by them.  Applicant excelled.  He then started applying for other \njobs and was hired and worked for another aerospace company for about four months \nbefore he was contacted by his current employer and eventually hired.     \n \n \nWhile in prison, Applicant applied for a job with his current employer.  About eight \nmonths or so after he applied, he was contacted.  By this time, Applicant had been \nreleased from prison.  Applicant was interviewed in April 2017 and at that time he told \nthem everything about his past criminal record, drug history, and time in prison.  When \nApplicant applied for the job, he was not aware that he needed a security clearance.  He \ninitially applied for a tool and die maker.  During his interview with the defense \ncontractor, who obviously saw potential in the Applicant, he was told that at some point \nhe may need a security clearance.  The defense contractor also told the Applicant that \nthey would help him fill out the security clearance application if he needed help.  \nApplicant was surprised to learn that he got the job and would be starting his \nemployment in August 2017.  His employer conducted an investigation into his \nbackground, and so when he began his employment in August 2017 he was given an \ninterim clearance. \n \n \nAfter getting out of prison, in October 2016, Applicant continued to use marijuana \nand alcohol.  He started using it a couple times a week, and as time passed, his use \n\n \n4 \n \nincreased.  He stated that he last used marijuana about a month before the hearing.  \n(Tr. p. 44.)  Applicant also started using methamphetamine and heroin again.  In August \n2018 Applicant desperately wanted help from his employer for his addiction.  Applicant \nwent to the person who hired him and showed him the tracks on his arm.  Applicant \nadmits that he has overdosed twice, once in prison, and once when he got out.  He also \nadmits that he has been diagnosed with Meth-related Psychosis and Post Traumatic \nStress Disorder.  With the help of his employer, Applicant entered a full time-recovery \nprogram.  This was the first time in his life that Applicant felt that he has ever received \nreal help for his addiction.  This inpatient treatment program began on August 27, 2018, \nand Applicant successfully completed all levels of the treatment on January 25, 2019.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  Applicant provided psychiatric progress notes dated January 2, \n2019, and January 23, 2019, indicating that Applicant was prescribed several \nmedications as well as daily group and individual psychotherapy and support or \nancillary service in order for the psychiatric care to have maximum benefit for his \nrecovery.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and C.)  Applicant testified that he found the program \nto be extremely helpful and life changing.  Robert Downey Jr. walked up to him at the \nrecovery center and told him that they share the same story.  Applicant was accepted \nfor who he was, was weaning himself from his addiction, and working hard to improve \nhis life.  (Tr. p. 51.)  \n \n \nFrom 1998 to December 2017, Applicant used a number of illegal drugs to either \nescape his reality or because he was addicted and could not control the urge.  He also \npurchased illegal drugs during this period.  After he started working for his current \nemployer, and after being granted an interim security clearance in July 2017, Applicant \ncontinued to use illegal drugs.  After successfully completing the treatment program, \nApplicant relapsed and used marijuana and alcohol.  After receiving the SOR from the \ngovernment concerning his security clearance, Applicant made the decision to stop \nusing alcohol and illegal drugs altogether.  Applicant currently attends NA/AA meetings \non a weekly basis and he has an AA sponsor.  He is currently working the twelve steps \nof AA and is on Step 2.  Applicant admits that over the years he has tried to stop using \nalcohol and drugs on his own, but was never able to conquer it by himself.  He now has \nhelp and is doing much better than ever before.  Applicant states that his supervisor and \nco-workers know all about his past criminal and illegal drug history.  \n \n \nOn March 29, 2017, Applicant completed a security clearance application (EQIP).  \nSection 22- Police Record, asked the Applicant if any of the following have happened?  \nIn the past seven years has the Applicant been or is he currently on probation or \nparole?  Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  This was a false answer.  He failed to disclose that \nhe was on parole, which started in October 2016 and ended in October 2019.   \n \n \nOn the same application, under Section 22 \u2013 \u201cPolice Record, the Applicant was \nasked a series of questions, Other than those offenses already listed, has the Applicant \never had the following happen to him?. . . Has he ever been convicted in any court of \nthe United States of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year for \nthat crime, and incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than 1 year? . . . \nHas he ever been charged with any felony offense?. . . Has he ever been charged with \n\n \n5 \n \nan offense involving alcohol or drugs?\u201d  Applicant answered, \u201cNO,\u201d to these questions.  \nThese were false answers.  Applicant failed to disclose the conviction set forth above.  \n \nOn the same application, under Section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, \nthe question asked, In the last seven years, has the Applicant illegally used any drugs \nor controlled substances?  Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d  This was a false answer.  \nApplicant failed to list his history of illegal drug use including marijuana, crack cocaine, \nmethamphetamine and heroin.   \n \nOn the same application, under Section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, \nthe question asked, In the last seven years has the Applicant been involved in the illegal \npurchase, manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, \nhandling or sale of any drug or controlled substance?  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d  \nThis was a false answer.  He failed to list the illegal drugs he purchased for his use \ndiscussed above.  \n \nApplicant does not understand why he answered, \u201cNO\u201d to these questions and is \nnot certain if he actually did.  In any case, he testified that he was afraid that if he \ndisclosed the information on the application, he would not get his security clearance.  \nHe also swore under oath that the information he provided was true and honest to the \nbest of his ability.  (Tr. p. 66.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n  \n\n \n6 \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which is \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nApplicant committed numerous violations of the law, escalating to his last arrest \nand conviction, which was a felony.  He has two strikes against him and a third would \nhave prevented him from ever being released from prison.  As a minor he spent about \nthree years of his life in Juvenile Hall.  As an adult, he spent over ten years in prison, his \nlast stint being nine years and four months of his life.  Applicant remains on parole until \nOctober 2019.  The aforementioned disqualifying conditions have been established.  \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance, with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nThere is no question that Applicant is working hard to improve his life.  He has \nnot engaged in any crimes against others since he was released from prison.  \nHopefully, he will continue to improve his life and stay crime free.  However, at this time, \nhis long history of criminal conduct obviously aggravated by his exposure to excessive \nstreet violence and other crimes creates doubt concerning his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness, and ability or willingness to abide by law, rules, and regulations.  None \nof the mitigating conditions establish full mitigation.  \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \n\n \n8 \n \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains four conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia, and  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of substance use disorder; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation.  Over the past 24 \nyears, Applicant has abused a number of illegal drugs.  Since prison, he has changed \n\n \n9 \n \nhis associations and the environment where drugs were once prevalent.  However even \nafter getting out of prison, and then after being hired by a defense contractor, and \nissued an interim clearance, he continued to use illegal drugs.  Even after completing an \ninpatient treatment program for his drug addiction, he relapsed.  He has now made a \ncommitment to remain drug and alcohol free and live a sober lifestyle.  He is \ncommended for this recent decision to make a permanent life style change and is \nencouraged to continue working to improve his life.  Time will only tell.  With hard work \nand discipline, Applicant may eventually get to where he wants to go, as the rewards for \ngood conduct are priceless, but at this time he has not yet conquered his addiction.  At \nthis time, his actions do no show the requisite good judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information.        \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n10 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Applicant answered, \u201cNO,\u201d to \nquestions on his security clearance questionnaire concerning his police record, and \nillegal drug abuse, that he should clearly have admitted.  There is no excuse for this \ndishonesty which calls his character into question.  Considered in totality, Applicant\u2019s \nconduct precludes a finding of good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  To be \nentrusted with the privilege of holding a security clearance, one is expected to be \nhonest and truthful at all times, and to know and understand the rules and regulations \nthat apply to them, and to always abide by those rules.  Under the particular facts of this \ncase, Applicant has not demonstrated this awareness.  By failing to answer these \nquestions correctly on the security clearance application, his conduct does not show \nhonesty, integrity, good judgment or reliability.  At this time, Applicant does not meet the \nqualifications for access to classified information.     \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n11 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline J, Guideline H, and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis.  To hold a \nsecurity clearance is a privilege and not a right.  While holding a security clearance one \nis expected to show honesty, responsibility and good judgment at all times.  Applicant \nhas not demonstrated a positive pattern of conduct and the level of maturity needed for \naccess to classified information.  At this time, he is not an individual with whom the \nGovernment can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and regulations \nand do the right thing, even when no one is looking.  Right now, he is not qualified for \naccess to classified information, nor is it certain that sensitive information will be \nproperly protected.  Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Criminal Conduct, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Abuse, and Personal Conduct security concerns.    \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, through 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a, through 2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a, through 3.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 36, has worked for her current employer, a consulting firm, since 2010. In her position as a management consultant, she has occasion to work on assignments that require access to classified information. She was first granted access to classified information while sponsored by a previous employer in September 2008. She has since maintained security clearance eligibility. Applicant completed her most recent security clearance application in January 2017 to obtain a higher level of access. On the application, she disclosed marijuana use from May 2002 to December 2005 and then again from October 2010 to September 2015, while holding a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is the basis for the SOR. (Tr. 21, 51; GE 1-2.) Applicant used marijuana while in college from 2002 to 2005. She testified that she first used marijuana when it was passed to her at a party and that she continued to use the drug in similar social settings until she graduated. In her 2008 security clearance application and at hearing, Applicant admitted that she used marijuana eight times while in college and that she stopped using to improve her chances of getting a federal job or a job that required a security clearance. (Tr. 33-35, 55-56; GE 2.) Applicant abstained from the drug for five years. In 2010, she claims that she accidentally consumed the drug at a friend\u2019s party. After this incident of accidental ingestion, she admits to resuming marijuana use in social settings. ",

Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nActing under under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as \namended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal \nconduct guidelines on December 14, 2018. DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and \nrecommended that the case be submitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) administrative judge for a determination whether to deny her security \nclearance.  \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, \nconvened on June 12, 2019, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, without \nobjection. Applicant objected to the admission of a summarized subject interview written \nby a background investigator from the Office of Personnel Management, on the grounds \nthat the document was not properly authenticated under Additional Procedural \nGuidance \u00b6 E3.1.20. I sustained the objection and the document is appended to the \nrecord as GE 3 for identification purposes only. I admitted Applicant\u2019s exhibits A through \nM, without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, as did two character witnesses. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 25, 2019.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 36, has worked for her current employer, a consulting firm, since 2010. \nIn her position as a management consultant, she has occasion to work on assignments \nthat require access to classified information. She was first granted access to classified \ninformation while sponsored by a previous employer in September 2008. She has since \nmaintained security clearance eligibility. Applicant completed her most recent security \nclearance application in January 2017 to obtain a higher level of access. On the \napplication, she disclosed marijuana use from May 2002 to December 2005 and then \nagain from October 2010 to September 2015, while holding a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use is the basis for the SOR. (Tr. 21, 51; GE 1-2.) \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana while in college from 2002 to 2005. She testified that \nshe first used marijuana when it was passed to her at a party and that she continued to \nuse the drug in similar social settings until she graduated. In her 2008 security \nclearance application and at hearing, Applicant admitted that she used marijuana eight \ntimes while in college and that she stopped using to improve her chances of getting a \nfederal job or a job that required a security clearance. (Tr. 33-35, 55-56; GE 2.) \n \nApplicant abstained from the drug for five years. In 2010, she claims that she \naccidentally consumed the drug at a friend\u2019s party. After this incident of accidental \ningestion, she admits to resuming marijuana use in social settings. She also used the \ndrug while on vacation in the Netherlands in 2011. She claims to have stopped using \nthe drug in 2015. It is unclear from the record how many times between 2010 and 2015 \nApplicant used the drug. On her January 2017 security clearance application, Applicant \ndisclosed that she, \u201c\u2026 rarely use[d], (maybe once or twice a year, if at all), estimating \n10 to 15 times within the last 10 years.\u201d Applicant admits that her drug use between \n2010 and 2015 occurred while she had a security clearance and that she worked on \nprojects that required access to classified information during that time. Between 2010 \nand 2015, Applicant experienced professional growth with increased responsibilities, \nincluding two promotions and supervisory duties. To her knowledge, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer does not have a policy prohibiting drug use or a drug-testing program. She \nalso claims she was unaware of her duty to report illegal drug use to her facility security \nofficer. (Tr. 35-42, 48-49, 59, 61, 77-78; GE 1.) \n \n \nApplicant claims that marijuana use is no longer consistent with her lifestyle. She \nis serious about her career, which is evident through her positive performance \n\n \n3 \n \nevaluations and awards. She is active in her employer\u2019s community efforts and \nparticipates in several volunteer activities on her personal time. Applicant claims that \nshe has withdrawn from the friend groups with whom she used marijuana. At hearing, \nshe presented several character letters in addition to the testimony of two witnesses. All \nattest to her drug-free lifestyle and overall good character. Applicant submitted a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from future drug use. She has also been in contact with \nher employer\u2019s security office about the existence of a drug-testing program in the event \nshe is granted a conditional clearance. (Tr. 29-32, 43-46, 53-54, 78-102; AE A-F, I-M.) \n \n \nIn January 2019, in preparation of the hearing, Applicant submitted to a voluntary \nsubstance abuse evaluation. The evaluator, a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), \nspecializing in substance abuse and addictions counseling, interviewed Applicant, \nperformed a drug assessment-screening test, reviewed the SOR, and the AG. The \nLCSW did not review the Applicant\u2019s security clearance applications. During the \ninterview, Applicant told the LCSW that she only used marijuana on three occasions \nbetween 2002 and 2005, not eight as disclosed on her 2008 security clearance \napplication. According to the evaluation report, Applicant described her use as reluctant, \nonly succumbing to the insistence  and pressure of her peers. Applicant only described \nthree instances of marijuana use between 2010 and 2015, two of which were \naccidental. The LCSW opined that Applicant was remorseful about her conduct and \ndiagnosed her with \u201cNo Use Disorder,\u201d and determined that no treatment was \nwarranted.  (AE G-H.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she did not appreciate the prohibition \nagainst marijuana use while having a security clearance. According to Applicant, other \nindividuals in her friend group between 2010 and 2015, led her to believe that marijuana \nuse while holding a security clearance was not a \u201cbig deal\u201d and would likely be \nadmonished by a \u201cfinger wag.\u201d  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness, because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (See, AG \u00b6 24.) Applicant admits \nto using marijuana at least eight times between 2002 and 2005. She also admits to \nusing marijuana between 2010 and 2015 after being granted a security clearance in \nSeptember 2008. Drug involvement and substance misuse disqualifying conditions \u00b6 \n25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d and \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access \nto classified information\u2026,\u201d apply.  \n \nThe favorable information in the record including: Applicant\u2019s lifestyle changes in \nsupport of abstinence, her favorable work performance history, and positive character \nreferences, does not mitigate the drug involvement concern. Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use \nis not mitigated by the passage of time and continues to reflect negatively on her \nongoing security worthiness. Her drug use did not occur under unusual circumstances, \nand was more than a youthful indiscretion that occurred during college. Applicant\u2019s use \nof marijuana after becoming a working professional was intentional and recreational. \nFurthermore, her use of illegal drugs while having a security clearance shows a lapse in \n\n \n5 \n \njudgment that cannot be considered minor. She acted in disregard of federal law and of \nthe voluntary fiduciary relationship she entered into with the government when she \nbecame a clearance holder. Although she has stated she will not use the drug in the \nfuture, she has demonstrated a lack of credibility that gives her promise little weight.  \n \nApplicant lied about her history of drug use during her substance abuse \nevaluation. The evaluation report offers a summarization and characterization of \nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use that contradicts with  Applicant\u2019s statements to the \ngovernment during this adjudication.  The nature of the inconsistent statements are not \nthe result of a faulty memory, but a purposeful effort to characterize her drug use as \nreluctant and accidental. In this case, Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements are even \nmore troubling because the government did not compel the evaluation or the production \nof the resulting report. Applicant lied in a setting completely of her own making. The only \nreasonable explanation for her doing so is to ensure she received the desired diagnosis \nand prognosis. None of the drug involvement and substance misuse mitigating \nconditions apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug use is also cross-alleged under the personal conduct guideline. \nApplicant\u2019s  history of use of illegal drug  when considered with the false statements she \nmade during her voluntary substance abuse evaluation supports a negative whole-\nperson assessment as described in AG \u00b6 16(c). Applicant\u2019s conduct revealed \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, reliability, lack of candor, and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,  and  other characteristics indicating \nthat she may not properly safeguard classified information. None of the personal \nconduct mitigating conditions apply.   \n \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s current \nsecurity worthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but \nrather are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in light of that \nperson's past conduct and present circumstances. (Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528-29 (1988.) The evidence supports a negative whole-person assessment \nindicating that Applicant lacks the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of \nthose granted access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and  \nSubstance Misuse:   \n \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nAGAINST APPPLICANT \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings (Continued) \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n________________________ \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Since \nthen, he has largely abstained from drinking. Through successful completion of alcohol \ncounseling, and positive lifestyle changes, he has shown that his alcohol issues are in the \npast and unlikely to recur. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his \nalcohol-related conduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \n Statement of the Case \nOn November 24, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). On March 5, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.   \n\n2 \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 20, 2019, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. He admitted all of the SOR allegations. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) On \nJune 5, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On June 6, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of Hearing, setting the hearing for June \n27, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled.\n During the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit (GE) 1 \nthrough 3 into evidence, Applicant offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A; there were no \nobjections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. I held the record open \nuntil July 29, 2019, in the event either party wanted to submit additional documentation. \nApplicant submitted AE B on July, 8, 2019, which I admitted into evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 11, 2019, and the record \nwas closed on July 29, 2019.\nFindings of Fact \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  Applicant is 52 years old. In March 1990, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. \nApplicant received serious injuries from a parachute malfunction, and he received an \nhonorable discharge in November 1993 for medical reasons. He earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 2013. He has never been married and he does not have any children. In \nOctober 2014, he was employed by a DOD contractor as a customer service \nrepresentative serving veterans. (Tr. 12-15; GE 1; AE A) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant was arrested in March 2008 for driving under the influence \n(DUI). His driver\u2019s license was suspended, he was placed on one year of probation, and \nrequired to attend an alcohol education course.  \nApplicant started drinking alcohol as a teenager. In 1993, his drinking \nescalated after he sustained the injuries in the U.S. Army. He also used alcohol \nas a coping mechanism for his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). His choice of \nalcohol is beer and bourbon. At the time of his first alcohol-related arrest in 2008, \nApplicant was drinking excessively on the weekends only. He had been at a friend\u2019s \nhouse drinking, and on his way home he was pulled over by the police. His breathalyzer \nregistered .11%. Applicant admitted that his drinking pattern did not change much after \nhis probation ended, and he eventually started drinking during the week after he left \nwork. He admitted that over time his alcohol increased to daily use. (Tr. 16- 22, 40-41; \nGE 1; GE 2) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant was arrested in November 2015, and charged with \nDUI. Applicant admitted drinking alcohol to excess. He was about 40 miles away from \nhome on a Saturday night, and he was involved in a single car accident while driving \nhome. The police arrived and he refused to take a breathalyzer test. He pled guilty to \nthe DUI charge and he lost his driver\u2019s license for three months. He was ordered to \nattend an alcohol education course. Initially, Applicant changed his drinking pattern and \ndid not go out on the weekends, but over time, he found that he was drinking again on a \ndaily basis. (Tr. 23-27; GE 1; GE 2; GE 3)\n\n3 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) Applicant was arrested in June 2017, and charged with DUI. He was \nsentenced to two weeks in jail, his driver\u2019s license was suspended, and he was required \nto install an interlock device in his vehicle for 18 months. Applicant was ordered to attend \nalcohol counseling on a weekly basis for one year. Prior to this 2017 arrest, Applicant ate \ndinner and had a few drinks on his way home from work. His one-way travel time from his \nhouse to his job is an hour-and-a-half drive. The American Legion is about half-way \nbetween the job site and his home. He was pulled over by the police for veering over the \nmarked line, and he refused to take a breathalyzer test. The DUI charge was considered \na second offense, and he was required to serve 14 days in jail. Applicant stated that his \ntwo-week jail sentence caused him to hit \u201crock bottom.\u201d He realized that he could no \nlonger drink alcohol at his current rate. After the 18-month interlock device period had \nexpired, Applicant requested to keep the device in his vehicle. He later received a letter \nfrom the state advising him that he needed to return the interlock device, which was \nremoved in December 2018. (Tr. 27-31; GE 1; GE 2; GE 3) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) Applicant received alcohol treatment at a counseling facility from July \n2017 to \u201cpresent\u201d (August 2018), for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Use Disorder \n(mild). According to the counselor, Applicant responded well to treatment and maintained \ntotal abstinence while enrolled in the program, which was not a requirement. As a result \nof his progress and meeting all treatment goals, Applicant was released from the program \nearly. (Tr. 31-35; GE 1; GE 2; AE B) \nSince the fall of 2017, Applicant reported that he has consumed alcohol less than \nsix times total, and always in a social setting. He no longer drinks and drives. He no longer \nfeels an urge to drink alcohol. He stated that if he thought alcohol was becoming a \nproblem for him, he would immediately report to his alcohol counselor or the Veterans \nAdministration (VA) chaplain. Since 1993, Applicant also received treatment from the VA \nfor PTSD and pain management. He does not take any habit forming prescription \nmedications, and his medical issues are controlled with the medication. (Tr. 34-39) \nApplicant\u2019s program manager submitted a letter of recommendation. He stated that \nApplicant is efficient, detailed oriented, and was chosen over his peers to provide training \nto new customer service representatives. He is a valued employee, and the program \nmanager recommended he be granted a security clearance in order that Applicant can \ncontinue to serve our military veterans with his outstanding customer service. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n\n4 \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d  \n\n5 \nAG \u00b6 22 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol\nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption  of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol\nuse disorder; and\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social\nworker) of alcohol use disorder.\nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), and 22(d). Appellant was \narrested for three offenses involving excessive alcohol consumption from 2008 to 2017, \nand he has three alcohol-related driving convictions. In 2017, he was diagnosed with \nalcohol-use disorder (mild), with no recommendation that he abstain from using alcohol \nduring treatment.  \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\njudgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol\nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;\n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has\nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory\nprogress in a treatment program; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along\nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established\npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations.\nApplicant presented information supporting his positive duty performance. His \nprogram manager recommended the issuance of his security clearance. Applicant \nsuccessfully completed an alcohol-related rehabilitation program. He paid his fines; his \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndriver\u2019s license has been reinstated; and he completed his probation. He requested to \nkeep the interlock device on his vehicle after he successfully completed the 18-month \ncourt-ordered requirement, but the state did not concur. He takes his job responsibilities \nseriously, and he is motivated not to engage in future irresponsible and illegal conduct. \nHis program manager\u2019s support is an indication he is trustworthy and reliable. He has \ntaken responsible action in changing his lifestyle, and strictly uses alcohol on a limited \nbasis. Future alcohol-related problems are unlikely to occur and do not cast doubt on \nAppellant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Guideline G security concerns \nare mitigated.   \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred three alcohol-related offenses between 2008 and 2017. Since \nthen, however, he has largely abstained from drinking. He does not drink to intoxication, \nand he does not drive after drinking. Through successful completion of alcohol counseling \nand positive lifestyle changes, he has shown that his alcohol issues are in the past and \nunlikely to recur. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n      FOR APPLICANT \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n      For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                \n            \n \n \n \n \nPamela C.
