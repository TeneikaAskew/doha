Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 8, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines G (Alcohol Consumption) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG).  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 25, 2010, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. His answer also stated that if certain items \u201ccan be verified by \nforwarding me the details for verification a hearing would not be required.\u201d After \nreceiving copies of the documents the Government planned to introduce into evidence, \nJune 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant changed his request and elected to have the case decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel exercised the Government\u2019s right to \nrequest a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum \nis marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The case was assigned to me on May 11, 2010. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 18, 2010, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on June 9, 2010. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June \n17, 2010.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nEvidence \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 14, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough C, which were admitted without objection.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice that \u201cgenerally \npersons hold[ing] a security clearance are obligated to self-report.\u201d He stated it was \nrequired under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). I \nheld the record open until June 18, 2010, for Department Counsel to submit a written \nrequest for administrative notice with a copy of the appropriate provision of the \nNISPOM. Applicant would have seven days after he received Department Counsel\u2019s \nsubmission to file any objections. Department Counsel did not submit anything by the \ndeadline. On June 21, 2010, he orally informed me, that he was not submitting anything. \nAbsent a written request with supporting documentation, Department Counsel\u2019s request \nfor administrative notice is denied. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \nOn my own motion and without objection from either party, I amended the SOR \nby adding an allegation under Guideline E, as follows: \n \n2.i. In a statement provided to an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement on November 7, 2008, you intentionally provided false \ninformation when you stated that you \u201cstopped drinking completely after \nthe second DUI.\u201d  \n \nApplicant admitted to the amended allegation. I offered Applicant a continuance and the \nopportunity to submit documentary evidence after the hearing. He declined both options \nand elected to proceed.1   \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 50-52, 61-62. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is seeking to \nretain his security clearance that he has held since the 1990s. He served in the U.S. \nNavy from 1979 until he was honorably discharged as a seaman apprentice (E-2) in \n1985. He has a Bachelor of Science degree. He married in 1983. He has three children, \nages 30, 22, and 20.2 \n \n \nApplicant used illegal drugs before and during his time in the Navy. He tested \npositive on at least one drug test and he was punished under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ). He stated that he has not used illegal drugs since 1985. \nApplicant submitted a Personnel Security Questionnaire in October 1985. He \nintentionally failed to list his illegal drug use and his punishment under the UCMJ. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance was denied in 1987 because of his falsification of the \nPersonnel Security Questionnaire.3  \n \n \nIn October 2001, Applicant was driving home from a competition that his \ndaughter was involved in, and he stopped and bought beer. He was drinking the beer as \nhe was driving home. He stopped to relieve himself when a police officer saw him. He \nwas arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and driving \nwith a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08% or more. His BAC was reported at \n.12%. He pled nolo contendere and was found guilty of the second count. The DUI \ncount was dismissed. He was sentenced to three days in jail less two days credit for \ntime served; $390 fine plus penalties, restitution, and fees; summary probation for 36 \nmonths; and ordered to complete a three-month alcohol program. Applicant was \npermitted to serve one day in the morgue in lieu of jail. Applicant completed the terms of \nhis probation.4 \n \n \nApplicant reported his DUI arrest to his company\u2019s security officer. He submitted \na security clearance application (SF 86) in January 2002. He reported his 2001 DUI, his \nmilitary adjudications, and the denial of his security clearance in 1987.5  \n \n \nApplicant and his daughter had an argument in September 2005. He left the \nhouse and bought beer, which he drank. He also purchased a 32-ounce cup of Diet \nCoke and a bottle of Jack Daniels. He mixed some of the Jack Daniels into the Diet \nCoke and drank that. He then was driving on the freeway at a high speed when he hit \nthe back of a trailer being pulled by a truck. The driver of the truck was able to get the \ntruck under control, but it went into the dirt divider and almost overturned. There was \nsignificant damage to the trailer, personal watercraft on the trailer, and the truck. \nApplicant did not have insurance at the time. He continued to drive and exited the \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 24, 60-61, 75; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 12. \n \n3 Tr. at 23-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 14. \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 5-7, 12, 14. \n \n5 Tr. at 63; GE 2. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nfreeway, but he was followed by several cars. When he stopped, one of the other \ndrivers pulled up next to him and told him that she was calling the police and he needed \nto return to the scene of the accident. He left, returned to the freeway, going the \nopposite way, and threw the bag with the Jack Daniels out the window. Another car \ncontinued to follow him until he left the freeway and stopped. The police arrived a short \ntime later. Applicant had a \u201cblackout\u201d and does not remember everything that occurred.6 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI; driving with a BAC of .08% or \nmore; hit and run; and reckless driving. His BAC was tested at .22%. In April 2006, he \npled nolo contendere and was found guilty of driving with a BAC of .08% or more and \nreckless driving. The remaining charges were dismissed. He was sentenced to ten days \nin jail less eight days credit for time served; $500 fine plus penalties and fees; $5,155 \nrestitution; summary probation for 60 months; ordered to complete a 30-month multiple \noffender alcohol program; and 120 hours of community service. The remaining counts \nwere dismissed. He completed \u201c18 months of 30 months\u201d of his multiple offender \nalcohol program.7 \n \n \nApplicant did not report his DUI/hit and run arrest to his company\u2019s security \nofficer. The company discovered the arrest in March 2006 when a third party informed \nthe company of Applicant\u2019s arrest. Applicant testified that he was unaware of any \nobligation to report the arrest.8  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nAugust 2006. Under the pertinent police record questions, he listed that he had a court-\nmartial for marijuana, but incorrectly listed that it occurred in 1993. He listed his 2001 \narrest for DUI, but listed that it occurred in 2002. He listed his 2005 arrest. He wrote the \noffense was \u201cDUI\u201d and the action taken was \u201cFine/Jail/Class.\u201d He did not specifically list \nthat he was also charged with hit and run. He denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86 by \nfailing to list that he was also charged with hit and run.9 After considering all the \nevidence, I find that Applicant did not intentionally falsify this SF 86. \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed on several occasions about his arrest and alcohol \nconsumption. He provided inconsistent information about his drinking. At one point he \ndenied having blackouts, which is inconsistent with his admission that he had a blackout \nduring his 2005 arrest.10 \n \n \nApplicant provided a signed statement to an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management in November 2008. He wrote in the statement that he had a \n                                                          \n6 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 8, 12, 14. \n \n7 Tr. at 22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 8-10, 12, 14; AE A, B. \n \n8 Tr. at 63-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 11. \n \n9 Tr. at 32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3. \n \n10 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 12-14. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nblackout during the 2005 arrest and did not remember all the details. He wrote: \u201cI \nstopped drinking completely after my second DUI. My future intent is to not drink and I \nhave no desire to drink now.\u201d Those statements were incorrect because Applicant \ncontinued to drink alcohol after the second DUI. He testified that his longest period \nwithout a drink during that period was three weeks to a month.11 I find that Applicant \nintentionally provided false information in this statement.  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed at least once in June 2009 by a different OPM \ninvestigator than the investigator who took the 2008 written statement. He continued to \nstate that he had remained sober.12  \n \n \nApplicant prepared a five-page statement on about June 24, 2009. The \nstatement was to be given to the OPM investigator to correct some of his \nmisrepresentations about his alcohol use. He wrote: \n \nIt is with deep sadness that I must acknowledge that I still drink alcohol on \noccasion. This deep sadness is because I did lie to the previous investigators \nand planned on lying to Agent [C]. . . . I have no deep sadness that I enjoy an \noccasional beer. This statement has been written as an omission of the fact that I \nstill drink alcohol on an occasional basis only.13 \n \nHe wrote that he started drinking casually in September 2007. He further wrote: \n \nSince that time my consumption has been predominantly on weekends, \nnever do I drink during the week. It should be understood the \u201cweekend\u201d \ndrinking does not occur every weekend, nor do I always drink just beer, on \noccasion I will have one/two drinks of hard alcohol, this var[ies] so it is \ndifficult to be specific as to type. As for beer, I enjoy the taste of Budweiser \nlight. \n \n*                         *                          * \n \nI am guilty of lying to the previous investigators and lying to Agent [C] \nconcerning my consumption of alcohol. My reasoning or rational[e] was \nthe constant probing concerning quantities, specific dates, specific people, \nand even emotional state. The probing for details caused me to ramble; in \nso doing I forgot what detail was missing or what I needed to mention. Let \nthis statement of omission and my desire to be truthful with the federal \ngovernment be the last time I need to explain my liking the taste of beer.14 \n \n                                                          \n11 Tr. at 45-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 12. \n \n12 GE 13. \n \n13 Id. \n \n14 Id. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator on July 7, 2009, and provided \na sworn statement. He did not give the investigator the above statement. Instead, he \nsigned a new statement which once again contained intentionally false information \nabout his alcohol use.15 He wrote: \n \nI don\u2019t know why I gave different answers creating inconsistencies in my \ntestimonies. The truth is I drank alcohol from age 14 or 15 up until \napproximately 1987. I stopped consuming alcohol in 1987 up until 1997. I \nwas prompted by my wife to stop drinking for ten years. My six year old \ndaughter at the time was programmed to get her father a beer. I started \ndrinking again in 1997 up until my Oct 01 DUI. I was drinking beer casually \nbut I cannot quantify the amount I consumed or the frequency in which it \nwas consumed. I do not want to contradict myself again by providing a \nnumerical amount. I maintained sobriety until my second DUI in Sep 05. \nAs stated in previous testimonies, I have no intentions of future alcohol \nuse. I have not consumed alcohol since my second DUI in Sep 05, \nalthough I have been tempted.16 \n \nAfter he signed the above false statement, Applicant gave the investigator the statement \nhe wrote in June 2009. His testimony about his current alcohol use is consistent with the \nJune 2009 statement.17 I did not find Applicant to be a credible witness and I question \nthe truth of his testimony and the above statement. \n \n \nApplicant submitted several letters attesting to his job performance, character, \nintegrity, and ethics. The authors recommend him for a security clearance.18   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n                                                          \n15 Tr. at 52-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 13, 14. \n \n16 GE 14. \n \n17 Tr. at 38-40, 45-46, 52-59; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE . \n \n18 AE C. \n\n \n7 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for Alcohol Consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21, as follows:   \n     \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n\n \n8 \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \nApplicant has two alcohol-related convictions. He admitted to excessive drinking \nincluding blackouts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c) are applicable.  \n \nThree Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest was in 2005. He has completed several \ncourt-ordered alcohol programs. He continues to drink alcohol, but indicated that he no \nlonger drinks and drives and he only drinks in moderation. There is no favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker. \nBased upon Applicant\u2019s extensive history of substance abuse and failure to be truthful \nabout his alcohol use, there is insufficient evidence for a finding that Applicant has his \nalcohol use under control. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n9 \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified a Personnel Security Questionnaire in 1985. He \nintentionally provided false information about his alcohol use to background \ninvestigators in 2008 and 2009. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) are applicable. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that Applicant was denied a security clearance in 1987 \nbecause of the falsification of his Personnel Security Questionnaire. The Personal \nConduct concerns raised by the falsification of his Personnel Security Questionnaire are \nalready alleged. SOR \u00b6 2.d does not allege distinctive conduct by Applicant. It alleges \nthe action of the Government in response to Personal Conduct already alleged. SOR \u00b6 \n2.d is concluded for Applicant. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges that Applicant failed to report his 2005 arrest to the \nappropriate personnel at his place of employment. There was no evidence submitted \nthat Applicant was required to report his arrest. SOR \u00b6 2.e is concluded for Applicant.  \n \n \nApplicant did not intentionally falsify his 2006 Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions. SOR \u00b6 2.f is concluded for Applicant. \n \n \nThere is insufficient information to raise the factual basis for the conduct alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 2.g. That allegation is concluded for Applicant. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \n\n \n10 \n \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant falsified a Personnel Security Questionnaire in 1985. He was denied a \nsecurity clearance in 1987 because of that falsification. Some years later, he reapplied, \nrevealed his drug and criminal history, and was granted a clearance. That falsification \nhappened 25 years ago and was mitigated when he obtained a security clearance after \nrevealing the truth. While he was eventually granted a clearance, the denial clearly put \nApplicant on notice that he was required to be completely truthful about all security \nmatters. He was not. He was untruthful in at least two different interviews. He submitted \na correction on the same day as his last false statement. That correction provides some \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a). However, I have lingering doubts about the complete \nveracity of the corrected statement and his testimony.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n11 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant has a long history of substance abuse and dishonesty. He falsified a \nPersonnel Security Questionnaire in 1985 after his discharge from the Navy. He was \naware of the importance of complete candor in security matters because he was denied \na security clearance in 1987 based upon the falsification of the questionnaire. He has \ntwo alcohol-related convictions. The second occurred not long after he completed \nprobation for the first offense. It appears he is still on probation. He was untruthful on \nseveral occasions about his current alcohol consumption. I did not find him to be a \ncredible witness and have doubts as to the truthfulness of his testimony. I have \nsignificant unresolved concerns about his honesty, judgment, trustworthiness, and \nalcohol issues. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.h-2.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 13, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On July 9, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nOn appeal, Applicant raises the following issue: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is 62 years old and had\na lengthy career as a police officer.  Applicant now works as a security guard.  The SOR indicates\nthat Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in April 2005 to protect his house from\nforeclosure, and the petition was dismissed in May 2005.  In October 2005, Applicant filed a Chapter\n7 bankruptcy petition and was discharged from all dischargeable debts except for a student loan for\nhis daughter.  The SOR lists eight debts, of which Applicant admits two and denies six.  Some of\nthe debts in the SOR were discharged in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and some Applicant paid after\nhe received the SOR.  Applicant attributes some of his financial difficulties to a divorce, to medical\nexpenses related to hair transplant surgery, and to a student loan for his daughter\u2019s college education.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant presents some information not contained in the record below.\nThe Board cannot consider this new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\nApplicant objects to the Judge\u2019s characterization of some of the evidence he submitted.  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial\nevidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the\nrecord.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01105 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2008).\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not acknowledge or give proper consideration to his\ncharacter references.  Applicant refers in part to the persons he named as references on his security\nclearance application and others he assumes an investigator would have interviewed.  An applicant\nhas the burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security clearance decision.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  The Judge had access only to the materials before him.  If Applicant wished to have\ncharacter references from the persons he identified on his application, he had a responsibility to\nprovide written references from those persons.  See ISCR Case No. 03-08073 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct.\n25, 2005).  Applicant does cite one character reference letter he submitted which he argues that the\nJudge did not acknowledge.  Applicant is correct in this regard.  Generally, there is a rebuttable\npresumption that a Judge has considered all the evidence in the record, even if he does not mention\neach item of evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08134 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2005).   In this\ncase, the Judge stated that Applicant did not submit any character evidence about his job\nperformance.  Decision at 4.  Applicant did submit a letter from a supervisor at his place of\nemployment in his response to the File of Relevant Material (FORM).  The Judge therefore\ncommitted error.  However, in light of the record as a whole, the error is harmless, since it is unlikely\n\nthat the Judge would have reached a different decision based on that one reference letter.\n \nApplicant argues that he has mitigated any security concerns that might exist under Guideline\nF and that the Judge either did not consider or did not give adequate weight to his evidence of\nmitigation.  Applicant admitted some of the SOR allegations against him.  The burden then shifted\nto Applicant to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised by those allegations.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  The Judge concluded that Applicant did not present evidence sufficient to overcome the\nsecurity concerns raised.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-\nperson factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts\nof a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make\na favorable security clearance determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2008). \nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against his financial history and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and factors.  Decision at 5-6.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  Id.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,  2007).  The Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,  \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States, Inc. v. State\nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Dep\u2019t of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).

On August 13, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nsecurity concerns under financial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006.\nJuly 9, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on December 12, 2008. He\nrequested a decision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the\nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support\nof the allegations of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on March 3, 2009. Applicant\nreceived the FORM on March 19, 2009. His response was received by DOHA on April\n5, 2009. The case file was assigned to me on May 29, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains 10 allegations under the financial considerations guideline.\nApplicant admitted subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.g., and 1.j. He denied subparagraphs\n1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.h., and 1.i. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the\nfollowing factual findings. \nApplicant is 62 years old, divorced, with three grown children. He received a\nBachelors Degree in Public Safety in December 1979. He has been employed as a\nsecurity guard by a defense contractor since 2006. His previous jobs between 2001 and\n2006 were in gun sales or security. From 1972 to 2001, Applicant was a police officer. \nReasons for Applicant\u2019s financial problems, included in his response to the\nFORM, but missing from his answer to the SOR, were mistakes made during his\nmarriage. He stated:\nThe financial pitfalls I have encountered during the course of my marriage,\nthe most severe of which was the loss of my house due to delinquent\nmortgage payments, funds for which, as well as other household\nexpenses, I had regularly provided to my ex-wife. My eventual divorce was\nbased on the sole premise \u201cmismanagement of marital assets\u201d by my wife\n(response to FORM). \nIn an interview with an OPM investigator in July 2007, Applicant stated that the\nmajority of his debt arose from medical bills associated with his hair transplant surgery,\nand his daughter\u2019s student loan (Item 12). \nThe delinquent accounts shall be addressed in the order they appear in the SOR.\n3 SOR 1.a. Applicant filed a Chapter 13 petition in April 2005 to keep his house,\na common reason for protecting real estate. The petition was dismissed in May 2005\nbefore confirmation. Applicant contends a title company fraudulently convinced him to\nfile this petition. He lost his house and filed a complaint with the state banking\ncommission. No additional information was provided to substantiate his fraud claim. I\nfind against Applicant. \n3 SOR 1.b. Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in October 2005. He\nlisted approximately $19,700 in assets and $47,368 in liabilities. He was discharged\nfrom all dischargeable debts, except for the student loan, in February 2006. I find\n\n3\nagainst Applicant based on the record that shows a dismissed Chapter 13 petition, then\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, with continuing financial difficulties. \n3 SOR 1.c. $4,685, credit card. The debt became a judgment in October 2002. It\nwas discharged in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2006 (SOR 1.b.). This\naccount is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n3 SOR 1.d. $1,917, telephone debt that was placed for collection in 2002.\nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated March 23, 2009, reflects that the account was included in\nhis Chapter 7 petition (SOR 1.b.). This subparagraph is found for Applicant. \n3 SOR 1.e. $944, medical services. Two government credit reports list this\naccount. Applicant denies this account because he filed all claims with one provider. As\nApplicant indicated in his response to the FORM, the medical account does not appear\nin his March 2009, credit report. There is a collection account in Applicant\u2019s March 2009\ncredit report that has similar information to the credit reports in Items 10 and 11 (SOR\n1.e.), but the information in the reports is insufficient to find this account is the same.\nAlso, the information in his credit report that reflects similarities to the medical account\nalleged is reported as included in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. This account is found in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \n3 SOR 1.f. $63, telephone. Applicant was notified by the collection agency on\nMarch 27, 2009, his account was paid in full (response to FORM). This account is\nresolved for Applicant.\n3 SOR 1.g. $51,586, student loan of Applicant\u2019s daughter. From May 2005 to at\nleast July 2007 (July 2007 interview, Item 12), Applicant was living with his daughter.\nAccording to his response to the FORM, his claim is that he assumed incorrectly the\nloan was discharged in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. On February 11, 2009, Applicant was\ninformed by letter from the student assistance organization that his $290 payment would\nbe deposited on February 20, 2009. Applicant provided his checking account ledger\nshowing that on February 20, 2009, his account was debited in the amount of $290.\nThere is no documentation to substantiate the loan was renegotiated or more than one\nmonthly payment was made, as Applicant contends. I find against Applicant under SOR\n1.g.\n3 SOR 1.h., $1,615, state tax lien. On March 25, 2009, Applicant paid $1,932 in\nfull satisfaction of the lien. This allegation is found for Applicant. \n3 SOR 1.i., $3,606, utility. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied this\naccount, but did not provide an explanation as to why he denied the account. In his\nresponse to the FORM, he indicated he called the utility and was given an account\nnumber that is not the same as in the correspondence provided in the government\ncredit reports or in his March 2009, credit report. While the account numbers for the\naccount are not the same, there are striking similarities: (1) all three credit reports label\nthe account \u2018Public Service;\u2019 (2) and, all three reports quote the same figure of $3,606.\n\n4\nApplicant claims he called the collection agency identified by the original creditor.\nApplicant did not explain why he did not call the collection agency referenced in the\nSOR. See Item 10. This account is found against Applicant.\n3 SOR 1.j. $174, debt to Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney in October 2005.\nApplicant paid the debt by check on December 9, 2008 (response to FORM). The\naccount is found in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nCharacter Evidence\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant identified measures taken to regain good\ncredit. He has no credit card debt. He will be paying off his car loan in May 2009. His\ndaughter\u2019s student loan was renegotiated, and is being paid as agreed. He has a\nsavings and a checking account with more than $5000 in each. Applicant indicated that\nhe has worked diligently to improve his finances over the last several years. \nApplicant also included a number of copies of checks to show he has been at his\ncurrent address for almost two years. The checks, i.e., the check for March 1, 2009,\nprovide a post office box number, and a city, but not an address. According to the\nFebruary 11, 2009, letter from the student loan association (SOR 1.g.) to Applicant, his\npost office box and the city are different. Though the checks are labeled for rent, and\ninclude a month and year the rent applies to, there is no indication the checks have\nbeen processed. Significantly, a third address, different from the other addresses, and\nwith no post office box, appears on the March 27, 2009, collection agency letter (SOR\n1.f.) to Applicant (response to the FORM). \nApplicant presented no character evidence about his job performance and/or\nstanding in the community. He provided no evidence of financial counseling. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to the potential rather than actual risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n\u00b618. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nThe government has established their case under the financial considerations\n(FC) guideline. When the SOR was published in August 2008, the government\u2019s\ndocumentation showed that Applicant had more than $59,000 in debt he was unable to\nrepay. FC disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\napplies. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 petition in April 2005 that was dismissed in May\n2005. While filing a Chapter 13 petition is a legitimate procedure to protect real property,\nApplicant provided no evidence in explanation of how he was defrauded by the title\n\n6\ncompany into filing the petition. Applicant then filed a Chapter 7 petition in October\n2005, and had more than $47,300 in debt discharged in February 2006. Though he\nblamed his former wife as the reason for his Chapter 7 filing, he told the investigator in\nJuly 2007 that his medical bills for surgery and his daughter\u2019s student loan constituted\nthe majority of his debt. Applicant has had continuing financial delinquencies as\ndemonstrated by SOR 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., and 1.j. FC DC \u00b619.c. (a history not meeting\nfinancial obligations) also applies. \nApplicant indicated he has worked hard to put his finances back in order. He\nstates he has no credit card debt and his car will be paid off in May 2009. This favorable\nevidence must be weighed against the passage of 2 \u00bd years since February 2006\n(Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 discharge)  showing no action taken to resolve his debt. Even\nafter his interview in July 2007, when he was placed on notice by the government that\nhis debts continued to be a concern, Applicant took no action until December 2008,\nwhen he paid his bankruptcy attorney\u2019s debt (SOR 1.j.), when he made a $290 payment\non the student loan (SOR 1.g.) in February 2009, and, when he paid the state tax lien\n(SOR 1.h.) and the telephone account (SOR 1.f.) in March 2009. The fact that these\ndebts were paid after Applicant received the SOR in August or September 2008,\ncombined with the lack of independent character evidence, reduces the limited\nmitigation he receives under FC mitigating condition (MC) \u00b620.a. (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nand good judgment).\nThe mitigation Applicant receives under FC MC \u00b620.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances) because of his divorce in April 2005 is\nsubstantially decreased by the 2 \u00bd year period (February 2006 to December 2008)\nshowing Applicant did nothing to address the listed debts. \nFC MC \u00b620.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\ndoes not apply as Applicant provided no evidence of financial counseling. Even though\nsix of eight debts have been paid off, the remaining delinquent accounts under SOR\n1.g. and 1.i., amounting to more than $53,000, preclude a finding that Applicant has his\nfinancial problems under control. \nThe weight afforded to Applicant under FC MC \u00b620.d. (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) is reduced by\nthe fact Applicant did not begin to repay the listed creditors until December 2008, about\nthree months after he received the SOR. Applicant\u2019s unexplained Chapter 13 petition,\nhis Chapter 7 discharge of more than $47,300 in delinquent debt in 2006, followed by\ncontinuing financial problems, and the absence of character evidence and financial\ncounseling, has not been mitigated by the FC mitigating conditions. \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the FC guideline. The case still must be\nweighed within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: \nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant was about 57 years old in 2005 when he filed the Chapter 13 petition\nand the Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge petition. He claims he incorrectly assumed the\nstudent loan would be discharged in his Chapter 7 petition. I am unable to accept his\nclaim. Even though Applicant may not have known in October 2005 that student loans\ncould not be discharged in bankruptcy, he was living with his daughter when he filed the\nChapter 7 petition. He was still living with her at the time of his government interview in\nJuly 2007. It seems reasonable that either Applicant or his daughter would have been\nnotified that the student loan was not discharged. The only reason Applicant may not\nhave been notified was because the bankruptcy court did not have the correct address.\nBased on the multiple addresses Applicant presented to his creditors during the security\ninvestigation, it is entirely likely the court did not have the correct address. His claim he\nwas not notified is substantially discredited by the different addresses he provided\nduring the course of the security investigation and this adjudication. Even after being\nplaced on notice in July 2007 that his delinquent debts were a governmental concern,\nApplicant did not take action until December 2008, after he received the SOR.\nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient to\ncarry his ultimate burden of persuasion under the FC guideline.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e. \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 13, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On July 9, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n2\nOn appeal, Applicant raises the following issue: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is 62 years old and had\na lengthy career as a police officer.  Applicant now works as a security guard.  The SOR indicates\nthat Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in April 2005 to protect his house from\nforeclosure, and the petition was dismissed in May 2005.  In October 2005, Applicant filed a Chapter\n7 bankruptcy petition and was discharged from all dischargeable debts except for a student loan for\nhis daughter.  The SOR lists eight debts, of which Applicant admits two and denies six.  Some of\nthe debts in the SOR were discharged in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and some Applicant paid after\nhe received the SOR.  Applicant attributes some of his financial difficulties to a divorce, to medical\nexpenses related to hair transplant surgery, and to a student loan for his daughter\u2019s college education.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant presents some information not contained in the record below.\nThe Board cannot consider this new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\nApplicant objects to the Judge\u2019s characterization of some of the evidence he submitted.  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial\nevidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the\nrecord.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01105 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2008).\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not acknowledge or give proper consideration to his\ncharacter references.  Applicant refers in part to the persons he named as references on his security\nclearance application and others he assumes an investigator would have interviewed.  An applicant\nhas the burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security clearance decision.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  The Judge had access only to the materials before him.  If Applicant wished to have\ncharacter references from the persons he identified on his application, he had a responsibility to\nprovide written references from those persons.  See ISCR Case No. 03-08073 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct.\n25, 2005).  Applicant does cite one character reference letter he submitted which he argues that the\nJudge did not acknowledge.  Applicant is correct in this regard.  Generally, there is a rebuttable\npresumption that a Judge has considered all the evidence in the record, even if he does not mention\neach item of evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08134 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2005).   In this\ncase, the Judge stated that Applicant did not submit any character evidence about his job\nperformance.  Decision at 4.  Applicant did submit a letter from a supervisor at his place of\nemployment in his response to the File of Relevant Material (FORM).  The Judge therefore\n\n3\ncommitted error.  However, in light of the record as a whole, the error is harmless, since it is unlikely\nthat the Judge would have reached a different decision based on that one reference letter.\n \nApplicant argues that he has mitigated any security concerns that might exist under Guideline\nF and that the Judge either did not consider or did not give adequate weight to his evidence of\nmitigation.  Applicant admitted some of the SOR allegations against him.  The burden then shifted\nto Applicant to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised by those allegations.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  The Judge concluded that Applicant did not present evidence sufficient to overcome the\nsecurity concerns raised.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-\nperson factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts\nof a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make\na favorable security clearance determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2008). \nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against his financial history and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and factors.  Decision at 5-6.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  Id.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,  2007).  The Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,  \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

During the same month, the investigator prepared a four page report based on that interview. DOHA sent interrogatories to applicant in February 2008, which he answered in March 2008. In addition to interrogatories requesting specific information about his drug use, one interrogatory specifically asked applicant if the four page report \u201creflect[s] accurately the information that you provided to the authorized investigator for the Department of Defense on the day you were interviewed.\u201d Applicant responded \u201cyes\u201d to this interrogatory. The four page report, interrogatories, and applicant\u2019s answers to the interrogatories, are all part of Exhibit 5. As reflected in the September 2007 four page report, applicant told the investigator he (1) smoked marijuana and/or hashish from 1967 to the present, (2) uses 1 about one joint two to three times per month, (3) uses these drugs at home and at parties to relax from the pressures of the job, (4) feels \u201chigh\u201d when he uses them, and (5) intends to use the same amount of these drugs in the future.

Marine, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 18, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn May 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline H. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 10, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 25, 2008. Applicant filed a\nresponse to the FORM on November 14, 2008. The case was assigned to me on\nDecember 12, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\nSome of his drug use occurred while he was holding a security clearance.\n1\n Interrogatory 5. In April 2008, applicant prepared a self-styled \u201camendment,\u201d presumably to his\n2\ninterrogatory responses,  in which he stated: \u201cThis added amendment is to clear up any questions that I\ndidn\u2019t finish correctly. On the question of ever used drugs: The statement I wrote was based on my Son.\nThe last time that I remember smoking was on 1 January 2008. On the question of ever purchased, was\nby my son and that date is on the paper work.\u201d At the end of the \u201camendment,\u201d he reiterated that he\nsmokes \u201cmaybe once every two or three months.\u201d\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 54 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM/DOD investigator in September 2007.\nDuring the same month, the investigator prepared a four page report based on that\ninterview. DOHA sent interrogatories to applicant in February 2008, which he answered\nin March 2008. In addition to interrogatories requesting specific information about his\ndrug use, one interrogatory specifically asked applicant if the four page report \u201creflect[s]\naccurately the information that you provided to the authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense on the day you were interviewed.\u201d Applicant responded \u201cyes\u201d to\nthis interrogatory. The four page report, interrogatories, and applicant\u2019s answers to the\ninterrogatories, are all part of Exhibit 5.\nAs reflected in the September 2007 four page report, applicant told the\ninvestigator he (1) smoked marijuana and/or hashish from 1967 to the present,  (2) uses\n1\nabout one joint two to three times per month, (3) uses these drugs at home and at\nparties to relax from the pressures of the job, (4) feels \u201chigh\u201d when he uses them, and\n(5) intends to use the same amount of these drugs in the future. Applicant confirmed\nsome of this information in response to Interrogatory 1, where he stated he had used\nmarijuana/hashish two/three times a month, last used one or both of these drugs in\nFebruary 2008, and has not decided to stop using illegal substances.\nIn the 1970s, applicant was charged with Possession of Marijuana after a police\nofficer searched applicant and found a \u201cjoint\u201d on him. The case was dismissed because\nthe search was ruled illegal.\nIn either the late 1980s or early 1990s, applicant was charged in a foreign\ncountry with Possession of Marijuana. He was convicted, fined, and placed on\nprobation.\nIn SOR Paragraph 1.c., the Government alleges applicant purchased marijuana\non multiple occasions. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated, \u201cI DENY IT. I have\nnever purchased marijuana, or hash. Some one else does this. This is so that I don\u2019t\nknow who and where?\u201d His denial conflicts with his response to one of the\naforementioned interrogatories, where he stated he had purchased marijuana and\nhashish in February 2008.  \n2\nIn SOR Paragraph 1.d., the Government alleges applicant intends to continue\nusing marijuana. This allegation is certainly consistent with what applicant told the\ninvestigator in September 2007, and what he stated in response to the interrogatories in\n\n3\nMarch 2008. However, in his response to the allegation he stated, \u201cI DENY IT. This is a\nspecific question. Right now, NO to the question.\u201d\nIn response to the FORM, applicant provided a long statement in which he\nstated, among other things, \u201cLet me try to explain myself here. I really did not know what\nI need to do during this time frame, but I do know this much. I have not drunk or smoked\nany drugs for over 5 years now, must be getting older and that I have no interest in it.\u201d\nThis denial of any drug use during the last five years contradicts every other statement\nhe has provided on this issue.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\n\n 50 U.S.C. 435c.(b).\n3\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set forth in Paragraph 24 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nUse of an illegal drug . . . can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nParagraph 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 25.a., \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying. Under\nParagraph \n25.c., \n\u201cillegal \ndrug \npossession, \nincluding \ncultivation, \nprocessing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution . . .\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph\n25.h., an \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s use and\npurchase of marijuana and hashish, and his March 2008 statement that he has no\ncurrent plans to stop using marijuana, raise these three disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 26 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I considered each of them and conclude none apply.\nIn addition to the AG, current law specifically prohibits the granting of a security\nclearance to an \u201cunlawful user of a controlled substance.\u201d  For purposes of this\n3\nprohibition, an \u201cunlawful user of a controlled substance\u201d is a person who uses a\ncontrolled substance and has lost the power of self-control with reference to the use of\nthe controlled substance, or is a person who is a current user of the controlled\nsubstance in a manner other than as prescribed by a licensed physician. Because the\nevidence does not support a finding that applicant has lost his self-control with respect\nto his drug use, or that he has used marijuana or hashish since February 2008, I\nconclude he does not meet the definition of \u201can unlawful user of a controlled substance.\u201d\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2.c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\n\n5\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a middle aged man who\nhas used marijuana and hashish for many years. As recently as March 2008, he\nindicated he will continue to use these drugs.  Although he provided a carefully worded\ndenial of an intent to continue using marijuana and hashish in response to the SOR, this\ndenial is not credible in light of his many decades of drug use and the numerous\ninconsistent statements he provided regarding his drug use. Based on the foregoing, I\nconclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from Guideline H.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Mendez, Jr, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 29 October 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline B.  Applicant answered the SOR on 21 November 2008, requesting a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 17 February 2009, and I convened a hearing\non 18 March 2009. DOHA received the transcript 25 March 2009. \nMay 29, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 38-year-old program director\nemployed by a U.S. defense contractor since March 1999. He has not previously held a\nclearance.\nApplicant was born in Peru in May 1970. His father was a career officer in the\nPeruvian army who served 35 years before retiring in January 1995, with the rank of\ngeneral in the corps of engineers. Applicant\u2019s mother is a life-long homemaker.\nApplicant has three brothers: one is a student, the second an English teacher, the third\na travel guide. Neither his mother nor his brothers has ever had an official connection\nwith the Peruvian government. His father has no further contact with the military. None\nof Applicant\u2019s family members live near Peru\u2019s border with Colombia.\nIn 1986, when Applicant was age 16, he came to the U.S. with his family. His\nfather was assigned for two years as the Peruvian attache to the Organization of\nAmerican States (OAS). In 1998, Applicant\u2019s family returned to Peru. Applicant,\nhowever, remained in the U.S. to go to college. He never returned to Peru to live.\nApplicant received his undergraduate degree in computer science from an\nAmerican university in 1992. In March 1995, he married a native-born U.S. citizen. They\nhave two children, born in the U.S. in 1998 and 2001. Applicant eventually returned to\nschool and received a graduate degree in software engineering in 2000. He became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in November 2004, overcoming several years of foul-ups\nregarding his citizenship.\nApplicant estimates his net worth in the U.S. at $150,000\u2013200,000. He and his\nwife own their home and two timeshare condominiums. He has no property or financial\ninterests in Peru. He believes he renounced his Peruvian citizenship as part of his\nnaturalization oath, and thinks of himself as only a U.S. citizen. He has lived in the U.S.\nfor 23 years. His career and family are here. He does not believe he has divided\nloyalties, and takes his security responsibilities seriously.\nSince 2002, Applicant has traveled to Peru to visit his family six times: in October\n2002, March 2003, December 2005, March 2006, June 2007, and October 2008. When\nhe is in Peru, he sometimes sees his uncle, who is a career diplomat with the Peruvian\ngovernment. These contacts are infrequent, and Applicant has no contact with his uncle\nwhen Applicant is in the U.S. \nApplicant\u2019s character reference has known him as supervisor, coworker, and\nfriend since 1995. He testified that Applicant is absolutely loyal to the U.S., has a great\nwork ethic, and high work ethics. He considers Applicant very honest and loyal, and\nrecommends him for his clearance. He was aware of the administrative hurdles\nApplicant had encountered and overcome in his quest to become a U.S. citizen. For\nexample, Applicant\u2019s application was apparently shifted several times to different\nnaturalization offices around the country, with the result that he had to keep tracking his\n\n3\napplication down and provide whatever new information was requested by the new\noffice.\nPeru is a developing country and the most populous country in South America. It\nenjoys strong and cooperative relations with the U.S., particularly regarding counter-\nnarcotics. Although Peru has a history of military rule, democratic rule has governed the\ncountry since 1980\u2014albeit with significant human rights problems between 1990 and\n2000, when the government was conducting counter-insurgency operations against\nlocal terrorist groups. While terrorist groups continue to operate along Peru\u2019s border\nwith Columbia, current human rights practices are generally respectful of democratic\ninstitutions. Peru is not a known collector of U.S. information.\nPeru recognizes dual citizenship. While there is a formal procedure for\nrenunciation of citizenship, acquiring another citizenship does not terminate Peruvian\ncitizenship. Peru confers citizenship by decent to any child born abroad of a Peruvian\nparent. \nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the nine whole person factors listed in\nRAG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed where a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy\nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Further, each\nguideline requires evaluation in the context of the whole person. Considering the SOR\nallegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant adjudicative guideline here is\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\n4\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or\n3\nother foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.4\nIn this case, the argument for disqualification under Guideline B is not\npersuasive. Considering first the foreign country involved, Peru and the U.S. enjoy\nexcellent foreign relations, particularly regarding counter-narcotics operations. Peru is\nnot known to target protected U.S. information, nor is it known to target U.S. citizens to\nobtain protected information. In this case, the potential heightened risk concerns the\nterrorist organizations operating along Peru\u2019s border with Colombia. Here the potential\nrisk of terrorist activity is undercut by the fact that none of Applicant\u2019s family live in the\nborder areas near Colombia that are most at risk.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s situation in relation to the Peruvian government, the\ngovernment produced little evidence that there was any risk, much less a heightened\nrisk, of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of\nApplicant\u2019s family contacts in Peru. Applicant\u2019s travel to Peru has no independent\nsecurity significance given that Peru is not known to be targeting U.S. citizens for\ninformation. Further, the security significance of travel under most circumstances is\ndemonstrating an applicant\u2019s affection for family members, which his trips corroborate\nand which Applicant does not dispute. But, except for his uncle, none of his family\nmembers is connected to the Peruvian government nor otherwise situated to be\nexploited for information gathering. There is nothing in the circumstances of their being\nin Peru, or in Applicant\u2019s contacts with them, to heighten the risk that he could be\nimpelled to provide protected information to Peru. \n\n5\nBy comparison, Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S. are overwhelming. He has resided\nhere for 23 years. He has been a citizen for almost five, overcoming what appears to\nhave been a bureaucratic wild goose chase concerning his application for citizenship.\nHis wife and children are U.S. born citizens. His financial interests in the U.S.\u2014net\nworth of $150,000\u2013200,000 and real estate ownership\u2014coupled with the absence of\nany property or financial interests in Peru, demonstrate the unlikelihood that he could be\ninfluenced to act against U.S. interests. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nA whole person analysis of the facts in this case requires no different result.\nStrictly speaking, this case involves no misconduct subject to the kind of analysis\ncontemplated by RAG \u00b6 2 (a), but revolves around Applicant\u2019s status in relation to his\nfamily members in Peru. The salient consideration under the whole person analysis is\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. As indicated above, the\npotential for such influence in Applicant\u2019s case is low.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Michael Gyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (PTA) on\nNovember 4, 2007. On April 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nfinancial considerations (Guideline F), and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action\nwas taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted her notarized answer to the SOR on September 19, 2008.1\nShe requested a decision in her case without a hearing. DOHA mailed a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM, information provided to an applicant to support the\nMarch 11, 2009\n\n The question requires information about whether the applicant has filed for bankruptcy, or been the subject\n2\nof a tax lien or legal judgment in the last 7 years. \n2\nallegations of the SOR) to Applicant on December 30, 2008. She received the FORM on\nJanuary 6, 2009. Her response to the form, which was received on February 4, 2009,\nhas been admitted in evidence. I was assigned the case on February 20, 2009. Having\nconsidered the entire record, Applicant\u2019s request for employment in a public trust\nposition is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges financial considerations because Applicant owes 13 delinquent\ndebts and two judgments. She admitted all the financial allegations which total\n$29,869.00. The SOR also alleges personal conduct based on a Questionnaire for a\nPublic Trust Position (PTA) signed by Applicant on November 7, 2007 where she\ndisclosed a judgment in response to question 22.a.,  but answered \u201cNo\u201d to question\n2\n22.b., requiring information about debts at least 180 days delinquent. Applicant admitted\nshe omitted the financial information but denied her omission was deliberate. \nApplicant is 50 years old, and has been married since February 1986. She has\nthree children. She is employed by a defense contractor as a CA 3. She seeks a\nsensitive position.\nFinancial Considerations\nIn an attachment to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she explained she has been\nin very little criminal trouble in her life. She also stated she wanted to pay off as many of\nher overdue debts as possible when she gets her income tax refund. She first\nencountered money problems when she lost her job at a pottery in 2001. Her current\nemployment is the first 40-hour job she was employed in the pottery job in 2001. She\nbelieves she is a hard worker. \nIn her interview with an agent from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\non January 22, 2008, Applicant provided more detail about her financial troubles. Once\nshe lost her pottery job in 2001, her husband did not earn sufficient money to take care\nof the expenses of three children, rent and automobile. Her mobile home (SOR 1.c,\n$9,531.00) mortgage became delinquent in May 2002. In an effort to reduce costs,\nApplicant\u2019s mother, who was suffering from cancer, and her sister moved in with\nApplicant and her son. Applicant\u2019s son tried but could not maintain the mortgage\npayments because of a job-related injury requiring surgery. His surgery left him\nunemployed for a year. The mobile home was repossessed and transferred to a\ncollection agency. The amount listed in SOR 1.o. ($9,682.00) represents the second\nloan on Applicant\u2019s mobile home. This loan became delinquent in November 2007.\nApplicant claims she continued to pay the mortgage for years even after the mobile\nhome was repossessed. No additional information was provided. \n\n3\nDuring the security investigation, Applicant indicated in her response to the\nFORM she did not know the SOR 1.a. creditor. In her response to the FORM, she\nstated she knew about the debt, but did not know how the debt was created. She\nprovided no additional information on the current status of the debt. \nThe judgment listed in SOR 1.e. resulted from a loan Applicant obtained to help\nher son. Her son could not maintain the payments, and a judgment was entered against\nApplicant in June 2004. Applicant claims her son is negotiating a settlement with the\ncreditor. No additional evidence was provided to show the status of those negotiations,\nand Applicant\u2019s participation in the negotiations. \nApplicant explained that certain of the admitted allegations were for medical bills.\nThose allegations include SOR 1.b., 1.d., 1.f., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., and 1.n. She\ndetermined that SOR 1.h. and 1.i., were fees connected to her defaulted second\nmortgage listed in SOR 1.o. All allegations listed under paragraph 1 of the SOR are\nfound against Applicant. \nIn her responses to interrogatories from government (Item 5), dated June 24,\n2008, Applicant provided updated information on her financial condition. She explained\nthat she and her husband were working 40 hour weeks; her husband was earning\n$13.00 an hour while her earnings were approximately $10.00 an hour. Applicant\nrealized she should start paying the smaller delinquent debts first. She provided proof of\nresolving one debt on May 12, 2008 for $546.00. This creditor is listed 21 times in her\ncredit report (item 7). \nPersonal Conduct\nOn November 4, 2007, Applicant certified and signed a PTA. In response to\nquestion 22.b. of the form requiring information about debts at least 180 days\ndelinquent, Applicant replied \u201cNo.\u201d In her answer to SOR 2.a, Applicant stated, \u201cI\nadmit[.] But I did not do it intent[ionally], I was so nervous I didn\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\nOn the other hand, in her response to the FORM, Applicant initially indicated she did not\nknow about the debts listed in the SOR. In her modified explanation, she indicated that\nbecause the accounts were charged off, they were not active. In addition, Applicant\nexplained that because none of the creditors contacted her to settle the overdue debts,\nshe did not consider them current. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent explanations for the omitted\nthe information warrant a finding she deliberately omitted financial information from her\nPTA. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant indicated the people she works with will all agree she is a real\nprofessional who has compiled a good attendance record on the job. However, she\nprovided no evidence, e.g., character statements or letters/certificates of recognition in\nsupport of her claim. There is no indication that Applicant has had financial counseling\nor evidence she has contacted any of the listed creditors or collection agencies, as she\n\n4\nclaimed, since the debts became delinquent or as she promised she would do in June\n2008, when she provided information about the past due accounts and her earnings. \nPolicies\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of\nDefense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASDC3I), entered\ninto a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) which gave DOHA the responsibility to\nprovide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel working on unclassified\nInformation Systems Positions as defined in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated January 1987.\nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the\nsecurity guidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . .\nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive\nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d The Regulation sets\nforth personnel security guidelines, disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline. In determining whether the applicant qualifies a sensitive position under the\ntrustworthiness standard, the applicant must be provided the due process procedures\ncontained in DoD Directive 5220.6.\nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of each security\nguideline, the general factors of the whole person concept should be applied in deciding\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant an applicant eligibility\nfor assignment to sensitive duties. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. These guidelines are\nflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines\nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The\nadministrative judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense\ndecision. According to the AG, the entire process is a careful, thorough evaluation of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\n\n5\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship is not restricted\nto normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-the-clock responsibility\nbetween an applicant and the federal government. The government reposes a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nA person who seeks or occupies a public trust position has a duty to show she or\nhe can be trusted to handle the responsibilities of the job. The applicant also has a duty\nto demonstrate she can be trusted to properly handle various responsibilities in their\npersonal lives. Depending on the issues involved in public-trust-position cases, a person\nmust demonstrate she obeys the law. She also must show she does not use drugs or\nabuse alcohol. Or, an applicant must show they can be trusted to be candid and\nforthright during all phases of a security investigation. Finally, an applicant must\ndemonstrate she can be trusted to handle her finances in a responsible manner. This\nmeans when an applicant determines that bills are falling delinquent, she takes the\nrequisite action to make her debts current or take the appropriate action to regain\ncontrol of her finances.  \n\n6\nThe SOR shows that Applicant owes 13 debts and two judgments to eight\ncreditors, and has done nothing to regain control over these debts. FC disqualifying\ncondition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) applies due to\nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay the listed debts. FC DC 19.c. (a history not meeting financial\nobligations) applies as the credit report shows that the debts fell delinquent between\n2002 (SOR 1.c.) and November 2007 (SOR 1.o).\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition\n(MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment); FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances); FC MC 20.c. (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control); and, FC MC 20.d. (the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nFC MC 20.a. does not apply. Several of the debts are dated, but SOR 1.o.\nbecame delinquent within the last two years. Even though Applicant paid an unlisted\ncreditor in May 2008, there are 13 debts and two judgments remaining to be addressed.\nThe absence of action in paying off these debts casts continuing doubt on Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nFC MC 20.b. is applicable to the circumstances of this case because Applicant\nlost her job in 2001, and was unable to find a 40-hour job until she began working for\nher current employer in November 2007. In June 2008, Applicant explained dramatic\nimprovement in her financial stability because she and her husband had 40-hour jobs.\nMore important, she claimed that she recognized the need to pay off her delinquent\naccounts, and by providing documented evidence verifying she settled with an unlisted\ncreditor in May 2008. Based on the totality of the evidence, Applicant\u2019s repayment of\nonly one creditor between 2002 and February 2009 (when Applicant submitted her\nresponse to the FORM), rules out the favorable application of the second prong of FC\nMC 20.b. (and the individual acted reasonably under the responsibly under the\ncircumstances), thereby diluting the overall weight that is assigned to the mitigating\ncondition.  \nFC MC 20.c. does not apply. Applicant has had no financial counseling, and still\nowes all of the listed debts. The same conclusion is made regarding FC MC 20.d. as\npayment of one of the unlisted creditors from the SOR is insufficient to demonstrate a\ngood-faith effort to satisfy overdue creditors, or to conclude Applicant is really serious\nabout paying off her remaining creditors. In sum, the mitigating evidence under FC MC\n20.b. and 20.d. does not overcome the negative evidence presented under FC DC 19.a.\nand 19.c.\n\n7\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answers to the financial question 22.b. (debts at least 180 days\ndelinquent) of her PTA in November 2007 was a deliberate falsification of relevant facts\nas defined by PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission, falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire used to determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness).  Applicant had to be thinking about the debts when she supplied the\n\u201cNo\u201d answer, because she referred to them as being charged off and/or not current\nwhen she filled out the PTA in November 2007. In addition, when she answered the\nSOR in September 2008, she initially explained that nervousness caused her to answer\nin the manner she did. Yet, in her response to the FORM, while she claims she was\nunaware of the debts, she does not even mention the nervousness explanation she\ndescribed in her answer. Considering Applicant\u2019s knowledge of the debts when she\nfilled out the PTA, and her unsuccessful efforts to rationalize her deliberate behavior,\nthe PC guideline is resolved against her. \nI have carefully considered the following mitigating conditions to determine\nwhether Applicant\u2019s intentional omissions are mitigated: PC MC 17.a. (the individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts); PC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment); and, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur). \nPC MC 17. a. does not apply because Applicant never made any prompt, good-\nfaith attempt to correct the false information, and still does not believe she falsified the\nPTA. PC MC 17.c. does not apply as Applicant attempted to conceal thirteen debts\nwhen she certified and signed her PTA in November 2007. Finally, PC MC 17.d. (the\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur) is not applicable as Applicant does not accept she\nknowingly provided false information on a security form. She has not presented any\nindependent, mitigating character evidence to confidently conclude her dishonest\n\n8\nconduct is unlikely to recur. In sum, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation does not meet her\nresponsibility of demonstrating her security suitability under the PC guideline.  \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the FI guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG \u00b6 2(a)\nApplicant owes two judgments and 13 creditors more than $29,800.00 in debt\nthat dates to 2002. While she repaid a creditor in May 2008, she has done nothing to\nresolve the other debts, even after she declared in June 2008 she was going to contact\nthe creditors. An applicant who encounters financial problems should take appropriate\nsteps to remedy those problems. Persuasive evidence of sound financial habits is to\ncontact the creditor(s) and negotiate some kind of agreement for repayment. If the\ncreditor does not desire to negotiate, an applicant should seek some professional help\nsuch as a consumer credit counseling service for financial advice on how to establish a\ndebt consolidation plan. However, the applicant, not the creditor, has the responsibility\nto initiate and seek a solution to their financial difficulties. A plan to handle debts, united\nwith a track record that puts the plan in motion, i.e., payments under a debt\nconsolidation plan, goes a long way to demonstrate the applicant is truly committed to\neliminating past due debts. Given Applicant\u2019s payment of only one unlisted creditors\nwhile accumulating more than 13 debts and two judgments between 2002 and May\n2008, when she paid the unlisted creditor, coupled with the lack of financial counseling,\nand her deliberate omission of financial information from her November 2007 PTA,\nApplicant has not established she is eligible for a public trust position. Accordingly, both\nguidelines are found against Applicant. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1.o.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that as of May 2009, Applicant owed delinquent state taxes of $45,982 (SOR 1.a, 1.bb), $10,920 in past due medical debt (SOR 1.b-1.i, 1.dd-1.ee), and $117,999 in delinquent consumer credit debt (SOR 1.j-1.aa, 1.cc). Applicant admitted the debts, but indicated that she was repaying the state tax debt in SOR 1.bb at $500 every paycheck. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following factual findings. Applicant is a 64-year-old analyst, who has worked for her present employer since August 2007. She previously worked for this employer from June 1988 to April 2004, with the exception of a few months between 2001 and 2002. (Ex. 1.) Applicant left her full-time employment with the company after September 11, 2001, to volunteer at a local elementary school because she wanted to contribute to her community. (Ex. 4.) She had a home on which she was making monthly mortgage payments of $1,597. (Ex. 8.) Around February 2002, she resumed working for her current employer. By October 2003, she had little work to do, and in April 2004, she was laid off. (Tr. 35.) Applicant listed her house for sale, and she relied on savings to remain current in her living expenses and debt payments. (Ex. 4, 5) In November 2004, she decided to return to her native state Y to be near family. (Ex. 4.) In December 2004, she sold her home in state X at a profit of $98,000, and she moved to state Y.

Garcia, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nIn January 2010, Applicant filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, listing\n$126,461.44 in federal and state tax liabilities, $16,582.04 in delinquent medical debt,\nand $107,634.06 in unsecured consumer credit debt. While unemployment and illness\nled her to accrue much of the debt, she made some poor financial decisions that\ncontinue to cast doubt about her judgment. Eligibility for public trust position is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn August 21, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nto Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, that provided the basis for its preliminary\ndecision to deny her eligibility for a public trust position, and to refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense Regulation\n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (January 1987) as amended; and the\nSeptember 30, 2010\n\n2\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September\n1, 2006.\nOn October 9, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on December 29, 2009, to conduct a hearing\nand to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant eligibility for a public trust position. I received the case file on January 11,\n2010, and on February 11, 2010, I scheduled a hearing for March 4, 2010.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Eight Government exhibits (Ex. 1-8) and\nseven Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-G) were admitted into evidence without objection, and\nApplicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 19, 2010. At\nApplicant\u2019s request, I held the record open until March 19, 2010, for her to update the\nstatus of her bankruptcy filing. On March 9, 2010, Applicant submitted a signed\nstatement summarizing information about her pending discharge. The document was\nadmitted without objection as Exhibit H.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that as of May\n2009, Applicant owed delinquent state taxes of $45,982 (SOR 1.a, 1.bb), $10,920 in\npast due medical debt (SOR 1.b-1.i, 1.dd-1.ee), and $117,999 in delinquent consumer\ncredit debt (SOR 1.j-1.aa, 1.cc). Applicant admitted the debts, but indicated that she\nwas repaying the state tax debt in SOR 1.bb at $500 every paycheck. After considering\nthe pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following factual findings.\nApplicant is a 64-year-old analyst, who has worked for her present employer\nsince August 2007. She previously worked for this employer from June 1988 to April\n2004, with the exception of a few months between 2001 and 2002. (Ex. 1.)\nApplicant left her full-time employment with the company after September 11,\n2001, to volunteer at a local elementary school because she wanted to contribute to her\ncommunity. (Ex. 4.) She had a home on which she was making monthly mortgage\npayments of $1,597. (Ex. 8.) Around February 2002, she resumed working for her\ncurrent employer. By October 2003, she had little work to do, and in April 2004, she was\nlaid off. (Tr. 35.) Applicant listed her house for sale, and she relied on savings to remain\ncurrent in her living expenses and debt payments. (Ex. 4, 5) In November 2004, she\ndecided to return to her native state Y to be near family. (Ex. 4.) In December 2004, she\nsold her home in state X at a profit of $98,000, and she moved to state Y. (Tr.  61.)\nIn January 2005, Applicant bought a home in her new locale, spending the\n$98,000 in equity from her previous residence, and taking out a $158,600 30-year\nconventional mortgage loan with repayment at $1,189 per month. (Ex. 6, 7; Tr. 61.)\nApplicant\u2019s only earned income over the next two years was from substitute teaching\nand a seasonal job in the retail sector. (Ex. 1; Tr. 36.) She was unable to find full-time\nemployment in software development. (Tr. 36.) Applicant relied heavily on consumer\n\nBased on a review of her credit reports (Ex. 6, 7, 8) and bankruptcy petition (Ex. D), it appears that\n1\nthree debts were duplicated in the SOR (SOR 1.k same debt as SOR 1.y, SOR 1.l same debt as SOR 1.w,\nand SOR 1.o same as SOR 1.x).\nApplicant testified that she \u201clost a bundle\u201d on the sale of her home. (Tr. 61.) Yet, in June 2009, she\n2\ntold DOHA that she had received $20,000 from the sale. (Ex. 4.)\nApplicant\u2019s wages for 2008 totaled $57,728. (Ex. D.)\n3\n3\ncredit cards after she had exhausted her retirement assets to cover her living expenses.\n(Ex. 6, 7, 8, D; Tr. 36, 60.)\nBetween May and July 2006, Applicant underwent diagnosis and treatment for\nbleeding, which she believes was caused by poisoning. (Tr. 43-45.) She incurred\nmedical expenses that were not covered by her insurance (Tr. 58.), including $10,920\n(SOR 1.b-1.i, 1.dd-1.ee) that went to collection between September 2006 and April\n2007. She also stopped paying on several credit card accounts in 2006, when she could\nno longer afford the payments. Then, in September 2006, state X filed a $11,246 tax\nlien against Applicant for delinquent taxes, apparently because of the capital gains on\nthe house she had sold in December 2004. (Ex. 6, D; Tr. 53.)\nBy August 2007, when Applicant regained full-time employment as a \u201cremotely-\nlocated employee\u201d with her present employer (Ex. 1, A.), her delinquent credit card\nbalances totaled around $98,000 (SOR 1.j-1.v, 1.z-1.aa, 1.cc).  (Ex. 6, 7, 8, D.) She had\n1\nalso not made any payments on the state tax debt. (Ex. 6, 7, 8.) On August 23, 2007,\nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P). She listed only\none delinquent debt; the mortgage loan on her home. (Ex. 1.)\nAs of September 2007, Applicant\u2019s mortgage was past due 150 days in the\namount of $5,946, and several consumer credit card accounts and medical debts were\nin collection. (Ex. 6.) Her house went into foreclosure shortly after she was hired, and\nfunds earmarked for bills went instead to attorneys to stop the foreclosure. (Ex. 2, Tr.\n65-66.) During an interview with a government investigator on October 24, 2007,\nApplicant discussed her financial problems, which she attributed to lack of full-time\nemployment and no medical insurance. She indicated that she was paying $1,700 per\nmonth to catch up her mortgage, and $300 per month on the debt in SOR 1.r. Applicant\nvolunteered that she had listed her home for sale at an asking price of $260,000. She\nanticipated receiving $100,000 from the sale, and expressed her intent to pay all of her\ndebts, if her house sold. (Ex. 4.)\nApplicant earned only $20,533 in 2007. (Ex. D.) In March 2008, the project that\noccupied Applicant\u2019s time was put on hold, and her work hours were reduced to only 24\nevery two weeks. Around June 2008, Applicant sold her home, receiving only $20,000\nout of the sale due to the decline in the real estate market.  (Ex. 2, 4, D; Tr. 61.) It is not\n2\nclear what she did with the funds. While her work hours had increased by July 2008,3\nApplicant\u2019s wages were being garnished by the IRS to recover unpaid taxes from when\nshe lived off her 401(k) assets. (Ex. D, H.) After consulting with an attorney (Ex. 3),\nApplicant notified DOHA in July 2008 that she intended to file for bankruptcy. (Ex. 2.)\n\nApplicant informed DOHA in July 2008 that her tax delinquency with state X was being repaid through\n4\nautomatic deduction. (Ex. 2.) She provided a statement of her earnings and deductions for the period\nNovember 2008 through May 2009  (Ex. E) showing that the IRS (not state X) had garnished $22,507.39 from\nher wages for back federal income taxes. (Tr. 32, 37-38, Ex. H.) The balances of her tax debts to the IRS and\nstate X were not available for review. She listed the initial balances on her bankruptcy petition (Ex. D.), and\nshe did not recognize the $41,457 federal tax debt included in her bankruptcy when asked about it at her\nhearing. W hen asked about her total debt to the IRS, Applicant responded, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d (Tr. 48.) As for\nthe state X tax lien of $34,736 in SOR 1.a, Applicant testified the balance must be due to interest and\npenalties. (Tr. 54.)\n4\nFrom mid-November 2008 through late May 2009, $22,507.39 was garnished\nfrom her pay by the IRS,  so she netted pay of only $5,466.04 (between $340.32 and\n4\n$344.24 every two weeks) for those six months. (Ex. E.) In May 2009, state X filed a\n$34,736 tax lien against her. (Ex. 8) In June 2009, Applicant told DOHA that she had\nbeen paying federal and state taxes \u201cevery two weeks since last year.\u201d (Ex. 3.) She\npresented no record of any payments in 2008 other than by IRS garnishment. \nAs of June 2009, Applicant\u2019s take-home pay was $340 every two weeks because\nof the IRS levy. She had paid her attorney a retainer of $1,866 to file for bankruptcy, but\na respiratory illness that summer delayed her filing. (Ex. D; Tr. 67.) On receipt of a\nsettlement offer from one of her creditors (not alleged in SOR), Applicant paid $32.36 to\nsettle a $107.85 balance in June 2009. (Ex. G.) Later that month, Applicant paid a\n$24.93 radiology debt owed since December 2008. (Ex. F.) In September 2009,\nApplicant entered into agreements to repay her federal tax debt at $1,000 per month,\nand her state X tax delinquency at $500 every two weeks. (Tr. 49, 54.)\nApplicant earned total wages of $65,912.51 for 2009. (Ex. D.) On January 26,\n2010, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, listing $126,461.44 in unsecured\npriority claims; IRS debts of $41,457.10 for tax year 2003 and $2,787.42 for tax year\n2006, an IRS levy of $70,970.92, and the $11,246 state tax lien. Of the $124,216.10 in\nunsecured nonpriority debt, $107,634.04 was non-medical consumer credit debt. It is\nunclear whether Applicant included the debt in SOR 1.aa on her petition, although all\nthe others are listed on her schedules. Applicant reported monthly expenses of $4,339,\nincluding monthly payments of $1,000 to the IRS and $1,124 to state X for delinquent\ntaxes. She reported average monthly income equal to her expenditure and no savings.\n(Ex. D.) Applicant listed assets of $4,401.04. On February 22, 2010, she completed\nonline instruction in personal financial management required for a bankruptcy\ndischarge. (Ex. C.) As of March 4, 2010, Applicant had not yet been granted a\ndischarge. On or before March 9, 2010, Applicant learned from her bankruptcy attorney\nthat the trustee had notified the court that she would be granted a discharge on May 3,\n2010, with no assets for distribution. (Ex. H.)\nApplicant does not have a good handle on how much she owes in back taxes. If\nher tax debts are not discharged, she plans to have her filings for tax years 2004\nthrough 2007 reviewed by someone with knowledge of tax matters. She intends to\ncontinue repaying her tax debts until then. (Tr. 49-57.) She has no discretionary income\n\n5\nafter paying her living expenses and her tax payments. (Tr. 63-64.) She has no savings\nand no credit cards. (Tr. 64.)\nApplicant demonstrated an excellent work ethic while employed in state X for her\npresent employer. She continued to display the same dependability and willingness to\ntake on new challenges, while working independently from state Y. Her supervisor\nconsiders her to be a valued employee. (Ex. A.)\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for .\n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead,\nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all\navailable reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are\nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\n\nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances\n5\nin which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered:\n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation,\nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated\nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive\nSection 6.3.\n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct.\n24, 2003)). I have considered the non-SOR misconduct for the five above purposes, and not for any other\npurpose.\n6\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Section 7\nof Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nAs of March 2010, Applicant was seeking a discharge in bankruptcy of\n$16,582.04 in delinquent medical debt, and $107,634.06 in unsecured past due\nconsumer credit debt, including some debts not in the SOR. Furthermore, a $21,473\ndelinquent credit card balance (SOR 1.r) appears to have been omitted from her\nbankruptcy. Included on her bankruptcy petition was a state X tax lien of $11,246, which\nwas filed against her in September 2006. Applicant may well owe a larger balance,\ngiven that a $34,736 state X tax lien was filed against her in May 2009. In addition, she\nacknowledges owing a sizeable federal tax delinquency that was not alleged in the\nSOR. She included in her bankruptcy federal tax debt totaling $44,244.52, but also an\nIRS levy of $70,970.92, that she has been repaying, initially through garnishment of her\nwages and since September 2009, under an agreement with the IRS.  Applicant\u2019s\n5\nrecord of serious financial delinquency implicates potentially disqualifying conditions AG\n\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\n\nSee 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a), which provides, in part, as follows:\n6\n(a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title does not\ndischarge an individual debtor from any debt-\n(1) for a tax or a customs duty-\n(A) of the kind and for the periods specified in section 507(a)(3) or 507(a)(8) of this\ntitle, whether or not a claim for such tax was filed or allowed;\n7\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably\napply in mitigation, even in the event of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. Her financial\nproblems are too extensive and too recent to favorably consider AG \u00b6 20(a). \nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies in part. Applicant was unemployed\nfrom April 2004 until August 2007, except for some substitute teaching and seasonal\nretail work. She had unexpected medical expenses during the summer of 2006. That\nsaid, one has to question the soundness of her financial judgment. Applicant apparently\nwithdrew her 401(k) assets without regard to the tax implications. She bought a home\nimmediately on relocating to state Y when she did not have a job that would provide the\nincome to cover the mortgage and living expenses. After she was rehired by her\nemployer in August 2007, she had to pay extra on her mortgage to avoid losing her\nhome to foreclosure, so she was not in a position financially to address her delinquent\ndebts. IRS garnishment of her wages left her with little to live on during the first half of\n2009, and it explains her nonpayment of other debts during that time. Illness played a\nlimited role in delaying her bankruptcy filing. But \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate the concerns\nabout Applicant\u2019s mishandling of her personal finances. She testified that she \u201clost her\nshirt\u201d when she sold her house in 2008, but there is evidence that she may have\nrealized $20,000 from the sale.\nDespite her payments on her tax debts on terms accepted by the IRS and state X\nsince September 2009, I cannot fully apply AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Repayment of her tax\ndebts commenced initially through involuntary garnishment, and while a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy discharge would relieve Applicant of much of her debt burden, she has no\nassets to distribute to her creditors. \nApplicant received credible assurances from her attorney of an expected\ndischarge of her bankruptcy in May 2010. A discharge would implicate AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as to the debts\ndischarged. Assuming Applicant no longer is legally responsible for the nonpriority\nunsecured consumer credit debt included in her Chapter 7 filing, there is no debt on\nApplicant\u2019s Schedule F that corresponds in amount to the $21,473 collection debt in\nSOR 1.r. Furthermore, the evidence before me is inconclusive on whether her tax debts\nwould be discharged. Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523, certain tax debts are not discharged.6\n\n(B) with respect to which a return, or equivalent report or notice, if required-\n(i) was not filed or given; or\n(ii) was filed or given after the date on which such return, report, or notice was last\ndue, under applicable law or under any extension, and after two years before the date of the\nfiling of the petition; or\n(C) with respect to which the debtor made a fraudulent return or willfully attempted\nin any manner to evade or defeat such tax;\n(14) incurred to pay a tax to the United States that would be nondischargeable pursuant to\nparagraph (1);\n(14A) incurred to pay a tax to a governmental unit, other than the United States, that would\nbe nondischargeable under paragraph (1).\nAs set forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7507(a)(8), some tax debts with priority are not dischargeable:\nThe following expenses and claims have priority in the following order:\n(8) Eighth, allowed unsecured claims of governmental units, only to the extent that such\nclaims are for-\n(A) a tax on or measured by income or gross receipts for a taxable year ending on or before\nthe date of the filing of the petition-\n(i) for which a return, if required, is last due, including extensions, after three years before the\ndate of the filing of the petition;\n(ii) assessed within 240 days before the date of the filing of the petition, exclusive of-\n(I) any time during which an offer of compromise with respect to that tax was pending or in\neffect during the 240-day period, plus 30 days; and\n(II) any time during which a stay of proceedings against collections was in effect in a prior\ncase under this title during that 240-day period, plus 90 days.\n(iii) other than a tax of a kind specified in section 523(a)(1)(B) or 523(a)(1)(C) of this title, not\nassessed before, but assessable, under applicable law or by agreement, after the\ncommencement of the case.\n8\nWith respect to a Chapter 7 discharge under section 727, taxes on or measured by\nincome for a taxable year ending on or before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy\npetition would not be subject to discharge, if the return for those taxes was last due,\nincluding extensions, within three years of the date of the bankruptcy filing.\nGovernment taxes on or measured by income, assessed at any time within 240 day\nbefore the bankruptcy petition date, are also not dischargeable. Applicant, who had \u201cno\nidea\u201d of the balances of her federal and state tax delinquencies, had reported on her\nbankruptcy two IRS debts from 2003 and 2006, and a state A tax lien from 2002. Her\ncredit reports instead show tax liens filed in September 2006 and in May 2009.\nApplicant\u2019s federal tax return for tax year 2006 would have been due within three years\nof her bankruptcy filing in January 2010. The May 2009 tax lien, about which Applicant\ncould only speculate, also raises questions about the extent and dischargeability of her\ntax obligations. Based on the evidence before me, I am unable to apply AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\n\nThe factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are:\n7\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n9\nAG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d is not satisfied by promises to \u201crevisit\u201d her tax liabilities with professional help if\nher tax debts are not discharged. She provided no evidence that invalidates the tax\nliens in SOR 1.a or 1.bb. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies in limited part, in that the debts in SOR\n1.w, 1.x, and 1.y are updated collection balances of the debts in SOR 1.k, 1.l, and 1.o\nand not additional debts.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a).  Applicant\u2019s finances were adversely affected by lengthy unemployment,\n7\nand at times by illness. But Applicant also mismanaged consumer credit extended to\nher. Even if a significant stress burden is alleviated through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nliquidation, I remain concerned about her financial situation. As of March 2010,\nApplicant had no discretionary income and no savings. More troubling, she displayed\nlittle knowledge about the current balances of her tax debts. She was still trying to \u201cget a\ngrip\u201d on her tax situation after paying over $2,000 per month toward her taxes for\nseveral months. (Tr. 54.) Applicant needs an income to meet her financial obligations,\nincluding the payments on any tax debts that survive her bankruptcy. That said, the\nissue before me is whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest for her to\nhold a position of trust. While she has demonstrated reliability and trustworthiness in her\nwork performance, it is not enough to overcome the doubts about whether she can be\ncounted on to make sound financial decisions going forward.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\nFavorable findings are warranted as to those balances that are updated collection balances of debts\n8\notherwise listed in the SOR.\n11\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nFor Applicant8\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aa:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.bb:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.cc:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.dd:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ee:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his \nfalsification of two public trust position applications and his long-term illegal use of \nmarijuana while in a position of trust. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III \nposition is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 13, 2000 and on September 26, 2007, Applicant submitted Public Trust \nPosition Applications (SF 85P). On April 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, detailing the basis for \nits preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for a public trust position, citing \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nNovember 25, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended \n(Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for a public trust position, and it recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether eligibility should be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn May 4, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 9, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 15, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on July 10, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 5, all of which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 10, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 16, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings \nof fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old software development engineer working for a defense \ncontractor. He attended college and received a Bachelor of Science (computer science) \ndegree in1992. He has never been married.  \n \nApplicant has been employed in the same position since August 1996, albeit \nunder different company names (Tr. 37). He submitted his first public trust position \napplication in September 2000, and he was granted a public trust position (automated \ndata processing (ADP-II) shortly thereafter. He has held that position continuously since \nthen.  \n \nApplicant has worked as a software development engineer during the last 16 \nyears. He testified that he is considered to be an above-average software developer \nand he has extensive specialized experience in his field. He is a leader and the \u201cgo-to \nguy\u201d in his company. Based on his references\u2019 statements, he is considered to be an \noutstanding employee, hard working, dedicated, responsible, and diligent. He has a \nreputation as a trustworthy and honest person. \n \nApplicant started to use marijuana illegally around 1990, when he was in his 20s \nand attending college (Tr. 38). He knew that his use of marijuana was illegal (Tr. 41). He \nused marijuana because it enhanced his music-listening experience and made him feel \nmellow (Tr. 39). He smoked marijuana every weekend, and went to class at least five \ntimes under the influence of marijuana (Tr. 41). Applicant continued to use marijuana \n\n \n3 \n \n \nillegally from the 1990s to October 2007. Since around 2000, he used marijuana illegally \nat least once every two or three months (Tr. 87). He also purchased marijuana for \npersonal consumption. \n \nIn his July 2000 public trust position application, Applicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d to \nquestion 16 (asking whether in the last seven years he had been arrested, charged \nwith, or convicted of any offenses). He listed a 1994 arrest for Driving Under the \nInfluence (DUI), but deliberately failed to disclose that he was arrested in June 1994, \nand charged with Controlled Dangerous Substance \u2013 Possession Marijuana and \nPossession Drug Paraphernalia With Intent to Use. He answered \u201cNo,\u201d to question 17, \nasking whether in the last year he had used any controlled substance (marijuana). He \ndeliberately failed to disclose he had illegally used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom 1990 to July 2000.  \n \nIn his September 2007 public trust position application, Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d \nto question 21, asking whether in the last year he had used any controlled substance \n(marijuana). He deliberately failed to disclose he had illegally used marijuana with \nvarying frequency from 1990 to September 2007. Applicant continued to use marijuana \nafter he submitted his 2007 application. \n \nIn December 2007, Applicant was confronted by a government investigator about \nhis failure to disclose his 1994 drug-related arrest. After he was confronted, Applicant \ndecided to be truthful and forthcoming about his illegal drug use and provided additional \ninformation concerning his drug-related behavior. Applicant admitted that he deliberately \nfalsified both public trust position applications because he was embarrassed and \nashamed of his drug use. He believed it would tarnish his professional reputation and \naffect his livelihood if it were known publicly that he was an illegal drug user (Tr. 45).  \n \nApplicant explained that when he took the government job in 2000, he knew the \nrules had changed and that he was required to comply with the law, and that his use of \nillegal drugs would negatively impact his ability to hold a public trust position. Knowing \nthe consequences, he elected to continue his drug-related behavior, he just \u201cdialed it \nback\u201d (Tr. 47-51). He also knew his employer had a policy against the use of illegal \ndrugs (Tr. 58). \n \nApplicant continues to associate with many of his drug-using friends, most of \nwhom he has known for over 20 years. He considers most of his marijuana using \nfriends his \u201cbrothers.\u201d He has no intention of disassociating himself from his long-time \nfriends regardless of the fact that some of them continue to use marijuana (Tr. 69).  \n \nApplicant believes he has an alcohol problem and that he drinks too much. He \ngoes out to party every weekend with the same long-time drug-using friends he has \nknow for the last 20 years. His friends frequently use marijuana when they go to parties. \nHowever, his friends are aware of his situation and they do not smoke marijuana in his \npresence (Tr. 84). They go to a different room or go outside the house to use the \nmarijuana. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his illegal drug-related behavior and for \nfalsifying both public trust position applications. He wants to continue working for the \ngovernment, and believes he has a lot to offer. He promised never to use illegal drugs \nagain, and stated his intent never to break the laws again (Tr. 63-65). He also submitted \na statement of intent to never use illegal drugs in the future with automatic revocation \nfor any violation (Tr. 17, AE 9). \n \nApplicant blames his employer for his falsification of both of his public trust \nposition applications. He alleged that his employer failed to provide him with adequate \nadvice about the adverse consequences he would face for not being truthful in his \napplications (Tr. 17, 89-90). \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The government\u2019s authority to restrict access to \nclassified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access \nto information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. See Id. at 527.  \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s controlling adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand common sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.   \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See \nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance \n[or access to sensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, \n2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security/trustworthiness concern \nstating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on his 2000 public trust position \napplication when he failed to disclose that in 1994, he was arrested and charged with \nillegal drug-related offenses. He also deliberately falsified material facts on both his \n2000 and 2007 public trust position applications when he failed to disclose that he used \nand purchased marijuana illegally from around 1990 to at least September 2007, while \nhe held a public trust position. Applicant continued to use marijuana after submitting his \n2007 application. \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions create trustworthiness concerns under two disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d and 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct or concealment of information \nabout one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, \nsuch as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.\u201d  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find none apply. Applicant \nfalsified both of his SF 85Ps. It was not until after he was confronted during the \ninterview process that he admitted his arrest and charges for illegal drug-related \nbehavior. He then provided truthful information concerning his long history of illegal drug \nabuse. His falsifications are serious offenses (felony), they are recent, and they cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s drug-\nrelated behavior increased his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern about drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight conditions related to drug involvement that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Three drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions raise a security concern and are disqualifying in this particular case: AG \u00b6 \n25(a): \u201cany drug abuse;\u201d1 AG \u00b6 25(c): \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia;\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g): \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security \nclearance.\u201d \n \nBetween 1990 and October 2007, Applicant illegally used, possessed, and \npurchased marijuana with varying frequency. While in college he used marijuana most \nweekends. More recently, he used marijuana illegally once every two to thee months. \nHis behavior triggers the applicability of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g).2 The other \ndisqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable.  \n \n1  AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n2  AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find none apply. Applicant\u2019s \nlong-term history of illegal use of marijuana is recent. His use of marijuana was part of \nApplicant\u2019s partying lifestyle with his long-time college friends. He continues to associate \nwith his marijuana-using friends. Applicant specifically ruled out the possibility of \ndisassociating himself from these friends. Thus, his questionable behavior is likely to \nrecur. Applicant does not understand what is required of him to have the ability to serve \nin a public trust position. \n \nApplicant receives credit for his two-year period of abstinence. He also receives \ncredit for his signed statement of intent not to use illegal drugs with automatic revocation \nof eligibility for any violation. Notwithstanding, considering the evidence as a whole, I \nfind the drug involvement concerns are not mitigated.  \n \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Cocaine and methamphetamine are Schedule II Controlled Substances. See 21 U.S.C \u00a7 \n812(c)II(a)(4) (cocaine), and II(c) (methamphetamine); United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458 (2nd Cir. \n2008) (cocaine); United States v. Wheeler, 535 F.3d 446 (6th Cir. 2008) (methamphetamine).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position, \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well educated \nman. He has been successful working for a defense contractor since 1996. He is \nconsidered to be an above-average software developer and has extensive specialized \nexperience in his field. He is also considered to be an outstanding employee, hard \nworking, dedicated, responsible, and diligent. He has a reputation as a trustworthy and \nhonest person. There is no evidence of any security violation, or that he is not a \ncompetent worker. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, there are more substantial circumstances that weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis. He has been illegally using and purchasing \nmarijuana with varying frequency since the 1990s. When he started working in \ngovernment contracts in 2000, he was aware of what was required of him to be eligible \nfor a public trust position. He deliberately falsified two public trust position applications \nbecause of his concerns about the adverse effects such information would have on his \nprofessional reputation and ability to hold a government job. Notwithstanding, he \ncontinued to illegally use marijuana until October 2007, and he continued to associate \nwith his long-time drug-using friends until his hearing date.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior and personal conduct raise doubts about his suitability to \nhave access to sensitive information, his trustworthiness, and his willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his personal conduct and drug involvement.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \noccupy an ADP I/II/III position. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 42-year-old access control officer employed by a federal contractor. He has worked for his current employer since April 2006. He previously worked for another federal contractor from July 2001 to October 2003 and for a state government from August 2000 to June 2001. He was unemployed from February to August 2000. He worked for a state government from February 1998 to February 2000 and for a private company from January 1995 to February 1998. He previously received a clearance in September 1997.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on August 30, 2007 \n(Government Exhibit (GX) 1). On September 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 31, 2009\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 28, 2008, answered it in an undated \ndocument, and requested determination on the record without a hearing (GX 3). DOHA \nreceived his response on October 14, 2008. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s written case on December 3, 2008. On December 4, 2008, a complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s evidence. Applicant apparently did not receive the FORM, and it was \nresent on May 18, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on May 21, 2009. On June 18, \n2009, he telephonically requested an extension of time to respond, and the deadline \nwas extended to July 6, 2009. He submitted additional evidence on June 26, 2009. The \ncase was assigned to me on July 7, 2009.  \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nThe last four debts alleged in the SOR were mislabeled as 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l. \nThey should have been labeled as 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o. Applicant noted the error in his \nanswer to the SOR, and Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to \nApplicant\u2019s answer. I granted the motion to amend, and the corrections have been \nhandwritten on the SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old access control officer employed by a federal \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since April 2006. He previously \nworked for another federal contractor from July 2001 to October 2003 and for a state \ngovernment from August 2000 to June 2001. He was unemployed from February to \nAugust 2000. He worked for a state government from February 1998 to February 2000 \nand for a private company from January 1995 to February 1998. He previously received \na clearance in September 1997. The record does not reflect whether he currently holds \na clearance. \n \nApplicant was married in June 1998 and divorced in March 2007. He has a child \nfor whom he is obligated to pay child support of $600 per month.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $51,476. Five debts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.j and 1.l) totaling about $33,702 are for student loans. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges \nunpaid state taxes. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.n allege delinquent credit card accounts. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges an unpaid telephone bill. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a child support \narrearage. SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges a deficiency after car repossession. SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges an \nunpaid judgment obtained by a vacation resort. SOR \u00b6 1.o alleges an unspecified \ncollection account. All the delinquent debts were incurred after Applicant\u2019s period of \nunemployment ended in August 2000. \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided evidence that the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were paid, and that he was making payments on the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.j, 1,l, and 1.n. In his response to the FORM, he provided evidence that \n\n \n3\nthe child support arrearage in SOR \u00b6 1.e had been resolved; the balance on the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f had been reduced from $3,526 to $1,492; and the balance on the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n had been reduced from $3,379 to $988. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.d, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.o are not resolved. Applicant has not disputed any of the debts. \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories on June 10, 2008, Applicant stated he had \nbeen making payments to the creditors listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, and 1.n, but had been \nunable to continue the payments because he had been laid off from his employment \n(GX 7 at 15, 25, and 26). This lay-off apparently was from a second job, because in his \nresponse to the FORM dated July 26, 2009, he stated he expected to continue making \nhis monthly payments but that payments on the student loans were reduced due to loss \nof his second job.  \n \nIn a personal financial statement (PFS) attached to the DOHA interrogatories of \nJune 2008, Applicant reported net monthly income of about $2,326, expenses of \n$2,790, and debt payments totaling $395 on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, and \n1.n (GX 7 at 30). It does not reflect any payments on his student loans. If his information \nis accurate, he has a negative cash flow of $559 per month.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s PFS lists real estate worth $400,000. He does not list any mortgage \npayments, but he does list rent of $1,051. His credit report dated April 18, 2008, reflects \na real estate mortgage with payments of $1,056 and a remaining balance of $125,000 \n(GX 7 at 3). The record does not reflect whether this property is Applicant\u2019s residence or \na residence occupied by someone else such as his ex-wife. The record also does not \nreflect whether Applicant could use the equity in this property to repay his delinquent \ndebts.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n \n4\n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n\n \n5\n \nFour potentially disqualifying conditions are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised by \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent spending beyond \none=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative \ncash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(g) is \nraised by \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or \nthe fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). AG \u00b6 19(g) is not \nraised by the state tax debt, because there is no evidence that the debt was caused by \na failure to file a return or by filing a fraudulent return. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established, because Applicant\u2019s debts are recent and numerous, and \nthere is no evidence that they were the result of circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nHis divorce arguably qualified as a circumstance that is unlikely to recur, but he has \nprovided no evidence of the impact of his divorce on his financial situation, other than \nhis obligation to pay child support. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant\u2019s divorce might qualify as a \ncircumstance beyond his control, but he presented no evidence of the financial impact \nof the divorce. He was unemployed from February to August 2000, but he presented no \nevidence showing that this period of unemployment caused his current financial \nproblems. All the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR appear to have been incurred \nafter he returned to the workforce. His loss of a second job appears to have occurred at \nsome time in 2008, long after the debts were already delinquent. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) \nis not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because there is no evidence Applicant has \nsought or received debt counseling. \n\n \n6\n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). The evidence shows that Applicant paid the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, paid the child support arrearage alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e, and has been making payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1j, 1.l, and 1.n. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for these debts, but not for the others alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each \nand every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, \n2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. Id. \n \n \nTo his credit, Applicant negotiated payment plans with three creditors and made \nperiodic payments until he lost his second job. He apparently has been making some \npayments on his student loans, also dependent on his second job. He has no specific \nplan to address the remaining delinquent debts, and he does not appear to have the \nfinancial means to do so.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. \n \n \nMy evaluation of Applicant\u2019s sincerity, candor, and credibility is limited because \nthis case is being decided without a hearing. Applicant has responded in detail to DOHA \n\n \n7\ninquiries, the SOR, and the FORM. Nevertheless, he has provided little information \nabout the impact of his employment lay-offs and his divorce on his financial situation. In \nspite of his efforts to resolve some of his debts, the evidence does not show that he is \nlikely to achieve financial stability in the foreseeable future. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.j: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant, 42 years old, graduated high school and completed several college courses (Tr. 4-5). He married for the first time in 1992 and divorced in 1997. He has two children from his first marriage, a son 14 years old and a daughter 13 years old (GE 1). Both children live with their mother in State B. He has been paying child support since 1999 Applicant\u2019s child support is paid to State A Division of Child Support Enforcement, which then transfers the 4 funds to State B, where Applicant\u2019s children reside. 3 (Answer document 4). Applicant married his current wife in 1997, and they live in State A.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is granted.\nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic Questionnaire\nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on October 25, 2007. After reviewing the results of the\nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and\nDecember 11, 2008\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n \n1\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply\nto all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\n Applicant attached the following eight documents to his Answer: 1: 1998 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition; 2:\n3\nIRS Release of Levy, 2003; 3: State A child support summary statement; 4: State B child support payment\ndocuments; 5: power company debt document; 6: Ford Motor Company debt document; 7: medical debt\ndocument; 8: AT&T debt document.\n2\nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n1\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nOn July 10, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), which\nspecified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).   In his\n2\nAnswer to the SOR,  signed and notarized on August 27, 2008, Applicant admitted to the\n3\nallegation at \u00b61.a. and denied the remaining allegations at \u00b6\u00b61.b. through 1.l. He also\nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 23, 2008, and the case\nwas assigned to me the following day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 22,\n2008 and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 13, 2008.\nDuring the hearing, the government offered five exhibits, marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, and\noffered 22 exhibits as well as the testimony of one witness. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) were\nmarked as A through U, and admitted without objection. I held the record open to allow\nApplicant to submit additional documentation. Department Counsel forwarded without\nobjection Applicant\u2019s timely submission of three additional pages to be added to AE G, and\na two-page document related to allegation 1.l. I admitted the additional document as AE V.\nDOHA received the transcript on November 21, 2008, and the record closed on that day.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admission to allegation 1.a. is admitted as fact. After a thorough review\nof the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the record\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant, 42 years old, graduated high school and completed several college\ncourses (Tr. 4-5). He married for the first time in 1992 and divorced in 1997. He has two\nchildren from his first marriage, a son 14 years old and a daughter 13 years old (GE 1). Both\nchildren live with their mother in State B. He has been paying child support since 1999\n\n Applicant\u2019s child support is paid to State A Division of Child Support Enforcement, which then transfers the\n4\nfunds to State B, where Applicant\u2019s children reside.\n3\n(Answer  document 4). Applicant married his current wife in 1997, and they live in State A.\nHis supervisor characterizes Applicant as an ethical person who car-pools to work and\nexhibits no indication of living an exorbitant lifestyle (Tr. 14-15).\nApplicant was employed as an engineer for defense contractors since 1999, except\nfor one six-month period of unemployment in 2005 (GE 1). His annual income over the past\neight years has fluctuated. In 2000 and 2001, he earned more than $200,000 (AE D). Since\nthen, his income has decreased to $149,000 in 2003, and $119,000 in 2004. In 2005, when\nhe was unemployed, his gross income was $37,486. The following year, it increased to\n$87,000, and in 2007, his gross income was $104,390 (AE H).As of August 2008, Applicant\nearns $8,692 per month. He has owned a rental property for the past four years, which\nreturns $1,250 in rental income. These two income sources result in a monthly gross\nincome of $9,942; after expenses, his net monthly remainder is $2,471. His annual income\nfor 2008 will be approximately $119,000 (AE Q; U).\nThe Statement of Reasons alleges eleven debts. Applicant provided documents\nshowing that his 1998 bankruptcy (allegation 1.a.) was discharged (AE A; Answer document\n1). His exhibits showed the current status of the alleged debts as follows:\n\u2022\nChild support and arrearages: debt to State A Division of Child\nSupport Enforcement (allegations 1.c. and 1.d.) and State B\nDivision of Support Enforcement  (allegation 1.e.): Applicant has\n4\nbeen paying on his support and arrearages since 1999. His debt\nincreased significantly in 2005, when his obligation was re-\nassessed for the three previous years and $27,700 was added in\narrearages. As of July 2008, he had reduced this arrearage to\n$10,871. He paid his child support obligation during his\nunemployment of January to June 2005 (AE I, J, K; Answer\ndocuments 2 and 4); \n\u2022\npower company debt (allegation 1.f.): Paid (AE L; Answer\ndocument 5);\n\u2022\noil company debt (allegation 1.g.): As of September 2008,\nApplicant owes $1,228; he has made two payments under his\npayment plan of $100 per month (AE P; Answer document 5);\n\u2022\nFord Motor Company (allegation 1.h.): As of November 2008, he\nhas made nine payments (including one of $4,253) for a total of\n$5,055 (AE M; Answer document 6);\n\n4\n\u2022\ncredit union debt (allegation 1.i.): the debt was discharged in 1998\nbankruptcy (AE A; Answer document 1);\n\u2022\nmedical debt (allegation 1.j.): Paid (AE N; Answer document 7);\n\u2022\nPalisades/AT&T (allegation 1.k.): Applicant disputes the debt and\nhas informed the attorney who is handling collection (AE O; Answer\ndocument 8);\n\u2022\nCBCS (allegation 1.l.): Paid (AE V).\nAs to the federal tax lien (allegation 1.b.), the record evidence supports the following.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) informed Applicant in March 2003 that a tax levy on his\nsalary had been released (Answer document 2). In May of the same year, the IRS\nrecalculated Applicant\u2019s 2000 tax return and determined that he had underpaid his taxes\nand that the underpayment, along with penalties and interest, amounted to $28,141. In\naddition, the IRS found that he had made an error in his 2001 return and owed an additional\n$16,357 for that tax year (AE B). The two errors resulted in a debt of $44,498. Applicant\nproposed a payment plan to the IRS in September 2003. The plan called for $1,000 per\nmonth to be garnished from Applicant\u2019s salary and future refunds to be applied to his tax\ndebt (AE G). Applicant testified that he paid approximately $13,000 toward the debts\nthrough garnishment, and that he had approximately $17,000 in tax refunds (Tr. 43; 68).\nIn September 2004, Applicant informed the IRS that he was about to be laid off from\nhis job. In response, the IRS issued a Notice of Federal Tax Lien showing that Applicant\nowed $40,733.47 for tax years 2000 and 2001  (Tr. 37; AE F). Applicant\u2019s tax returns for\n2002 through 2007 indicate he was due refunds (AE D). The refunds for 2005 through 2007,\ntotaling $6,495, were credited toward his debt (AE H). \nAfter being unemployed for six months, Applicant found employment in July 2005,\nand tried to re-establish the payment plan. However, the IRS determined that the 2000 and\n2001 back taxes should be classified as \u201cunrecoverable\u201d because Applicant was earning\na lower salary than previously. Applicant\u2019s salary has not been garnished since that time (Tr.\n38).\nApplicant contacted the IRS in July of this year, and then every week in September,\nOctober and November to determine the current status of his account. Three days before\nthe hearing, he was informed that his account was still under review. The day before the\nhearing, he visited the IRS personally, obtained a printout of his account (AE H) and was\ntold the debt for tax years 2000 and 2001 is still classified as \u201cunrecoverable.\u201d AE H\nindicates that Applicant\u2019s account shows a credit of $9,358 for tax year 2004, and\noverpayments (refunds) that were transferred as follows: $2,954 for tax year 2005; $2,648\nfor tax year 2006; and $893 for tax year 2007. However, he was informed that some refunds\nhave been applied and some have not. Applicant has obtained the paperwork to enter into\na new agreement to deduct payments from his salary, which he hopes he will be able to do\nwithin a few weeks following the hearing. (Tr. 39-42).\n\nDirective. 6.3.\n3 \n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n5\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, and\nconsideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the  \u201cwhole person\u201d factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines.\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nIn this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require\nconsideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline\nF (financial considerations).  \n          A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue\n6\nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to\nprove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then\nfalls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable\ndoubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\n\n6\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-extended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b619a (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) applies.\nApplicant\u2019s income has fluctuated significantly over the past several years, and he was\nunemployed for six months in 2005. His income decreased from more than $200,000 in\n2001 to $37,500 in 2005. At the same time, his other expenses continued. His child\nsupport was significantly increased in 2005, the year he was unemployed. All of these\nfactors contributed to Applicant\u2019s inability to pay his debts. AG \u00b619c (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) also applies. Applicant\u2018s credit bureau report shows that he\nhas had several substantial delinquencies over the past five years (GE 2), demonstrating\na history of failing to meet financial obligations. There is no evidence of other disqualifying\nconditions such as frivolous spending, or debts related to alcoholism, gambling or\ndeceptive practices. \nThe Financial Considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate\nsecurity concerns. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20b, AG \u00b6 20c and AG \u00b6 20d apply. \nI find, and the government agrees (Tr. 105), that AG \u00b6 20b applies (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control [e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation], and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant\u2019s\nincome declined steadily over several years, dropping almost 50 percent between 2002\nand 2004. Following this decline, Applicant experienced six months of unemployment in\n2005, earning only one-fifth of his 2002 income. When he found employment, his income\nwas not at the previous levels, and it has not returned to the level he was earning between\n2000 and 2002. Despite these financial setbacks, he acted responsibly and continued\nmaking his child support payments (AE I).\nApplicant has paid the debts to the power company, and CBCS, as well as the\nmedical debt. He has established a payment plan for the debts to the oil company and\nFord Motor Company. Applicant disputes the debt to Palisades/AT&T and has informed\nthe debt collector. The judgments owed to the credit union were discharged in his\nbankruptcy 10 years ago. Although he does have arrearages in his child support, his\npayments have reduced the arrearages by approximately $17,000 in the past 3 years\n(Answer document 3). The record evidence supports his contention that he has been\nmeeting this obligation consistently for almost 10 years, including the period when he was\nunemployed. \n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s underpayment of federal income tax in 2000 and error on his 2001\nreturn resulted in the IRS issuing a lien against him and assessing interest and penalties\nin 2003. Soon after the lien was issued, Applicant contacted the IRS and established a\nplan to pay $1,000 per month through deductions from his salary. Any tax refunds would\nalso be credited to pay his debt. However, following his unemployment in 2005, the IRS\nwould not re-institute the wage garnishment because of his significantly lower salary. It\nappears that through the earlier payments, and the transferred refunds, he has paid more\nthan half of the IRS debt. Applicant credibly testified that he has persistently endeavored\nto work with the IRS to resolve the situation. I find that all of these facts, and the record\nevidence, support application of both AG \u00b6 20c (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control) and AG \u00b6 20d (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) apply. \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all\nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding this case. \nApplicant accrued significant debt over the past several years. His financial\nproblems resulted largely from a steady decline in his income, followed by unemployment.\nHowever, he has paid several smaller debts, and set up payment plans for two larger\ndebts. Over more than nine years, he consistently met his obligation to support his\nchildren. Throughout a difficult problem with the IRS, he acted with reason and maturity.\nApplicant\u2019s well-documented efforts demonstrate a sincere intent to meet his financial\nobligations. A fair and common-sense assessment of the available information bearing\non Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he has satisfied the doubts about\nhis ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests.\n\n8\nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1, Guideline F\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to classified\ninformation.

She has been a truck driver since 1996, and currently ids a truck driver with her husband. She seeks a secret security clearance. On May 27, 2008 (GE 2), Applicant completed a personal financial statement (PFS) showing she was earning about $10,382.00 a month, minus $3,696.00 in monthly expenses and $1,938.00 in monthly payments, leaving a monthly remainder of $4,748.00 a month. Financial Considerations (FC) After the parents of Applicant\u2019s husband became seriously ill in 2002, Applicant and her husband moved to his parents\u2019 living location so that Applicant could take care of them while her husband continued to work. Applicant stopped working to care for them (Tr. 27). The record is silent on when his parents passed away. I find from her 2 husband\u2019s testimony (Tr. 35) that their passing occurred in 2004. The move caused financial problems for Applicant and her husband. Her husband recalled becoming delinquent on four or five debts, including the debt to the truck credit company (SOR 1.I, Tr. 30; AE F).

The action was taken\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on August 29, 2008. DOHA issued a\nNotice of Hearing on October 3, 2008, and the hearing was held on October 29, 2008.\nAt the hearing, four exhibits (GE 1 through 4) were admitted in evidence without\nobjection to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and placed exhibits AE A\nthrough AE H in evidence. The government\u2019s objection to AE D and AE E was\nJanuary 26, 2009\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\noverruled. At the close of the hearing, the government moved to admit statutes of the\nUnited States (U.S.) Code of Federal Regulations in evidence to establish the\ndeclarations in AE D and E were invalid. Applicant\u2019s objection to the motions was\nsustained. DOHA received the transcript on November 6, 2008. \nIn the time allowed for Applicant to submit additional documentation, she\nsubmitted AE I through AE U that were objected to by the government when the initial\nhearing request was made to keep the record open for 10 days after the close of the\nhearing. The objection for additional time to present additional exhibits was overruled at\nthe hearing (Tr. 99). On November 12, 2008, the government furnished me with the\nApplicant\u2019s post hearing exhibits, and renewed its objections to the post hearing exhibits\nfor the same reasons expressed during the hearing. The objections to the admission of\nthe post hearing exhibits are overruled. The post hearing exhibits contain updated\ninformation addressing several of the debts listed in the SOR, and Applicant\u2019s statement\nthat she was looking for another debt plan. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nRulings on Procedure\nBefore the hearing on September 23, 2008, the government made a motion to\namend the SOR (Amendment to the SOR) by adding Paragraph 2 (personal conduct,\nGuideline E) with two subparagraphs. That motion appears as GE 5. The exhibit\nincludes both the Government\u2019s motion and Applicant\u2019s reply dated September 30,\n2008. In her reply, she denied both subparagraphs of the Amendment to the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s answer to the Paragraph 2 of SOR was transmitted to the government by\nfacsimile. Pursuant to \u00b6 E.3.1.13 of DoD Directive 5220.6, the motion to amend the\nSOR adding paragraph 2, and two subparagraphs is granted. The motion appears as\nfollows:\n2. Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process. Available information raising this concern shows that:\na. You falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nprocessing (e-QIP) executed by you on August 28, 2007, on which you were required to\nreply to the following question, Section 27: Your Financial record b. In the last 7\nyears, have you had your wages garnished or had any property repossessed fro\nany reason?\u201d You answered \u201cNo\u201d to that question; whereas in truth, you deliberately\nfailed to disclose the repossession of your automobile as set forth in subparagraph 1.I,\nof the Statement of Reasons. \n\n Codified to 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.6\n1\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nAnswer: ADMIT  or  DENY (After circling the word DENY, Applicant provided her\ninitials.)\nb. You falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-Qip), executed by you on August 28, 2007, on which you were required\nto reply to the following questions, \u201cSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies a. In\nthe last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)? [and] b.\nAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d  You answered \u201cNo\u201d to\nboth of those questions; whereas in truth, you deliberately failed to disclose the debts\nset forth in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g. 1g, 1.I, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.p, 1.q,\nand 1.r of the SOR.\nAnswer: ADMIT or DENY (After circling the word DENY, Applicant provided her initials.)\nAt the hearing, the government objected to the introduction of AE D and AE E\nbecause: (1) the proponent was representing himself as an expert in financial matters\nand his allegations of improper methodology or deceptive acts used by the creditors in\nreporting overdue debts; and, (2) the stated opinions provided by the proponent\nregarding how certain financial accounts were being reported in Applicant\u2019s credit report\nshould be considered hearsay (Tr. 15-19). I overruled the objection, and indicated the\nexhibits would be offered for the limited purpose of demonstrating Applicant sought\nfinancial help, and did enroll in a debt consolidation plan (Tr. 18-19).\nBefore the closing-arguments portion of the case, the government cited Title 15\nU.S. Code (U.S.C.), the statutory authority for Section 1691 and Regulation B of the\nCode of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 202  to establish that the certifications\n1\nmade by the declarant in AE E of Applicant\u2019s credit worthiness are inaccurate. Applicant\nobjected based on my earlier ruling regarding both exhibits AE D and AE E, indicating\nthe declarations of the declarant had no other meaning except to show Applicant was\nenrolled in a debt consolidation program. Because of my earlier ruling (Tr. 17-18)\nregarding AE D and AE E, I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to the government\u2019s\nstatutory argument (Tr. 97).\nPost hearing exhibits AE I through AE U. On November 12, 2008, the\nGovernment renewed their objections to the proposed exhibits on the grounds they\nwere untimely and denied the Government an opportunity to cross-examine the source\nof the information. I am overruling the objection because I usually allow the parties to\npresent additional evidence after the hearing to promote the development of a full\nrecord, and do so herein.\n\n However, GE 1 shows no break in employment during the period of the parents\u2019 illness. Applicant was\n2\nemployed from August 2000 to October 2003 by a transportation company. From October 2003 to April 2006,\nApplicant was employed by another transportation company.\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR lists 18 debts under the financial considerations guideline. The second\nguideline (paragraph 2, personal conduct) lists two allegations. Applicant denied all\nallegations under paragraphs 1 and 2.\nApplicant has been married since 1999. She has two children ages 30 and 23\n(Tr. 70). She has been a truck driver since 1996, and currently ids a truck driver with her\nhusband. She seeks a secret security clearance. On May 27, 2008 (GE 2), Applicant\ncompleted a personal financial statement (PFS) showing she was earning about\n$10,382.00 a month, minus $3,696.00 in monthly expenses and $1,938.00 in monthly\npayments, leaving a monthly remainder of $4,748.00 a month. \nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nAfter the parents of Applicant\u2019s husband became seriously ill in 2002, Applicant\nand her husband moved to his parents\u2019 living location so that Applicant could take care\nof them while her husband continued to work. Applicant stopped working to care for\nthem (Tr. 27).  The record is silent on when his parents passed away. I find from her\n2\nhusband\u2019s testimony (Tr. 35) that their passing occurred in 2004. The move caused\nfinancial problems for Applicant and her husband. Her husband recalled becoming\ndelinquent on four or five debts, including the debt to the truck credit company (SOR 1.I,\nTr. 30; AE F). When they could no longer afford the installment payments on the truck,\nthey turned the truck into the dealer before it was repossessed (Tr. 31, 63). Applicant\u2019s\nhusband recalled they may have missed one installment payment on the vehicle before\nreturning it, and they continued to make monthly payments to a law firm on the\ndeficiency balance after the car was auctioned (Tr. 31-33). Applicant\u2019s husband called\nthe truck company and the company\u2019s law firm many times because the truck debt was\ninaccurately reported on the wife\u2019s credit report (Tr. 33). No additional evidence was\nprovided. \nApplicant\u2019s husband recalled some of the other reported delinquent accounts,\nincluding the accounts identified in SOR 1.j and 1.l (Tr. 34). Her husband remembered\ncontacting several of the creditors by phone for an extension of time to pay, but only two\nagreed to provide extra time for payment (Tr. 36). \nThe first time Applicant and her husband contacted the debt consolidation\nservice (AE D) was in June 2008. According to her husband, at the time of the hearing,\nthe service was in the process of restructuring a payment plan after first determining\nwhich creditors were the actual holders of the delinquent accounts (Tr. 37-38).\nApplicant\u2019s husband was certain that his wife, who handles the payments to the debt\n\n The last activity refers to the last time action was taken on the account, e.g., making a payment or rewriting\n3\nthe underlying contract under different terms. \n She modified her testimony by indicating she did not have actual proof that the debt service was paying the\n4\ncreditor but she could access that information by calling the debt service (Tr. 56-57). No information was\nprovided. \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nservice, made seven documented payments of $380.00 under the plan (Tr. 38-39, 55).\nApplicant testified she did not have an opinion about the debt service even though she\nhad been contacting them about once a month (Tr. 62-63). Applicant has receipts of\npayments to the debt service, and also proof of making at least eight payments of\n$125.00 to the truck credit company (SOR 1.I, Tr. 50-51, 94).\nApplicant\u2019s husband testified that he and his wife knew they had delinquent debt\nafter 2002, and even talked about the debt problems (Tr. 41). Applicant\u2019s husband\nindicated he was about to launch his own documented plan to eliminate the debt and\nstart up his own business (Tr. 41-42). No additional information was furnished regarding\nthe husband\u2019s plan. Applicant\u2019s husband noted that, \u201cIt had been quite a long time since\nmy wife and I had run a credit report on her (Tr. 40).\u201d\nThe 18 debts shall be discussed in the order they appear in the SOR. The debts\ntotal $39,966.00. \n\u2022 1.a. $14.00. The last activity  reported by the credit agency on this debt was\n3\nOctober 2005 (GE 4). Applicant initially denied the debt was her responsibility (Tr. 51-\n52). Applicant submitted an unprocessed check of $14.00 to the creditor on November\n1, 2008. I find for Applicant under SOR 1.a. even though the check (and the remaining\nchecks presented in Applicant\u2019s post hearing submission) is not the best evidence that\nthe overdue accounts were paid. \n\u2022 1.b. $126.00. The last activity on this debt was May 2002. Applicant admitted\nthe debt, and initially stated this account was being paid through her debt consolidation\nservice (Tr. 52).  In AE J, Applicant paid the creditor $126.00 on November 1, 2008.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s payment of the debt after indicating the debt was being paid by the debt\nservice warrants a finding for Applicant under SOR 1.b.\n\u2022 1.c. $1,451.00. Applicant denies she owes the delinquent account. The last\nactivity on the debt is November 2001. No additional information was provided. SOR\n1.c. is resolved against Applicant. \n\u2022 1.d. $1,164.00. Applicant denies she owes the debt. The last activity on this\naccount was in July 2002. No additional evidence was provided on this account. The\naccount is resolved against Applicant. \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\n\u2022 1.e. $147.00. GE 4 indicates that this debt and the one identified in 1.f. are the\nsame. Applicant admits she owes the account (Tr. 53). The last activity on this debt was\nFebruary 2004. Applicant paid the debt on November 1, 2008 (AE K). This\nsubparagraph is found for Applicant. \n\u2022 1.g. $1,168.00. Applicant denies she owes this account (Tr. 54). The last\nactivity on this account was July 2001. Applicant settled the account a check for\n$584.00 dated November 1, 2008 to the collection agency. I find this account in her\nfavor. \n\u2022 1.h. $4,303.00. The last activity on the account is June 2001. Applicant\nadmitted the debt but denied the amount because she had a $500.00 limit on her\naccount. No additional information was provided. I find against Applicant under SOR\n1.h. \n\u2022 1.i. $25,034.00. The last activity on this account is January 2002. Applicant\nreturned the truck before it was repossessed because they anticipated they could no\nlonger afford the installment payments. Applicant denies the amount alleged in SOR 1.i.\nConcerning payments made to the 1.i. creditor, the contents of the AE R show Applicant\nmade sporadic payments between August 2002 and November 2007. For example, she\nmade a payment in December 2006 and May 2007. AE R contains two reply letters from\nthe credit company\u2019s law firm thanking her for the two aforementioned payments. The\nlast two pages of AE R are dated November 16, 2007, and reflect a balance in SOR 1.i.\nof $3,928.00, not $25,034.00 as alleged in SOR 1.i., but twice as much as the amount\nshe claimed in her testimony (Tr. 93-94). SOR 1.i. is resolved against Applicant. \n\u2022 1.j. $143.00. The last activity on this debt was May 2001. Applicant admitted the\ndebt, but indicated she was making payments through the debt service plan (Tr. 55). AE\nM indicates that Applicant did not pay the debt until November 1, 2008. Subparagraph\n1.j. is found for Applicant.  \n\u2022 1.k. $131.00. The last activity on this account was October 2005. After initially\ndenying this debt, she paid the creditor on November 1, 2008 with a check for $131.00\n(AE N). SOR 1.k. is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\u2022 1.l. $381.00. GE 4 reflects this is the same account as SOR 1.p. The last\nactivity on this account was June 2001. Applicant believed her debt service was making\npayments on the account, and she could obtain the payment information from the debt\nservice official (Tr. 55-56). AE O shows Applicant paid the creditor on November 1,\n2008. SOR 1.l. is resolved for Applicant.\n\u2022 1.m. 1,389.00. The last activity on this account was September 2001. Applicant\nadmitted the debt but denies the amount. I find Applicant owes this account.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\n\u2022 1.n. $1,643.00. The last activity on this account was June 2002. Applicant\nadmitted this debt, but denied the amount. She averred the debt is the same as the\naccount identified in SOR 1.r. There is insufficient information in the credit reports to\ncorroborate her claim. Though she testified the debt was being paid through the debt\nservice plan (Tr. 58-59), she subsequently withdrew from the plan (AE T). She\npresented no independent evidence supporting her testimony that the debt was being\npaid through the service plan. I find against Applicant under SOR 1.n. and 1.r.\n\u2022 1.o. $47.00. Though GE 4 reflects the last activity on the account was\nSeptember 2007, Applicant paid the account off in October 2005 (AE P). SOR 1.o. is\nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\u2022 1.p. $278.00. See SOR 1.l. this account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\u2022 1.q. $159.00. The last activity on the account was in November 2004. Applicant\ninitially denied the debt. She presented AE Q to support her claim the debt was paid.\nApplicant\u2019s handwritten statements in AE Q are not sufficient to verify payment made.\nSOR 1.q. is resolved against Applicant.\n\u2022 1.r. $2,275.00. See SOR 1.n. This account is resolved against Applicant.\nAfter the double entries (SOR 1.f., and 1.p.) are subtracted from the total\ndelinquent debt in the SOR ($39,966.00), the total debt is $39,575.00. Next, when the\ndebt for the truck (SOR 1.i., $25,034.00) is reduced to approximately $4,000.00 (AE R,\nthe current balance with additional interest added), then subtracted from $39,575.00,\nthe delinquent debt Applicant owes to 16 creditors is $18,575.00. After subtracting\n$1573.00 (the amount Applicant repaid to eight creditors plus two creditors with double\nentries) from $18,575.00, Applicant still owes eight creditors $17,002.00.\nApplicant has never had financial counseling (Tr. 86). Applicant claimed she\nemploys a month-to-month budget although the income she and her husband earn\nchanges every week (Tr. 86-87). \nAE U consists of 14 pages, and represents the documents relating to Applicant\u2019s\ndebt service plan which she joined in May 2008. A number of figures appear on the first\npage (monthly installment agreement), including the monthly payment of $380.00, and\nthe total fee of $9,000.00. After initial payments were by Applicant in May and June\n2008, the AE U contains only her promise to pay certain amounts. There is no\nverification in the exhibit that Applicant made seven payments of $380.00 as testified by\nher husband (Tr. 38). Lastly, there is no list of creditors included in the plan and/or\npayout amounts.\nIn AE T, dated November 4, 2008, Applicant expressed dissatisfaction with her\ndebt service plan, indicating she was misled. She stated she would be addressing the\nother debts that are not hers through another service. She intended to pay all her\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\naccounts in a timely fashion. She provided no evidence showing she had actually\nenrolled in another plan. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nOn August 28, 2007, Applicant signed a security clearance questionnaire (SCA).\nIn response to question 27b. requiring information about garnishments or\nrepossessions, Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d Even though her truck was repossessed in\n2002, the surrounding circumstances of the event support a finding she did not\ndeliberately omit the information. \nIn the same questionnaire, question 28a., Applicant also denied she had any\ndebts over 180 days delinquent in the last 7 years. In response to question 28b., she\ndenied she had any debts over 90 days delinquent. After weighing and balancing the\ntestimony of Applicant and her husband, there are a number of inconsistencies in her\nclaims that undermine her overall credibility. However, due to forgetfulness and the lack\nof financial counseling, I am unable to make the factual finding that she deliberately\nconcealed the information from questions 28a. and 28b. of her SCA in August 2007. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant submitted several character letters beginning with a coworker/friend\nwho has known Applicant for five years. The coworker considers Applicant trustworthy.\nBased on her observation of Applicant for about a year, a second coworker and friend\nknows that Applicant loves her job and is very security conscious. A third character\nstatement comes from Applicant\u2019s national congressman who advised Applicant that the\nappropriate government officials had been contacted, and that the congressman would\nmonitor the case. \nA driver and manager of Applicant\u2019s employer noted that he considers Applicant\ntrustworthy based on his interaction with her since early 2008. The facility security\nofficer (FSO) has known Applicant professionally wince February 2008, and is\nappreciative of Applicant\u2019s dependability, leadership, and attention to detail. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n9\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nFC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\napplies to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. When the SOR was published, Applicant owed\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n10\nmore than $39,900.00 she was unable to pay. There are more than 16 overdue debts\nlisted with delinquency dates as early as 2001. FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations) also applies. \nThe mitigating conditions have been evaluated. FC mitigating condition (MC)\n20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply, as Applicant still\nowes eight creditors approximately $17,002.00. The number of delinquent debts,\namount of the debt, and age of the listed accounts, continues to cast doubt on\nApplicant\u2019s current reliability, and judgment. Applicant\u2019s initial representations that some\nof the debts were being paid by the debt service plan, and later declaration that she had\nwithdrawn from the plan because she had been misled, undermines her credibility. Her\ncredibility is weakened further by the absence of supporting documentation of her claim\nof having made a number of $380.00 payments to the debt service, and $125.00\npayments to the law firm. \nThe mitigation Applicant receives under FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control) is\nsubstantially reduced because the illnesses to the parents of Applicant\u2019s husband\noccurred over four years ago. In addition, GE 1 reflects that Applicant did not\nexperience a break in employment as her husband testified. FC MC 20.b. has only\nlimited application. \nFC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control)\nreceives limited favorable attention due to the fact Applicant has never received\ncounseling. Though she claimed she had a monthly budget to manage her finances,\nshe declined to produce evidence to support her testimony. While exercising good\njudgment to enroll in a debt service to gain control over her financial troubles, she no\nlonger is involved in the service. Applicant receives limited mitigation under FC MC 20.c.\nApplicant would have received significant mitigation under FC MC 20.d. (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts) had she been more forthright about her debts. However, given her lack of candor\nin explaining the status of several of the debts, and misrepresenting the payment she\nmade to the debt service plan and the credit company law firm in SOR 1.i., her\nmitigating evidence is insufficient to prevail over her history of failing to meet financial\nobligations.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n11\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answers to both debt questions (28.a., 28.b.) of his SCA in\nAugust 2007 activates PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission, falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire used to determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness) Applicant repeatedly denied omitting factual information\nfrom her SCA. While there are significant inconsistencies between Applicant\u2019s and her\nhusband\u2019s testimony that impact negatively on Applicant\u2019s credibility, I am unable to\nconclude that Applicant deliberately omitted her financial information. I have considered\nher change of positions concerning several of her debts. I have considered her claims\nshe made about the truck and debt service. It is reasonable to conclude she forgot\nabout the debts because of their age. I find it also reasonable to conclude she did not\ninclude the truck as one of the delinquent debts because she thought, though\nincorrectly, that the truck debt may have been resolved when she returned the vehicle\nto the dealer. Without the element, PC DC 16.a. does not apply. Accordingly, the PC\nguideline is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence under the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of\nthe FC, PC and CC guidelines. I have also weighed the circumstances of this case\nwithin the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI have considered the facts of this case in light of the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions of the FC guideline, and also in light of the general factors of the whole\nperson concept. The statements of five of Applicant\u2019s coworkers and friends\ndemonstrate that Applicant is dependable and trustworthy. However, these statements\ndo not include any probative information of whether these declarants are familiar with\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems. Based on the time line of when the debts became\ndelinquent, Applicant has a seven-year history of financial problems. Though the\nevidence suggests Applicant deliberately omitted material financial information from her\nSCA, there is insufficient evidence for me to conclude that she deliberately concealed\nher debts from her SCA and the government in August 2007. On the other hand,\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n12\nApplicant has not met her burden of persuasion under the FC guideline by not\ndemonstrating more responsibility in managing her finances. \nHaving evaluated the evidence as a whole, Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns associated with her financial problems. Applicant exercised good\njudgment by finally taking responsibility for nine of the debts listed in the SOR. But,\ngiven the lack of evidence showing that the debts in SOR 1.c., 1.d., 1.h., 1.i., 1.m., 1.n.,\nand 1.r. are being addressed, the record is insufficient to conclude that Applicant has\nsuccessfully mitigated the continuing security concerns associated with her financial\nindebtedness. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.\nFor Aplicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r. \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor Applicant\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Accordingly, his request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \nOn November 30, 2006, Applicant submitted a security clearance \napplication (Standard Form 86) to request a security clearance required as part \n \n 1  \nSeptember 22, 2009\n\n \n 2  \n                                                     \nof his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative \nfinding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nrequest.  \n \n \nOn March 17, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 In his Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized \non April 27, 2009, Applicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline F except \nsubparagraph 1.p. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 18, 2009 and the \ncase was assigned to me on May 27, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nJune 3, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 1, 2009. During \nthe hearing, the government offered five exhibits, marked as Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified, and did not offer exhibits or witness testimony. I held the record open for \nApplicant to submit additional documentation in support of his case. He timely \nsubmitted one document, admitted without objection as Applicant's Exhibit (AE) \nA. DOHA received the transcript on July 10, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After \na thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nevidence presented by both parties, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant, 29 years old, is a high school graduate who completed \napproximately one semester of community college in 1998. He is single and has \nthree children between the ages of seven and nine years. All three children live \nwith their mothers. Applicant served in the U.S. Army from 1999 to 2003, and \ndetached at pay grade E-4. He currently serves in the active reserves. He did not \nhold a security clearance while in the military and does not currently hold one. \nAppellant was unemployed for about 11 months in 2003 to 2004, after leaving \nactive duty, and received unemployment compensation. He was again \nunemployed from approximately November 2005 to November 2006, but earned \n \n1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in \nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations \nin which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n 3  \nabout $1,800 for part-time reserve duty from April to November 2006. He did not \nreceive unemployment compensation during this period. He lived with his family \nwhen he was unemployed. For the past two-and-one-half years, he has worked \nfor a defense contractor as a security officer, which primarily involves building \naccess control. Applicant also holds a part-time job with an agency that provides \ncounseling for inner-city youth (GE 1; Tr. 21-22, 82, 84-85, 88, 92-93, 96). \n \n \nApplicant earns an annual salary of approximately $54,000. After taxes, \nchild support and other deductions, his monthly net take-home pay is \napproximately $1,260. He also earns approximately $138 per month net from a \npart-time job counseling youth, and about $230 per month from reserves. \nApplicant shares living expenses with a roommate. His monthly expenses include \n$550 rent, $100 utilities, $182 car insurance, $120 gas, $60 groceries, and $150 \nin extra expenses for his children. He purchased a 2006 car in 2007, for which he \npays $389 per month. He has about $300 in a checking account and about $200 \nin savings. He has no investments or retirement plans, and no credit cards. His \nmonthly net remainder is approximately $50 (GE 2; Tr. 84, 98-114). \n \n \nApplicant accrued significant delinquencies since 2000. He attributes his \nfinancial problems to being young and foolish. In 2008, Applicant talked twice \nwith a debt consolidation service that offered to work with him on debt \nmanagement, a budget, and a payout plan that required him to pay a certain \namount, which the company would pay to the creditors. It also charged a fee in \naddition to the amount he was required to pay toward each debt In addition, he \nwas required to contact the creditors himself, and he had found it difficult to reach \nthem. Applicant also did not follow through with the company because it advised \nhim that the best approach would be to file a bankruptcy petition. He did not wish \nto file bankruptcy for $15,000, which he considered to be a small amount of debt. \n(GE 3; Tr. 64-70, 98). \n \n \nApplicant's debts, as alleged in the SOR, total $14,660. In his interrogatory \nresponses of July and October 2008, Applicant indicated that he had contacted \nnumerous creditors and set up payment plans with some. He also included \ncopies of checks he wrote to 15 creditors. However, he did not mail these checks \nbecause he needed the money for an unexpected death in his family (GE 2, 3, 4, \n5; Tr. 64). The status of the SOR debts follows. \n \n\u2022 \nAuto loan \u2013- $6,566 (allegation 1.a.) \u2013 Unpaid. Applicant was in an \naccident and his car was a total loss. He stopped making loan payments. \nThe debt has been delinquent since 2004. In February 2009, Applicant \ncontacted the creditor, who offered a lump-sum settlement of $3,000. \nApplicant testified that he has saved $1,500 toward the payment, but \noffered no documentation to support his claim of a settlement offer or his \nsavings (Tr. 22-25).  \n \n\n \n 4  \n\u2022 \nCommunications (debts related to cell phones and land lines) - \n$1,934 (allegations 1.c., 1.i., 1.j., and 1.l.): Unpaid. Applicant testified that \nhe is unsure whether the debt at 1.c. is his debt. He has not contacted the \ncompany or disputed it with the credit reporting agencies, and it remains \nunpaid. He contacted the creditor alleged in 1.i. in February 2009 for \ninformation about paying the debt, but has not paid it. He has not \ncontacted the creditor alleged in 1.j. He does not recognize the debt \nalleged in 1.l., but has not contacted the creditor or the credit reporting \nagencies to dispute it (Tr. 28-29, 39-43).  \n \n$ \nUtilities - $326 (allegation 1.d.): Unpaid. Applicant contacted the creditor    \nin approximately February 2009 to get information about how and where \nto pay the debt but does not have sufficient funds to pay it (Tr. 30-31).  \n \n$ \nRetail store - $291 (allegation 1.e.): Unpaid. Applicant has not contacted \nthe creditor concerning this debt (Tr. 31-32).  \n \n$   \nRent - $1,166 (allegation 1.h.): Unpaid. In 2004, Applicant notified the \nrental agent that he was leaving his apartment within two weeks. He left \nbefore the term of the lease ended because a person was murdered in the \nparking lot. He was penalized approximately three months\u2019 rent. He has \nnot contacted the creditor (Tr. 36-39).  \n \n$   \nCredit cards - $2,235 (allegations 1.b., 1.f.): Unpaid. The account listed at \nallegation 1.b. became delinquent in 2002. Applicant stopped making \npayments on the account. He contacted the creditor sometime before \nFebruary 2009 but was told his account was transferred to an unknown \ncollection company. Allegation 1.f. relates to a store credit card. Applicant \ntried to reach the creditor in February 2009 but the number did not work \nand he believes that the company no longer exists. He did not investigate \nfurther (GE 4, 5; Tr. 25-28, 32-34).  \n \n$   \nTax-related debt - $146 (allegation 1.g.): Unpaid. Applicant does not \nrecognize this debt. He has not contacted the credit reporting agencies to \ndispute it (Tr. 34-36).  \n \n$        Medical debts - $759 (allegations 1.k., 1.m \u2013 1.o.): Unpaid. These debts \nrelate to medical expenses for Applicant's children. He has not contacted \nthe creditors. (Tr. 41-46).  \n \n$        Federal agency - $1,247 (allegation 1.p.): Partially paid. Applicant owed \nthe agency for a class from which he withdrew. In April 2008, he filed his \n2006 income tax return late, with his 2007 federal income tax return. He \nwas owed income tax refunds of $637 for tax year 2006, and $3,641 for \ntax year 2007, as well as a $600 economic stimulus check. Although \nApplicant's July 2009 credit bureau report shows that he still owes $1,247, \nApplicant provided documentation showing that he owes less. The federal \n\n \n 5  \n                                                     \nagency seized $637 from his 2006 federal income tax refund, and $467 \nfrom his 2007 economic stimulus check, and applied both to pay the debt, \nleaving a remainder of $142.3 Applicant testified that he spoke with the \nagency twice and confirmed that he no longer owes the remaining \namount, but provided no documentation to support that contention (GE 3; \nAE A; Tr. 46-55). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-\nsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and material \ninformation, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in \nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect \nconsideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred \nto as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does \nnot determine a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of \naccess to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information \npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and \nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) at \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the \ninitial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the \npreliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. \nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to \nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a \nheavy burden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information \n \n3 Applicant currently owes back child support of approximately $5,000 for one of his three \nchildren. The state that collects this child support seized $132 from his 2007 stimulus check and \n$3,641 from his 2007 income tax refund to pay back child support. Applicant's pay is garnished to \npay child support. The child support arrearages are not alleged in the SOR (GE 3; Tr. 55-59). \n \n4 Directive 6.3 \n \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n\n \n 6  \n                                                     \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and \nconfidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring \neach Applicant possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect \nthe national interests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \nindividual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a \nconcern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is \nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b619 (a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Applicant owes approximately $14,000 in \ndelinquent debt that he has been unable or unwilling to pay. His debts became \ndelinquent starting in 2000, and, but for one that is partially paid, they remain \ndelinquent, indicating a history of failure to meet financial obligations. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; \n \n \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n 7  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue. \n \n \nApplicant's debts have been accruing since approximately 2000, and they \ndid not occur under unusual circumstances. He has now been employed full-time \nfor the past two-and-one-half years, and he earns income from a part-time job as \nwell as reserve pay. Applicant testified that he saved $1,500, yet he did not use \nthis money to pay any of his delinquencies, which raises questions as to his \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant experienced some periods of unemployment between 2003 and \n2006. However, his family assisted him financially during this period by allowing \nhim to live at home. Applicant has not acted responsibly to deal with his \nsignificant debts. He purchased a new or relatively new 2006 automobile in the \nspring of 2007, and he now pays almost $400 per month on that vehicle. In \naddition, on the day he submitted his Interrogatory response (GE 2), he wrote \nchecks to numerous creditors, but he did not mail the checks because he needed \nthe funds for a family emergency. Finally, he testified that he has saved a \nsubstantial amount \u2013 $1,500 \u2013 but has not used these funds to make payments \non his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) cannot be applied. \n \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. Applicant was on notice that \ndelinquent debts were a security concern after he completed his security \nclearance application in 2006. He did make some effort at obtaining help with his \nfinances by contacting a debt consolidation company two years later, in 2008. \nHowever, he did not follow through with that company\u2019s advice and made no \nfurther efforts to obtain financial assistance. Moreover, Applicant's financial \nsituation is not under control. Although the debt to the federal agency is partially \npaid, he still owes more than $13,000. This debt was not paid through Applicant's \ngood-faith efforts, but by the agency\u2019s seizure of Applicant's income tax refunds \nand stimulus check. The rest of the SOR debts are unpaid, with no payment \nplans in place, and no documentation to support his claims of contacts with the \ncreditors. Without documentation of payments or payment plans, a good-faith \neffort to resolve debts cannot be substantiated.  \n \n\n \n 8  \n \nApplicant disputes the three debts at \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.g., and 1.l. He provided no \nevidence to support his claim and has not contacted the creditors or credit \nreporting agencies to report the disputes. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. I find \nagainst Applicant under Guideline F. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate \nthe Applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented \nand have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I \nhave also reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or \nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the \nappropriate guideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n \n \nAs Applicant was in his twenties at the time most of his debts became past \ndue, his failure to respond to them may have resulted in part from inexperience \nand a lack of sound financial judgment. However, several questionable decisions \nwere made more recently--to take on a substantial car payment in 2007 and to \nignore the advice of the debt consolidation company.

Maryland, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,  I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September\n26, 2007. On August 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F\nand E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 13, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on September 16, 2008, admitted all the SOR allegations and\nApril 20, 2009\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated September 26, 2007); Tr. 23, 100.\n1\nGE 3 (Interrogatories) at 3; GE 4 (Interrogatories) at 5; Tr. 35-36, 110-111.\n2\n2\nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on\nSeptember 19, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 6,\n2008, and I received the case assignment on January 22, 2009. DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing on January 30, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February\n26, 2009. The government offered four exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received\nand admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He\nsubmitted 18 exhibits (AE) A through R, which were received and admitted into\nevidence without objection. The record closed on February 26, 2009. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 10, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel proffered to stipulate to the fact \u201cthat at some\npoint in 2007, the debts listed in the SOR went into collection.  After much discussion,\nthe parties agreed to amend the SOR allegations 1.a through 1.l. by deleting the\nlanguage \u201cplaced for collection\u201d with a date for collection, which is near the end of the\nfirst sentence in each allegation. The language identifying the creditor and the amount\nof the debt would remain as would the second sentence, which read: \u201cAs of June 18,\n2008, this debt had not been paid.\u201d I granted the change in the SOR as agreed by the\nparties. (Tr. 34)\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 33 years old and single. At the time he completed his SF-86,\nApplicant worked for a Department of Defense Contractor. He has been offered another\nposition with a different Department of Defense contractor which requires a security\nclearance.1\nApplicant worked with temporary agency in the fall 2006. His job ended at the\nend of December 2006. In January 2007, Applicant became seriously ill with\npneumonia. He did not work the entire month of January 2007. Applicant obtained a 90-\nday temporary job in February 2007. When this job ended in May 2007, he did not work\nfor two weeks.  \n2\nOn June 1, 2007, Applicant began working for a major United States (U.S.)\nairline as a baggage handler. On June 30, 2007, he suffered a heart attack on the job.\nHis doctor released him to return to work in October 2007. He had no insurance at this\n\nGE 4, supra note 2, at 3; Tr. 37-38, 111.\n3\nGE 4, supra note 2; Tr. 102-104.\n4\nGE 4, supra note 2, at 4-5; Tr. 100-104. \n5\nSOR; GE 3, supra note 2, attachments; AE G (Settlement offer); Tr. 49, 56-57, 60-65, 73, 75, 79, 83, 83-86,\n6\n90, 105.\n3\ntime and workers compensation benefits did not pay his medical expenses. He paid his\nmedical bills related to his heart attack.3\nOn October 1, 2007, Applicant began employment with a Department of Defense\ncontractor. In November 2007, Applicant began a second job to help pay the expenses\nhe had incurred while unemployed. On December 12, 2007, he suffered a stroke. His\nmedical insurance provider paid his medical bills. Applicant did not return to work until\nApril 2008. Subsequent to his stroke, Applicant has been diagnosed with trigemenal\nneuralgia.4\nApplicant started a position with a contractor in April 2008. His net earnings with\nthis employer totaled $1,300 a month, which is $700 less than he was earning prior to\nhis stroke in December 2007. His most recent employer laid him off in January 2009\nwhen the work contract ended. Prior to his most recent layoff, Applicant could pay his\nmonthly living expenses, but not his unpaid debts as he lacked sufficient income. He\nhas not purchased a car, new or used, has not taken a vacation, has not purchased any\nbig ticket items, or acquired new credit cards. In 2007, many of his creditors turned his\nunpaid debts over to collection agencies. His parents helped pay his bills during periods\nof unemployment and he received unemployment benefits during some of this time. He\nhas not provided documents showing his income and payment of living expenses during\nhis times of unemployment. The record is not clear as to how he paid his rent, food, and\nother necessary living expenses and his medical bills in 2007.5\nThe SOR identifies 12 debts, totaling $15,750, owed by Applicant. At the hearing,\nhe acknowledged that he had not paid any of these debts. Applicant received settlement\noffers from the creditors in SOR allegations 1.b through 1.e, 1.h through 1.j, and 1.l.\nThree creditors made offers when Applicant was unemployed, the most recent on\nFebruary 5, 2009. Four creditors made offers less than 60 days after he returned to\nwork in April 2008. Applicant accepted none of the settlement offers. I infer that his\nrefusal to accept the settlement offers was because he lacked funds to pay the amount\nof money requested and he decided not to pay old debt with credit cards.6\nIn his answers to interrogatories in June 2008, he indicated he would pay many\nof his debts within 90 days. Instead, in October 2008, Applicant mailed letters to the\ncreditors identified in SOR allegations 1.a through 1.c and 1.h through 1.k. Referencing\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Act, Applicant notified each\ncreditor that he was disputing the creditors debt claim and was requesting validation,\nnot verification, of the debt. Specifically, he requested information on the name of the\n\nAE H through AE M; Tr. 48.\n7\nSOR; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4, supra note 2, at 4; AE O; Tr. 45-46, 56-57, 79-82.  \n8\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 33.\n9\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 27-29; GE 3, supra note 2, at 5; Tr. 107-108.\n10\n4\noriginal creditor, documents showing his debts, agreements to pay and calculation of\nthe amount of debt. He did not deny the debt or refuse to pay. He received no response\nfrom these creditors nor has he established that the creditors received these letters. He\nhas not developed a plan to pay these debts or his other old debts once he returns to\nwork.7\nFinally, Applicant denies that he owes the debts alleged in SOR allegations 1.a,\n1.f and 1.g. He did not recognize these debts. He wrote to the creditor in 1.a, but has\nnot received a response. Without a response, Applicant cannot identify this debt. The\n$180 medical bill is not recognized by Applicant as a medical debt he owes. His medical\nbill are paid. These SOR allegations are generic allegations that have not been plead\nwith specificity and thus, fail to give Applicant notice as to whom he owes these debts.\nThe government has not established a prima facie case as to the debt identified in SOR\nallegations 1.a and 1.g. He provided a receipt, which he believes shows he paid this\ndebt. I find that his receipt is valid verification that he paid the debt in allegation 1.f,\nwhich is found in favor of Applicant.8\n \nOn September 26, 2007, Applicant completed his security clearance application.\nHe answered \u201cno\u201d to the following questions in his e-QIP:9\nSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies\na. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debts?\nb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?\nApplicant denies that he intentionally falsified his answers to these questions. He\nadmits that he was aware of his bills when he completed his security clearance\napplication. He offered no clear explanation for his answer, except to say that in haste,\nhe just provided the wrong information. Applicant did provide information on his E-QIP\nabout an arrest in 2004 and a job termination under unfavorable circumstances in 2007,\nindicating he was willing to provide derogatory information with potentially adverse\nsecurity implications.10\nApplicant provided three letters of recommendation from two friends and a former\nco-worker. All three recommend him for a clearance, stating that he is trustworthy,\n\nAE C; AE D; AE E.\n11\n5\npatriotic, and a person of integrity. All hold clearances and believe that Applicant would\nprotect the nation\u2019s secrets.  \n11\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt when he was unemployed\nand ill. He has been unable to pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in 2007 and 2008. His unpaid debts are recent and frequent.\nThis mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems arose from his medical problems, which led to eight months of unemployment\nbetween January 2007 and April 2008. He returned to work in April 2008, earning $700\na month less in income than he earned at the time he suffered a stroke. Clearly, these\nfactors are beyond his control. Before determining the applicability of this mitigating\ncondition, I must determine if Applicant acted reasonably under the circumstances. For\na period of 15 months, Applicant worked less than 50% of the time. He could not pay his\nbills, He relied upon family and unemployment to pay his basic bills, such as rent,\n\n7\nutilities, food and his car payment. Payment of all his debts by his family was not an\noption. He had no choice but to forgo many of his debt payments. When he returned to\nwork, he earned enough money to pay his basic bills. He did not incur new, unpaid\ndebts. He, however, did not pay his old debts nor did he accept any the offers to settle\nhis debts as he lacked the money to do so. He did not settle these debts by acquiring\nnew debt. Under these circumstances, Applicant acted reasonably. Using new debt to\npay old debt or failing to pay current expenses as a means to pay old debt is not\nreasonable. This mitigating condition applies. However, financial considerations are not\nfully mitigated because Applicant has not made sufficient progress or provided a viable\nplan for delinquent debt resolution. See whole person concept, infra.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling nor has he resolved\nany of his delinquent debts. His letters to seven creditors are not sufficient evidence to\nfully establish a good faith effort to resolve his debts. He has not developed a plan to\nrepay his debts when he returns to work. I conclude these two potentially mitigating\nconditions do not apply.\nFinally, an Applicant may mitigated security concerns under AG \u00b6 20 (e) if \u201cthe\nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is\nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of\nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant notified\nseven creditors that he disputed their claim he owed a debt and requested validation of\nthe debt. He did not refuse to pay the debt. Nonetheless, the creditors failed to respond\nto his request for validation of their debt. He does not deny owing some of these debts,\nbut disputes the actual amount owed. He, however, has not taken sufficient action to\nresolve these debts. This mitigating condition has partial applicability.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n12\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nEven if I were to find the government had established disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a), mitigating condition\n13\nAG 18(f), the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability would apply as the\nallegation of intentional falsification was unsubstantiated.\n8\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted a material fact from his SF-86 when he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Question 28, sections a and b, about his past due debts. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to his honesty. In his response, he denies, however, that he had an intent\nto hide information about his finances. When a falsification allegation is controverted,\nthe government has the burden of proving the omission was deliberate. Proof of an\nomission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record\nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence\nconcerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For\n12\nDC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission,\nconcealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nApplicant denied intentionally leaving out information about his overdue debts.\nEven though he had knowledge of past due debts, Applicant\u2019s failure to answer \u201cyes\u201d\nabout his overdue debts in light of this knowledge is not proof that he intentionally\nfalsified his SF-86. The government has not established that Applicant intended to hide\nhis financial situation from the government. Applicant testified that he was trying to\nmake sure his answers were correct and that he must have unintentionally inputted the\nincorrect information. His testimony reflects that he sought to provide honest and correct\ninformation. He provided other negative information in his SF-86, which supports his\nposition that he did not act intentionally, but carelessly. Guideline E is found in favor of\nApplicant.13\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n9\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern.     \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems became serious when he started missing time from work because of\nmajor health issues. He lost income each time his serious health problems kept him\nfrom working. In November 2007, he took a second job to help pay his bills. Only a\nmonth later, he suffered a stroke, causing him to again miss significant time from work.\nOnce his health improved, he returned to work, but at a lower salary than previously\nearned. \nApplicant disputes seven of the debts listed in the SOR. He, however, has not\ncontacted any of the creditors listed in the SOR to work out a repayment plan once he\nreturns to work nor has he made sufficient efforts to verify if the debts are his or not. In\nhis answers to interrogatories, he said he would pay many of his debts with 90 days of\nreturning to work, but he did not do so. Because he is currently unemployed, he has no\nability to repay his old debts. He has not provided any concrete plan to resolve his debts\nnor has he provided documented information on how he is paying his living expenses\nwhen unemployed. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paidBit is\nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security\nclearance. His debts remain unpaid and he is unemployed. His present circumstances\nraise a security concern because he has no income. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) Based on an\noverall review of the evidence of record, I am unable to conclude that Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns of the government even though he has established\nsome financial mitigating conditions. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct, but has not\nfully mitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations. \n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response dated November 4, 2008, Applicant admitted 8 of the 10\nallegations noted in the SOR and declined a hearing on the record. Department\nCounsel submitted a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), dated January 30, 2009, which\nApplicant received on February 21, 2009. She timely responded to it on or before\nMarch 20, 2009. On March 26, 2009, the Director, DOHA, forwarded the case for\nassignment to an administrative judge for administrative determination. I was assigned\nApril 22, 2009\n\n SOR allegation 1.a.\n      1\n Item 9, Interrogatories, at 2. No specific details are given.\n      2\n See, e.g., SOR allegations 1.h-1.j.\n      3\n SOR allegation 1.a.\n      4\n SOR allegations 1.b-1.d, respectively.\n      5\n Item 4, Statement of Reasons Response, at 1.\n      6\n SOR allegation 1.e.\n      7\n Item 4, at 2.\n      8\n SOR allegations 1.f-1.g; Id.\n      9\n2\nthe case the following day. Based upon a review of the case file, submissions, and\nexhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet her burden regarding the security concerns\nraised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 64-year-old truck driver. She is married and has two adult children.\nPrior to her present career, she retired with distinction after nearly three decades of\nservice in early education. Applicant received her commercial driver\u2019s license nearly\nthree years ago, shortly before starting her current employment.\nA decade ago, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. Her\ndebts were discharged in September 2000.  The only other indication of financial\n1\ntrouble occurred in the summer of 2007, when the family failed to receive pay checks\nfor about 10 weeks.  Devoid of income, many of the accounts at issue became\n2\ndelinquent.3\nThere are few extraneous facts of record. Recent credit reports reflect her 1999\nbankruptcy  and nine delinquent accounts. Applicant admits she owes an in-state\n4\nmedical account with a balance of $50, a state affiliate of a major telecommunications\naccount with a balance of $93, and an in-state medical account with a balance of $25.5\nShe states in her response to the SOR that she is willing to pay these accounts if she\nhad contact information or an address for them.  \n6\nApplicant constructively denies, however, a debt noted as delinquent in the\namount of $3,804. She states she was paying the balance in $50 installments.  The\n7\ncreditor demanded payment in full. Because the entity was rude on the phone, she\nhung up on them.  Apparently, the issue was never revisited and payments ceased.\n8\nFurther, Applicant neither agrees nor disagrees with allegations claiming she owes\nbalances on accounts in the amounts of $4,218 or $3,139 because she does not\nrecognize the accounts.  She presented no evidence of any efforts to establish contact\n9\n\n SOR allegation 1.h; Id. at 2.\n      10\n SOR allegation 1.i.\n      11\n Item 4, at 2.\n      12\n SOR allegation 1.j.\n      13\n Item 4, at 3.\n      14\n Id.\n      15\n Id.\n      16\n Item 9, at 8.\n      17\n3\nwith the creditors or to dispute their entry on her credit report. As well, she believes she\npreviously satisfied an account noted as having a delinquent balance of about $745.10\nRegarding a delinquent auto loan with a balance of approximately $8,686,\nApplicant fell behind on her payments on a car she purchased.  The lender would not\n11\nlet her catch-up on her past due amount in increments, preferring either a lump sum\npayment or the return of the car. \u201cThey took the car and sold it for little or nothing. I\nabsolutely refuse to pay for something I don\u2019t have. Even if I had millions of dollars I\nwouldn\u2019t pay for a car I don\u2019t have. If they would have let me catch up I would have\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to lose the car.\u201d  That debt remains outstanding.\n12\nFinally, it is alleged Applicant owes a balance of approximately $1,352 on a real\nestate mortgage account.  The mortgage was on a time-share property. She writes:\n13\n\u201cWe were supposed to be able to get a vacation anytime we wanted. Well, they lied.\nWe could never get one no matter when we called after paying them for about a year &\n6 mo. I called and told them \u2018I am not paying anymore.\u2019 They have already sold this\nproperty to some other sucker.\u201d  Regarding her failure to pay on this account, she\n14\nnotes: \u201ceven if I had the money I wouldn\u2019t pay this money for something I don\u2019t have.\u201d15\nThe accounts at issue represent the extent of Applicant\u2019s negative financial\nsituation. She believes it is \u201cvery unfair\u201d to think she is \u201ca [security] risk just because of\nthis little bit of money.\u201d  Her net total monthly income is approximately $5,360 and her\n16\ntotal monthly expenses are about $4,000, leaving about $1,200 per month to satisfy a\nmonthly balance of about $1,150 in regular debts, including student loans. In addition,\nApplicant notes she receives about $739 in monthly Social Security payments and $700\nin retirement payments.  Assets are described as a modest savings account and a\n17\n\u201ccar/boat\u201d worth about $1,000.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      18\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      19\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      20\n Id.\n      21\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n18\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n19\n20\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n21\n\n Id.\n      22\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      23\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      24\n W ith regard to the 1999 bankruptcy filing (SOR allegation 1.a), there are insufficient facts of record to\n      25\ndetermine whether that filing and the accrual of that debt are similar in nature to the delinquent debt now at\nissue. Given the number of intervening years between that filing and the delinquency of the debts now at\nissue, the bankruptcy allegation, in and of itself, is of minimal significance and does not raise significant\nsecurity concerns in 2009. \n5\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n22\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n23\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.24\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nHere, Applicant has about nine delinquent accounts noted on her credit report,\nover half of which she admits or acknowledges.  Applicant admits the debts at issue in\n25\nSOR allegations 1.b-1.d. She also admits she stopped paying toward debt balances on\nthe debts noted at SOR allegations 1.e and 1.i because they would not work with her on\nestablishing installment payments. She believes she already paid any sums owed on\nSOR allegation 1.h and 1.j., and does not recognize those accounts noted in SOR\nallegations 1.f or 1.g. Such facts are sufficient to give rise to Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d)\nand FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply. With such\nconditions raised, the burden shifts to Appellant to overcome the case against her and\nmitigate security concerns. \nThere is evidence that a summer without pay checks in 2007 caused some of\nthose accounts to become delinquent. To the extent that downturn in income affected\nher ability to stay timely on her then-current bills, Financial Considerations Mitigating\n\n6\nCondition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies. \nThe unexplained break in income occurred less than two years ago. In choosing\na determination without a hearing, however, facts cannot be discerned as to how or why\nApplicant and/or her husband failed to be paid that summer, whether they were the type\nof facts not likely to repeat themselves in the future, or what efforts they took to honor\ntheir creditors during that time period. Consequently, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) cannot apply. Moreover, based on the very limited\nfacts presented and in the absence of additional facts (e.g., whether Applicant pursed\nfinancial counseling, formally disputed any of the accounts she questioned, or made\ntimely and regular payments on the remaining accounts at issue), none of the other\navailable mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\npublic trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature woman who turned to truck driving as a second career\nafter raising her children and retiring from education. A decade ago, she resorted to\nbankruptcy protection for reasons unstated. Apparently, she dealt with her debts\nsuccessfully between 2000 and 2007.\n\n This explanation is particularly vexing. Applicant tends to believe her summer without a pay check (2007)\n      26\ngave rise to her present situation. This surely would be recent enough, however, to remember the location,\nif not the name, of any health care or telecommunications provider(s) within one\u2019s state of residence. If not,\nthe brief passage of time and one\u2019s presence in-state should make researching contact information a relatively\nsimple task. \n Id.\n      27\n7\nIn the summer of 2007, Applicant, for some unexplained reason, received no pay\nchecks. As a result, some bills became delinquent. Applicant states she is willing to pay\nthe three debts noted in SOR allegations 1.b-1.d, two in-state medical bills and a major\ntelecommunications company balance collectively representing less than $200. She\nexplains, however, that she does not have an address for these creditors and,\ntherefore, cannot satisfy the debts.  In making this explanation, Applicant failed to\n26\ndocument any attempts to locate these in-state creditors through local resources, her\ncredit reports, the credit bureaus, or any other avenue. As for the SOR allegations 1.e\nand 1.i, she ceased making any payments or exploring alternative arrangements when\nthe creditors chose not to accept the nominal monthly payments she proposed.\nRegarding those accounts she does not recognize, there is no documentary evidence\nshowing any action taken by Applicant to address their inclusion on her credit report.\nFor example, there is no indication she formally disputed the accounts noted in SOR\nallegations 1.f and 1.g with either the creditors or with one of the three major credit\nreporting bureaus. As for the two debts she believes she previously satisfied, noted in\nSOR allegations 1.h and 1.j, Applicant submitted no corroborating evidence showing\nher past payment(s), current balances, or other supporting documentation. In short,\nthere is no tangible evidence as to any significant efforts made to address the\ndelinquent debts noted in the SOR and her credit reports.\nDebt, itself, is not necessarily a trigger for security concerns. Security concerns\nare raised in the presence of delinquent debt which has been neglected, mismanaged,\nforgotten, or ignored. Here, the SOR alleges over $22,000 in delinquent debt. Although\nApplicant believes it is \u201cvery unfair\u201d to think she is \u201ca [security] risk just because of this\nlittle bit of money,\u201d  $22,000 is a significant sum. The case law is clear that the ultimate\n27\nburden of persuasion is on the Applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to overcome the prima facie case against her. Here, Applicant\nfailed to submit any tangible evidence substantiating her position on these debts,\ndocumenting her efforts to address these debts alleged, or otherwise reduce the\namount at issue with evidence of payment or formal dispute of an entry. Consequently,\nfinancial considerations security concerns remain. With security concerns regarding her\nfinances remaining, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n8\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 64-year-old married man with three children, ages seven, five, and three. He has been married for 11 years. A previous marriage ended in divorce in 1997. He is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force serving from June 1971 through December 1972 when he was honorably discharged (Item 4 at 10). Applicant is a spacecraft analyst. He earned a bachelor of science degree in 1979. Within the last seven years, Applicant has accrued eight delinquent debts in the approximate amount of $75,000 (Item 3). Two resulted in judgments in 2006 (SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b). All except for SOR subparagraph 1.h, a student loan account, are credit card accounts. SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f were accounts that he cosigned for a friend (Item 3 at 11-12). The friend later defaulted on the accounts. In March 2008, Applicant retained a credit counselor to assist him with a repayment plan (Item 5 at 18). SOR subparagraphs 1.c through 1.f are included in the plan. His assertion that he has been satisfying these SOR debts through the plan is not supported by conclusive, documentary evidence.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR on July 7, 2008, admitted all of the allegations, and\nrequested an administrative determination. On August 18, 2008, department counsel\nprepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant did not reply. On October 23,\n2008, the case was assigned to me. I have reviewed the FORM and have concluded\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to\nclassified information. Clearance is denied.\nDecember 8, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 64-year-old married man with three children, ages seven, five, and\nthree. He has been married for 11 years. A previous marriage ended in divorce in 1997.\nHe is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force serving from June 1971 through December 1972\nwhen he was honorably discharged (Item 4 at 10). Applicant is a spacecraft analyst. He\nearned a bachelor of science degree in 1979.\nWithin the last seven years, Applicant has accrued eight delinquent debts in the\napproximate amount of $75,000 (Item 3). Two resulted in judgments in 2006 (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b). All except for SOR subparagraph 1.h, a student loan\naccount, are credit card accounts. SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f were\naccounts that he cosigned for a friend (Item 3 at 11-12). The friend later defaulted on\nthe accounts.\nIn March 2008, Applicant retained a credit counselor to assist him with a\nrepayment plan (Item 5 at 18). SOR subparagraphs 1.c through 1.f are included in the\nplan. His assertion that he has been satisfying these SOR debts through the plan is not\nsupported by conclusive, documentary evidence. Also, approximately $33,000 of his\ndelinquencies are not included in the plan (SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.g., and 1.h). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \n\n3\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant has accrued approximately $75,000 of delinquent debt. At least one of\nthe debts has been delinquent since February 2005. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d\napply.\nThe delinquencies are still outstanding. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is not applicable.\nApplicant\u2019s friend accrued the majority of the delinquencies after defaulting on\nloans Applicant cosigned. Applicant then became legally responsible for satisfying them.\nUnder these circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not apply.\nApplicant retained a credit counselor, who helped him develop a payment plan.\nThe payment plan only includes four of the eight SOR debts. Moreover, I was unable to\nascertain the extent of his payment progress because Item 6, which appears to\nchronicle the payment history, is arranged in a confusing and disorganized fashion. I\nconclude Applicant\u2019s retention of a credit counselor and initiation of a payment plan\ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem . . ,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply, but have minimal probative\nvalue.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a sensitive position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They are as follows: \n\n4\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination must be an overall commonsense judgment\nbased upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant contends the majority of the delinquencies were accrued by a friend\nwho defaulted on several loans that Applicant had cosigned. This surrounding\ncircumstance does not mitigate the financial concern. As a cosigner, Applicant agreed\nto be responsible for the bills if his friend defaulted. The issues surrounding his friend\u2019s\ndefault are irrelevant. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s decision to cosign multiple loans raises\nquestions about his judgment. Applicant deserves credit for being forthcoming about the\ndelinquencies throughout the adjudicative process. He failed, however, to establish that\nhis delinquent debts are under control. Evaluating this case in the context of the whole\nperson concept, I conclude that the financial considerations remain a security concern.\nClearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She denied the other allegations, including \u00b6 2.a-2.b of the SOR. She provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from high school in June 1979 and attended college for about one year. She has worked for her current employer for 14 years, but she did not require a security clearance for her position (GE 1). Applicant married in 1986 and has two children from the marriage. They are now young adults. She also has two grandchildren who live in her home (Tr. 23). The marriage was quite volatile. Applicant never knew when her husband would bring home his paycheck. There were times when her husband would just disappear for a period of time. She tried to save the marriage by attending counseling. Her husband was an alcoholic and did not make himself amenable to the counseling. In 1994, her husband suddenly left the marriage. The final divorce occurred in 2007 (Tr. 14). Applicant had a difficult transition after separation and divorce.

On June 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on October 28, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November\n18, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 9, 2008. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE 1-3), which were received into the record without\nobjection. Applicant testified in her own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE A-B), without\nobjection. I held the record open until January 9, 2009, so that Applicant could submit\nJanuary 13, 2009\n\n2\nadditional documents. The submission was timely received and marked as AE C.\nDepartment Counsel did not object to the documents. DOHA received the transcript on\nDecember 17, 2008. Based upon a review of the record, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated June 27, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, of the SOR. She denied the other allegations,\nincluding \u00b6 2.a-2.b of the SOR. She provided additional information to support her\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in June 1979 and attended college for about one year. She has worked for\nher current employer for 14 years, but she did not require a security clearance for her\nposition (GE 1).\nApplicant married in 1986 and has two children from the marriage. They are now\nyoung adults. She also has two grandchildren who live in her home (Tr. 23). The\nmarriage was quite volatile. Applicant never knew when her husband would bring home\nhis paycheck. There were times when her husband would just disappear for a period of\ntime. She tried to save the marriage by attending counseling. Her husband was an\nalcoholic and did not make himself amenable to the counseling. In 1994, her husband\nsuddenly left the marriage. The final divorce occurred in 2007 (Tr. 14).\nApplicant had a difficult transition after separation and divorce. Her husband\nprovided occasional support from 1994 until 2000 but at the same time he was taking\nmoney out of her account without her knowledge (Tr. 25). Applicant was trying to\nsupport herself and her two children but the income was reduced from two incomes to\none. Her job paid an hourly rate of $11 an hour which was much less than her\nhusband\u2019s income. She had bills from various credit accounts to pay as well as her\nliving expenses, including the mortgage on her home. As a result, Applicant fell behind\nwith payments on bills. She had a home but she sold it in 2006 and moved to another\nstate for more income. With the sale proceeds ($7,000), she paid approximately $2,400\non delinquent accounts. The accounts were debts that she and her husband accrued\nduring the marriage (Tr 28). \nApplicant incurred moving expenses when she relocated for a new position. The\nremainder of the $7,000 from the sale of the home was spent on the expenses that\nresulted from the move and relocation.\nIn 2007, Applicant fell ill and was hospitalized for a period of time (Tr. 55). She\nreceived short term disability. She also incurred some medical bills from this period of\ntime that she could not pay (Tr. 55).\n\n3\nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts for a total of approximately $32,756 (GE 2\nand 3). Applicant established a debt consolidation plan in 1995. She was paying $400 a\nmonth to take care of her payments, but she could not keep up with the monthly\namount. She contacted another company who advised her to try to settle with the\ncreditors. She was also advised by the company to close her accounts (Tr. 16). Some of\nthe creditors listed are not familiar to her. Applicant inquired about the accounts that\nwere unknown to her. Some of the accounts were old and she has not been able to\ntrack them down. She sought the advice of a group that her employer recommended.\nOn their counsel, she is taking care of the smaller debts at this time. She does not have\nany credit cards at this time. She was also advised by the company not to contact too\nmany creditors because it \u201crestarts\u201d a cycle and it could appear that she is trying to get\nmore credit (Tr. 17).\nApplicant admitted owing six debts listed in the SOR. Applicant has paid the debt\nin \u00b6 1.a for $139. This is a medical account (AE A). She also has several other medical\naccounts listed in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l). These accounts are being resolved through\na payment plan. She pays $25 monthly on a total of $1,400.\nApplicant has four SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, c, n. and o) that relate to AT&T\nwireless accounts. These appear to be duplicates. Applicant disputed that the accounts\nhad not been paid. She contacted AT &T and learned that she is current on her\naccount. She produced documentation that confirms that she has no delinquent debt on\nthe AT&T wireless account (AE C). The other accounts alleged in the SOR have not\nbeen paid but Applicant has contacted them. She plans to settle the larger ones as soon\nas she pays off the smaller ones.  \nApplicant had not looked at her credit report prior to the security investigation. As\nnoted above, she did not recognize some of the debts. She attended a few financial\ncounseling classes in 2006. She was again advised that since so many of her accounts\nare old, she should not attempt to contact the creditors who held large accounts until\nshe was in a position to make a settlement or pay on the debt each month (Tr. 32).\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $2,800 (Tr. 49). After monthly\nexpenses she has a net remainder of approximately $200 (Tr. 51). She is paying on her\ncurrent car loan. She completed financial counseling through work. She also pays on a\nfew other small accounts that are not on the SOR. She had some extra financial\nexpenses due to the hurricane evacuation last year (Tr. 37). \nApplicant completed her first security application on February 6, 2007. In that\napplication she answered \u201cyes\u201d to section 28(a) and (b) which asks for information on\ndebts either 180 days delinquent in the last seven years or 90 days currently delinquent\n(GE 1 ). She listed approximately $1,600 in delinquent debt (GE 1). \nApplicant explained that she completed the application on line at work during her\nlunch period (Tr. 44). She did not have the information on her accounts with her and\nwas overwhelmed. She was candid that she had delinquent debt but was not sure about\n\n4\nthe status of the accounts and answered the questions to the best of her ability. She\nsaid it was a misunderstanding and that she was not familiar with the process. She was\ncredible in his testimony that she had no intent to deceive the government.  \nWhen Applicant was interviewed as part of the security clearance process, she\nexplained her financial status and her delinquencies. She indicated that she did not\nrecognize the names of some of the accounts. She reported to the investigator that in\nher 2006 credit report the debts were not listed. She does not want to file bankruptcy\nbecause she wants to pay her debts (Tr. 47).\nApplicant conducts herself in a professional and trustworthy manner. Her current\nsupervisor recommends her for a security clearance based on her performance,\npersonal conduct, and professional conduct in the workplace (AE) B. She performs her\nduties in a timely manner with the highest integrity. She pushes forward for new\nchallenges to meet customer demands. Applicant\u2019s program manager describes\nApplicant as a kind and thoughtful person who consistently demonstrates high\nstandards and ethic in her actions with others. She leads a team and provides\nexceptional work to the government customer. Applicant is rated as a very dependable,\npositive, and competent professional. She is recommended for a security clearance by\nall her managers.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts\nduring her marriage and was unable to meet her financial obligations from 1994 until the\npresent time. Her credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\n\n6\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose when her husband left the marriage in 1994. Her husband also\ntook money from her account without her knowledge. Her income was much less than\nher husband\u2019s and she had difficulty supporting herself and her two children. She\nestablished a debt consolidation plan in 1994 but she could not keep up with the\npayments. She sought financial guidance and counseling. While those circumstances\nmay have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. She paid several\nsmaller debts in the SOR and intends to repay the larger ones as soon as she can. She\nhas not been able to settle some of them due to the large amount of money that is\nrequired for the settlement. Her conduct over the last six months with her creditors\nremoves security concerns or doubts about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and\ngood judgment. This potentially mitigating condition applies.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant experienced\nseparation and divorce. She lives within her means. She supported her family with an\nincome that was much reduced. She was ill for a period of time. Applicant tried to\nconsolidate her debts as early as 1994. She could not keep up with the payment due to\nhigh interest charges. She was as aggressive as she could in initially addressing or\nresolving her delinquent debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant attended financial counseling though her work\ncompany. She investigated her credit report to track down unknown debts. She has paid\nsome debts. I find her efforts are sufficient to carry her burden in this case. I conclude\nthese potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant provided\ndocumentation concerning the duplicate AT&T accounts. \n\n7\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed her 2007 security application, she\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to the question about any debts that were 90 or 180 days delinquent.\nShe listed $1,600 in  debt and explained that she did not have any paperwork with her. I\nfound her credible. The allegation of falsification is unsubstantiated. I do not find that\nshe deliberately provided false information on her SF 86 in 2007.\nThus, Applicant\u2019s allegation of deliberate omission is mitigated under AG 17(f)\n\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6\n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. \nThrough no fault of her own, Applicant\u2019s marriage created havoc with her\nfinancial situation beginning in approximately 1994. Her husband disappeared at times\nand did not help support Applicant and her two children. Applicant tried to keep the\nmarriage together but despite counseling was unable to do so. Her husband left the\nmarriage in 1994 and also took money from her accounts without her knowledge. She\nwas working and continued to do so but at a much lower rate of pay. She supported her\ntwo children. She maintained them in the family home. She paid the mortgage and daily\nexpenses. She acted responsibly after her husband left her in 1994 and established a\ndebt consolidation program. However, she could not maintain that program. She had\nlimited resources and made decisions which provided her family with their basic needs.\nShe sought financial counseling and heeded the advice of the company. She was told to\npay smaller debts first and to pay the larger ones later. She tried to settle some\naccounts but did not have the requisite amount to do so. She decided not to file\nbankruptcy because she wants to pay her debts.\nShe moved to another location to improve her pay. She sold her house and used\npart of the proceeds to pay her delinquent debts. She lives within her means. She had\nan illness about a year ago which added to her debt. She is paying the medical\naccounts. \nApplicant\u2019s acquisition of debt was not the result of poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Based on the facts\nregarding her lifestyle and husband\u2019s abandonment, there is no indication that her debt\nraises questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, or ability to protect classified\ninformation. Although she still has $32,000 in debt, she has made appropriate strides to\naddress that debt and instituted organized repayments on some accounts. In light of\nthese financial considerations and the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, I find that Applicant has\nmitigated financial considerations security concerns.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from under the financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d-o:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On November 18, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Appellant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about December 19, 2008, and requested a \nhearing.  DOHA assigned the case to me on February 27, 2009, and issued a Notice of \nJune 23, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nHearing on April 28, 2009. The case was heard on May 12, 2009, as scheduled.  \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through G into \nevidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until \nMay 27, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. On May \n26, 2009, Applicant submitted exhibits that I marked as AE H through M, and admitted \ninto the record without objection by the Government.

He denied the allegations contained in Paragraph 2 of the \nSOR.  His admissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old and married three times. He has two children from his \nfirst marriage. He was married from December 2001 to August 2007 to his second wife. \nThey do not have children. He married his present wife in November 2008 and has two \nstep-children. He enlisted in the U. S. Army in June 1988 and was medically discharged \nin February 2001 due to an injury. He was a staff sergeant (E-6) and taught nuclear, \nbiological and chemical warfare to the soldiers. (Tr. 21-22)   \n \n \nAfter leaving the Army, Applicant was unemployed for a few months. He then \nworked for a department store and other private companies before beginning his current \ncivilian position in July 2004 with a battle command training program for the Army.  He \nis a computer system\u2019s administrator.  He has held a Secret security clearance for the \nlast five years. Applicant\u2019s program director supports his request for a security \nclearance. He wrote, Applicant \u201cis a solid, strong employee; one that I count on to \nassume the responsibility for the hard projects. He has consistently demonstrated his \nreliability in the context of this contract for at least the six years that I have been in \ncharge. . . . As for his trustfulness and honesty, it is unquestionable.\u201d (AE B) He is \naware of Government\u2019s security concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s finances. Two other \ncolleagues wrote letters of recommendation on his behalf. (AE C and D)  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began while married to his second wife. During the \nmarriage, he traveled for extended periods of time for work and did not monitor the \nfamily finances. For example, he traveled for approximately 170-180 days annually for a \ncouple years. (Tr. 74; 78) While gone, he thought his wife was managing the bills and \ndid not know that she was not paying them. In May 2007, his wife moved out of the \nhouse along with their furnishings. On August 2, 2007, the court entered a final divorce \ndecree. According to the property settlement agreement, he agreed to assume about \n$40,000 of marital debt in exchange for retaining the marital residence. (AE M) Prior to \nthe entry of the decree, he paid $2,800 in July 2007 for outstanding property taxes for \n2004, 2005 and 2006 that he learned were delinquent. (AE A and L) He also agreed to \npay his former wife\u2019s car insurance for six months and her health insurance for one year \nafter the divorce. (GE 2 at 4) In March 2008, he completed making payments on a \n\n \n \n \n \n3\ngarnishment for $2,519 that was ordered in December 2007 for a marital debt he \nassumed. (GE 2 at 8) \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR), dated November 13, 2007 and January \n29, 2009, the SOR alleges eight debts, totaling about $44,519 that became delinquent \nbetween December 2005 and November 2007. The status of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $30,222 debt owed to a creditor for personal loan. The \noriginal loan was for $21,000. He has been unable to resolve it because the \ncreditor wants a lump sum payment that he cannot afford at this time. (Tr. 25; \n50; GE 2 at 10) This is a marital debt that he assumed in the property \nsettlement. (AE M) \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a $9,637 debt owed to car company on a repossessed \nvehicle. His lawyer is resolving the debt. He anticipates paying $325 per \nmonth until the debt is paid. (Tr. 26, 52; AE J) This is a marital debt that he \nassumed in the property settlement. (AE M) \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $957 debt owed to a department store. He paid the debt \non March 16, 2009. This is a marital debt that he assumed. (Tr. 26; AE E and \nM) \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $20 medical debt that he paid electronically on May 10, \n2009. (Tr. 29)  \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $504 debt owed to a cellular telephone company. He \npaid it on April 23, 2009. This is a marital debt that he assumed. (Tr. 29-30; \nAE F and M)  \n \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a $1,361 debt owed to a telephone company. He \ntelephoned the listed creditor, who is unable to locate the account. It remains \nunresolved.1 (Tr. 30-31; AE H and M) \n \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a $1,718 debt owed to his mortgage company. He has \npaid $850 or more from February 2008 to April 2009 to make up any deficits. \nIt will be current by January 2010. (Tr. 31-32; AE L; GE 4 at 3) \n \n8. SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a $100 medical debt. He paid it on March 18, 2009. (Tr. \n32; AE G) \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant has resolved five of the eight debts and his lawyer is \nresolving another debt. He is investigating one debt and is intending to resolve the \nlargest debt as funds become available.  \n \n  \n                                            \n1This debt does not appear on either the November 2007 or January 2009 CBR. (GE 3 and 4)  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $4,911, and includes his wife\u2019s unemployment \nand child support. His monthly expenses are $2,444. His payments on his financial \nobligations total $1,832, and include a projected $325 monthly payment on the debt \nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.b, leaving approximately $634 at the end of the month. (AE H) He \nanticipates receiving a monthly $584 disability payment through the Veteran\u2019s \nAdministration in the coming months that he will be able to use for further debt \nreduction. (Tr. 44)  \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant submitted an e-QIP. In response to \u201cSection 28: Your \nFinancial Delinquencies. a. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent \non any debt(s),\u201d he answered \u201cno.\u201d In response to Section 28: Your Financial \nDelinquencies. b. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts(s),\u201d he \nanswered \u201cno.\u201d When he completed the e-QIP, he knew he had debts, but did not \nbelieve they were delinquent three to six months. His ex-wife had been managing the \nhousehold bills during their marriage and did not inform him of the delinquencies. (Tr. \n35)  He thinks she may have been saving money in anticipation of her departure instead \nof paying their bills. (Tr. 60) He did not intentionally attempt to defraud the Government. \n(Tr. 36) He disclosed a 1986 felony conviction in the e-QIP. (GE 1 at 32) \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly and forthrightly. He is aware of his obligations, but has \nnot had enough money to pay all of the debts at one time since the divorce.  He is \nattempting to pay them one at a time or as his budget permits. (Tr. 85) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the Financial Considerations guideline is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and maybe \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt in \nDecember 2005 while married to his second wife and as part of their divorce. Those \ndebts continued to accrue through November 2007. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant=s financial problems arose around December 2005 and continue to be \nunresolved into 2009; thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply because the problems have been \nongoing for several years.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems are attributable to his second \nmarriage and their August 2007 divorce agreement in which he assumed a significant \nportion of marital debts. Those conditions were \u201cbeyond his control.\u201d There is some \nevidence that after learning of the debts in the summer of 2007 he took steps to begin \nmanaging his obligations. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) has partial application.  He has not sought \ncredit counseling to-date, but has been addressing some of the delinquent debts, such \nthat there are \u201cindications that the problem is being resolved,\u201d warranting a limited \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(c). He has paid five debts, is negotiating the resolution of \nanother, and has attempted to address the remaining two. His action, along with a \nbudget that takes into account the delinquent debt, is evidence of a good-faith effort to \n\u201crepay or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d and triggers a partial application of AG \u00b6 20(d). \nThe record evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) or AG \u00b6 \n20(f). \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the Personal Conduct guideline is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b that Applicant falsified answers \nto two questions on his e-QIP, regarding disclosure of debts more than 90 or 180 days \ndelinquent. The Government contended that his omissions of delinquent debts may \nraise a security concern and be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(a):  \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that he intentionally omitted information about his delinquent \ndebts.   \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the \nburden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \nWhen completing his e-QIP, Applicant knew that he had some debts, but did not \nrealize the scope of those delinquencies or the length of time they had been outstanding \nbecause his former wife managed the household budget and never informed him of the \noutstanding debts. Since his separation from her, he has learned of his financial \nproblems and promptly paid outstanding property taxes, and later a marital debt through \na garnishment. Given the actions he has taken to address his obligations and his \ntruthful disclosure of a 1986 criminal conviction, I find his explanation for not disclosing \ndelinquent debts credible. The omission of the information was not intentional. Hence, \nthe evidence does not establish deliberate falsification. This Guideline is found in his \nfavor. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 44-year-old man, who \nhad a thirteen-year career with the U.S. Army before becoming injured and medically \ndischarged. Since 2004, he has worked for a federal employer supporting the Army. He \nbegan accruing financial delinquencies during his second marriage, unbeknownst to \nhim. While in the divorce process in the summer of 2007, he started paying some of his \noutstanding bills. In accordance with an August 2007 divorce decree, he assumed about \n$40,000 of marital debt. Since then, he has paid or is in the process of resolving about \n$13,000 of delinquent debts listed in the SOR. He has paid an additional $5,300 of other \nmarital debts, plus covered his former wife\u2019s car and health insurance for a period of \ntime. He intends to continue resolving the remaining outstanding debt and has a \ndetailed budget that provides money to do so. Should his wife obtain employment, he \nwill have additional monies available in the budget. His supervisor and wife are aware of \nthis problem, eliminating a potential for pressure of coercion. He acknowledges his \nfinancial obligations and the potential negative effect it can have on his employment.  \nAfter listening to him, I find that it is unlikely that similar problems will recur in the future \nor that he will fail to resolve his current obligations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations and \npersonal conduct.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in Paragraph 1 of the SOR. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he in financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to obtain funds. The Applicant served about 13 years in the military. He first was an enlisted man in the Marine Corps for seven years, then served for five years as a warrant officer pilot in the Army.

On December 15, 2008,\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed security concerns under Guideline F stating why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be denied or revoked. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush\n\n2\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 28, 2009, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. Pursuant to Paragraph E3.1.7 of the Additional Procedural\nGuidance at Enclosure 3 of the Directive, Department Counsel requested that a hearing\nbe held in this case. (Transcript at 9.) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\nMarch 3, 2009. This case was assigned to me on March 5, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on April 8, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 19,\n2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received\nwithout objection. The Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through E, also without objection. The record was left open at the Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for the submission of additional documentation. The Applicant submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit F on or about June 2, 2009. This exhibit was also received without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on May 27, 2009. The record\nclosed on June 2, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 35, married but separated, and is a high school graduate. He\nseeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in Paragraph 1 of the\nSOR. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he\nin financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to obtain\nfunds.\nThe Applicant served about 13 years in the military. He first was an enlisted man\nin the Marine Corps for seven years, then served for five years as a warrant officer pilot\nin the Army. He received a medical discharge in 2005 for service connected, non-\ncombat, injuries. (Transcript at 33-35.) \nThe Applicant left active duty in May 2005, very soon after his medical discharge\nwas approved. By the Applicant\u2019s own admission, he did not have sufficient time to\nprepare himself or his family for his return to civilian life, which included moving from an\noverseas location back to the United States.  (Transcript at 35-36.)\nOnce he returned to the United States in May 2005, the Applicant was unable to\nobtain consistent full-time employment until February 2007. At that time he began\nworking for his current employer. He has been employed by this company continually\nsince that time. (Transcript at 36-38; Government Exhibit 1 at Section 11, and Exhibit 2.)\n\nSee Transcript at 42-43.\n1\n3\nSubparagraph 1.a. concerns the Applicant filing for bankruptcy. By the summer\nof 2008, the Applicant reached a financial state where he could examine all of his\noptions regarding his past due debt.  He testified:\nI initially wanted to do credit counseling to see if I could fix myself\nthat way, my wife and I. It wasn\u2019t \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t have worked, so we went\nthrough some counseling prior to bankruptcy and it looked like that was\nthe avenue. And I actually took a few more months trying to make that\ndecision before I did it. I did it. And it was discharged in February [2009].\n(Transcript at 38.)1\nThe available records show that the Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in\nNovember 2008. (Government Exhibit 6 at 1.) He was granted a discharge on February\n18, 2009. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 2.) The Applicant submitted the Schedule F -\nCreditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims from his bankruptcy petition.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 3-6.) The debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.b through 1.y. of\nthe SOR were included in the schedule. These debts have been discharged and the\nApplicant no longer has responsibility for them.\nThe Applicant also submitted the Schedule E - Creditors Holding Secured\nNonpriority Claims. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 1-2.) The debts alleged in subparagraphs\n1.z. and 1.aa. are included on this schedule.  They are nondischargeable in bankruptcy.\nThe Applicant submitted evidence that these governmental claims are being paid\nthrough application of his tax refunds from the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. (Transcript\nat 58-61; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.)  \nThe debts set forth in subparagraphs 1.bb. and 1.cc. are not included in the\nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition.  Both debts precede the date of the petition and their\nabsence appears to be an oversight.  Under bankruptcy rules, even though these debts\nare not included in the schedules, as unsecured nonpriority debts they are still\ndischarged. (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727.) (Transcript at 44, 56-57.)\nThe Applicant testified that he is able to maintain payments on his current debts\nnow that he has been discharged in bankruptcy. This includes his child support\nresponsibilities. He has taken credit counseling, and is working with a certified public\naccountant to get his financial situation in order. (Transcript at 50-51; Government\nExhibit 2 at 12.) \nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted a written recommendation from his supervisor. This\nperson describes the Applicant as a person of \u201cIntegrity and sound judgment.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant has had financial difficulties (Guideline F). The Applicant, on\nthe other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:     \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns.  The Applicant failed to pay a series of debts for a period of years.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Mitigating Condition \u00b6 20(a) states that the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment . . ., or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s debt situation was seriously impacted by his\n\n6\nmedical discharge from the Army, and the period of underemployment that followed it.\nThe evidence raises these mitigating conditions. \nThe Applicant\u2019s debts have been discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  This\nconduct is mitigating under two conditions. He has obtained the required credit\ncounseling, and is working with a certified public accountant on a spending plan.\nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(c) applies, which states that it is mitigating where \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem . . . .\u201d In addition, under the facts of\nthis case, the bankruptcy shows that \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d under \u00b6 20(d). \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a) in making such a determination: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, in particular the Applicant allowing\nthese debts to lie fallow for several years, his medical discharge from the Army, which\nprevented him from properly preparing to enter the civilian workforce, his decision to file\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and his ability to maintain his current debts. Three of the\nfactors have the most impact on this case.  First, I find that there is the \u201cpresence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under\nAG \u00b6 2(a)(6). The Applicant has shown that his failure to pay these debts was a\ntemporary situation that has been corrected. Under the particular facts of this case,\nthere is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth\nin AG \u00b6 2(a)(8). Finally, the evidence does not show a \u201clikelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence\u201d of the conduct as discussed in AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance. Accordingly, the\n\n7\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.cc:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n  \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by deleting in Paragraph 2.a \n\u201c1.d,\u201d and adding in its place \u201c1.e,\u201d to allege alcohol was a contributing factor in the five \nincidents listed in Paragraph 1.  Applicant had no objection to the motion.  I granted the \nmotion. (Tr. 94, 95) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e of the SOR. He also provided additional information to \nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 25 years old, married with two children, and works for a defense \ncontractor. He has a high school degree, and wants to take college business courses.  \nApplicant has been promoted since he started working at the company.  With a security \nclearance, Applicant\u2019s promotion and other work opportunities increase at his company.  \nHe does not have a security clearance now.  He started work with his employer in \nJanuary 2003.  He married the mother of his two children in March 2008. (Tr. 18, 26-38; \nExhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant had his first drink of alcohol at the age of 15.  It made him sick.  He \nstopped drinking until the age of 17.  He partied with high school friends, and became \nintoxicated on weekends.  He does not associate with those high school friends any \nmore, instead spending time with his wife. He no longer drinks to the point of \nintoxication, but only to get a \u201cbuzz.\u201d His drinking is occasional, usually in a social \nsetting.  His last intoxication was at his wedding in March 2008.  Applicant also admitted \nhe has a temper. When he drinks, his temper rises faster than normal, and he gets very \nupset. Additionally, Applicant becomes more talkative when he drinks. All of the \nincidents listed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR involved alcohol consumption. Applicant has \nnot attended any alcohol awareness classes since 2002 when he attended the class as \npart of his court sentence in that incident. The class was two or three times per week for \ntwo weeks.  He has not attended any Alcoholics Anonymous sessions.  (Tr. 25, 41-44, \n51, 68-76, 82)  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested May 11, 2002, while at a party with friends.  He was \nready to depart, and went to his friend\u2019s truck to sit and wait for him to leave.  He had \n\n \n3 \n \n \nconsumed eight or nine beers in a four or five hour period.  Applicant fell asleep in the \npassenger seat.  Meanwhile, a fight broke out and the police were called.  The police \nfound Applicant asleep, opened the truck door, and he fell out onto the ground.  He \nsprang up in an aggressive manner.  His attitude got him thrown to the ground by the \npolice, and forcibly restrained while transported to the local jail.  He was bruised in the \naltercation with police, and had medical tests several days later when he felt ill.  \nApplicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DUI), obstructing justice and \ndestroying evidence, aggravated assault on a police officer, and illegal consumption of \nalcohol by a minor.  He was found guilty of reckless driving, and sentenced to one year \ncourt supervision, attendance at a DUI school for alcohol awareness, 15 hours of public \nservice, and fined $1,917.  He paid the fine and served the time.  Applicant lessened his \nalcohol consumption for a while after taking the DUI class. (Tr. 19-21, 44-51; Exhibit 2) \n \n \nApplicant and his girlfriend, now his wife, were involved in an incident on August \n16, 2003.  Applicant had three or four beers at a party they attended that night. His \ngirlfriend and one of her friends got into an altercation with other women at the party.  \nHis girlfriend and her friend got eggs and threw them at the car belonging to the girls \nwith whom they had a dispute.  The charge was Knowingly Damaging Property valued \nat less than $300.  He accepted the blame, even though his girlfriend committed the \nwrongful acts.  He paid $230 restitution. (Tr. 22, 23, 52, 53; Exhibits 1 and 2) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in another state for being drunk and disorderly on July 20, \n2004.  Applicant claims he and a friend had been in a bar talking and drinking when \npolice stopped them as they walked back to their hotel.  The police were investigating \nreports of destruction of property.  Applicant had a bad attitude toward police since the \nMay 11, 2002, arrest, and he had a quick temper.  The situation deteriorated and the \npolice took Applicant into the station for questioning, handcuffing and booking him, and \ncharged him with being drunk and disorderly.  He was fined $855 and costs, of which \n$350 was suspended.  Applicant drank several beers and shots of alcohol prior to the \narrest.  He admits he was intoxicated that night.  (Tr. 53-62; Exhibits 1 and 2) \n \n \nOn March 13, 2005, Applicant was arrested in a town near his hometown on \ncharges of failure to reduce speed, leaving the scene of an accident, and improper turn \nsignal usage.  He was found of guilty of failure to reduce speed, and sentenced to 90 \ndays of supervision and fined $344.  This incident was a hit and run by Applicant.  He \ncharacterized the damage to the rear end of another car as minimal and under $1,000.  \nApplicant made a turn, hit a wet spot on the road, spun out, and nicked the bumper of \nanother car.  Applicant left the scene of the accident.  Alcohol was not involved in this \nincident.  (Tr. 70-72, 80; Exhibits 1 and 2) \n \n \nOn July 29, 2005, the police arrested Applicant in the same town on disorderly \nconduct charges.  Applicant does not recall this incident, but provided evidence of the \noffense in the interrogatories he answered on May 20, 2008.  The fine paid was $119, \nand supervision was ordered.  Alcohol was involved in this incident. (Tr. 62-70; Exhibits \n1 and 2)   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s next incident with law enforcement officials occurred on July 6, 2006, \nwhen he punched a hole in his garage wall.  He was upset after an incident in a bar \nearlier in the evening.  He consumed four or five beers that evening, he estimates. His \ngirlfriend, now his wife, called police when she heard the noise, and did not realize it \nwas made by Applicant.  His girlfriend did not appear in court, and the charge was \ndropped.  Applicant has not had any involvement with the police since 2006.  Applicant \nrealizes he was not being wise in his conduct between 2002 and 2006, and his new \nfamily has made him think about what he does so he can be a role model for his \ndaughters.  Applicant has never attended any alcohol awareness programs after the \n2002 sessions.  He has never attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).  He does not \nconsider his alcohol use to be a problem. (Tr. 23, 63, 72, 73, 82, 84, 86; Exhibits 1, 2)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15,\u201dThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n5 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and, \n \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \n \n \nApplicant has five involvements with police authorities between 2002 and 2006.  \nAll involved alcohol use by Applicant, leading to his temper flaring, disorderly conduct \ncharges and other charges, fines and various dispositions of these charges.  He has a \nsixth charge involving a hit and run incident in which his careless driving led to damage \non another person\u2019s car.  Both disqualifications apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides five conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement; and, \n \n(e) potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may not be \nmitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretaries \nof the Military Departments or designee; or the Directors of Washington \nHeadquarters Services (WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), \nNational Security Agency (NSA), Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) or designee, has granted a waiver. \n  \n \nOf these five potentially mitigating conditions, only AG \u00b6 32 (d) might apply.  \nApplicant has a good work record, according to him.  Two years have passed in which \nhe has not been arrested.  He married his girlfriend, who is the mother of his two \ndaughters, forcing him to reassess his past behavior as he tries to be a role model for \nhis children.  He wants to enroll in college night courses to obtain a business degree, \nbut has not done so yet.  When compared to the frequency of his criminal conduct in the \npast, I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions have limited application.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying.  Of these seven conditions, two have applicability to Applicant: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 (a) and (c) are relevant.  Applicant\u2019s five arrests away from work \nbetween 2002 and 2006 involve disturbing the peace, property damage, and arrests by \npolice authorities.  Alcohol was an important factor in each incident.  If Applicant did not \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconsume alcohol at those times, the incidents might not have occurred.  His habitual \nconsumption of alcohol impaired his judgment on these occasions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nOf these mitigating conditions, only AG \u00b6 23 (b) might be applicable in a limited \nmanner.  Applicant continues to consume alcohol, though on fewer occasions and only \nto get a \u201cbuzz.\u201d  Applicant admitted alcohol played a role in each of the incidents and is \ntrying to establish a pattern of responsible use.  However, he has not provided evidence \nof objective and professional actions to overcome whatever alcohol problem he has.  \nNor has he demonstrated enough time passage to show he is responsibly consuming \nalcohol.  His admissions that he still imbibes alcohol to the ill-defined \u201cbuzz\u201d level are \nnot persuasive that his drinking is under control.   \n  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying.  Of these seven conditions, two have applicability to Applicant: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and, \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \n \nApplicant has criminal conduct problems from 2002 to the 2006, and alcohol \nconsumption problems continuing to the present.  Not only did the alcohol cause five \ninvolvements with police authorities, but it aggravates his temper to give it a hair-trigger \nstart element, and makes him more loquacious.  Persons who have access to classified \ninformation must be reliable, trustworthy, and able to protect classified information.  \nThose persons must also have self-discipline and integrity if they are to be trusted with \nclassified information. Applicant has not demonstrated the maturity and responsibility \nneeded for that access.  His alcohol consumption led to demonstrable problems with \nlaw enforcement officials, but of equal concern is his temper and loquacity while \nimbibing alcohol.  These characteristics of Applicant after imbibing alcohol could \nadversely affect his personal, professional and community standing. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nConsidering all these mitigating conditions, there is not one that applies to \nApplicant.  The offenses were not minor nor has sufficient time passed since they \noccurred that such conduct is unlikely to recur, as required under AG \u00b617 (c).  There are \nno counseling records evident, nor positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors which caused his past behavior, nor is there sufficient \nevidence to show such conduct will not recur to warrant the application of AG \u00b6 17 (d). \nHis marriage and reduced alcohol consumption, though difficult to quantify in \ncomparison to his prior use between 2002 and 2006, are not positive steps objectively \nidentified to show he reduced his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, \nas required under AG \u00b617 (e).   \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant was 20 years old when \nthe first arrest occurred, and 24 when the last one occurred.  He committed six serious \noffenses in four years, all involving alcohol lubricating his temper and tongue.   The only \npermanent behavioral changes are the birth of his second child and his marriage this \nyear to the mother of his two children.  Despite those facts, Applicant continues to drink \nalcohol, although on fewer occasions. Without documentation of professional \nrehabilitation, addressing the underlying reasons for his consumption of alcohol and the \nsubsequent consequences, there is a substantial likelihood of recurrence of the same \nalcohol-induced situations. His temper and loquacious nature are detriments to \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct, \nalcohol consumption, and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 57 years old and at the time he submitted his e-QIP was serving as the President and Chief Operating Officer of a native Corporation. He had served as President for about seven years. He left his position voluntarily because of disagreements with members of the Board of Director's (Gov. X 5 at 7). He is married and has children but the number of children is not listed in the file. He has not had formal education since high school (Gov. X 4 and 5). Applicant admitted in an affidavit to security investigators and in response to Interrogatories that he used marijuana in a social setting with friends in a remote village on a regular basis about two or three times a week from 1970 until 2004. He never purchased the marijuana but used it as supplied by others. He stopped using the drug in 2004 because it was not worth it anymore and it impacted the cohesion of his family. His family is now living a better lifestyle. He never was dependent on the drug nor had he ever received counseling or treatment for his marijuana use. He never was in legal trouble over his use of marijuana. He does not intend to use marijuana in the future unless his personal circumstances change to allow it (Gov X 5 and 6).

On December 24, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \n(Gov X 1)  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 13, 2009.  He admitted all the \nallegations, and elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing (Gov X 3).  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on \nJanuary 30, 2009.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM), and \nwas provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nApril 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nor mitigate the security concerns by March 17, 2009.  He did not provide additional \ninformation.  The case was assigned to me on April 14, 2009.  Based upon a review of \nthe case file and the pleadings, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under Guidelines H and E.  I thoroughly \nand carefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings.  I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \nApplicant is 57 years old and at the time he submitted his e-QIP was serving as \nthe President and Chief Operating Officer of a native Corporation.  He had served as \nPresident for about seven years.  He left his position voluntarily because of \ndisagreements with members of the Board of Director's (Gov. X 5 at 7).   He is married \nand has children but the number of children is not listed in the file.  He has not had \nformal education since high school (Gov. X 4 and 5).   \n \n \nApplicant admitted in an affidavit to security investigators and in response to \nInterrogatories that he used marijuana in a social setting with friends in a remote village \non a regular basis about two or three times a week from 1970 until 2004.  He never \npurchased the marijuana but used it as supplied by others.  He stopped using the drug \nin 2004 because it was not worth it anymore and it impacted the cohesion of his family. \nHis family is now living a better lifestyle.  He never was dependent on the drug nor had \nhe ever received counseling or treatment for his marijuana use.  He never was in legal \ntrouble over his use of marijuana.  He does not intend to use marijuana in the future \nunless his personal circumstances change to allow it (Gov X 5 and 6). \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana after being granted a security \nclearance on or about December 15, 2000.  Applicant signed his most recent request \nfor security clearance (e-QIP) on January 30, 2007.  He responded \"NO\" to questions \n24a and 24b which asked if he had used illegal drugs since he was 16 or in the last \nseven years, and if he used illegal drugs while possessing a security clearance.  He \nalso answered \"NO\" to question 26 asking if the government had ever investigated him \nfor a security clearance.  Since he admitted to using marijuana after being granted a \nsecurity clearance, he must have been investigated for a security clearance.  In a \nprevious security clearance application dated January 20, 2001, he also answered \"NO\" \nto question 27 on that request which asked if he had used illegal drugs since age 16 or \nin the last seven years.  He had been using marijuana since 1970 and still using \nmarijuana at the time he answered this questions.  In response to questions from \nsecurity investigators, Applicant stated he did not think it necessary to include his \nmarijuana use on the January 30, 2007 application since it was only marijuana and he \nstopped using in 2004.  He stated he did not understand the question correctly.  He \nadmitted to falsifying the answers to these questions when responding to the allegations \nin the SOR.   \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Administrative Guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \n\n \n4 \n \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are mood and behavior altering \nsubstances, and include those listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  \nMarijuana is listed in the Act.  Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or the use of a \nlegal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction. (AG \u00b6 24)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted to using marijuana two to three times a week in a social \nsetting for almost 35 years, from 1970 until 2004.  His drug use raises Drug Involvement \nDisqualifying Conditions (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug use); DI DC AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal \ndrug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution); and DI DC AG \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security \nclearance).  He had to possess the marijuana to use it.  He used marijuana until 2004 \nand was granted a security clearance in 2000. \n \n \nI have considered the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) and find \nnone apply.  Applicant admitted using marijuana for an extended period of time.  Even \nthough he stopped using marijuana in 2004, it is recent when compared to 35 years of \nregular marijuana use.  His use of marijuana is therefore recent and frequent.  DI MC \nAG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  \nApplicant notes that he has not used marijuana since 2004.  He states he does not \nintend to use marijuana in the future unless his personal circumstances change to allow \nit.  This is not a clear intent to stop using marijuana.  There is no indication of the \nchanged circumstances that may permit him to use marijuana in the future.  In addition, \nthis stated intent is only recent as opposed to his many years of drug use.  DI MC AG \u00b6 \n26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as; (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation) does \nnot apply because he failed to provide evidence to support the mitigating condition.  \nApplicant repeatedly and regularly used marijuana weekly over four years while holding \na security clearance.  He failed to provide any mitigating evidence for his use of an \nillegal drug while holding a security clearance.  He has not presented sufficient \ninformation to overcome the security concern for his extended use of marijuana.  \nGuideline H is decided against Applicant \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \n\n \n5 \n \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s false answers concerning \nhis use of marijuana and his use while holding a security clearance raises a security \nconcern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (the \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness). \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately failed to answer drug related questions \ncorrectly and accurately on both his January 20, 2001, and January 30, 2007, security \nclearance applications.  While there is a security concern for an omission, concealment, \nor falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the \ngovernment when applying for a security clearance, every omission, concealment, or \ninaccurate statement is not a falsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and \nmaterial.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  Applicant admits he \nknowingly and willfully provided false information on his security clearance application in \nresponse to questions concerning both drug use and drug use while holding a security \nclearance.  An individual completing a security clearance applicant would not admit to \nextended marijuana use.  It is evident that a clear reason for denying access to \nclassified formation is long term extensive drug use, particularly if the individual is \nalready cleared for access to classified information.  I find against Applicant as to \nPersonal Conduct.   \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commons sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.   \n \n \nApplicant has not established that he is trustworthy, reliable, and exercises good \njudgment.  To the contrary, he used marijuana frequently for almost 35 years and then \n\n \n6 \n \nprovided false information about his use on his security clearance applications.  Even \nthough he stated he stopped using marijuana about four years ago, that is a short time \ncompared to his 35 year of use.  He also left the door open to resume using marijuana if \nhis personal circumstances permit his use.  Applicant repeatedly used marijuana while \nalready being trusted with access to classified information.  He provided no evidence to \nconvince ne he should be trusted again.  The record evidence leaves me with questions \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his \ndrug involvement and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On December 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the government\u2019s security concerns \nunder Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and it recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 16, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR on February \n18, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 20, 2009. The case \nwas assigned to another administrative judge on April 2, 2009, and was reassigned to \nme on May 11, 2009, due to caseload considerations. Counsel for Applicant entered his \nnotice of appearance on April 9, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 23, \n2009, scheduling the case for May 19, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through U, which were \nreceived without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on June 3, 2009.  \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a Request for Administrative Notice (Exhibit (Ex.) \nI(A)), requesting that I take administrative notice of the summary of facts contained in \nEx. I(A) as well as those facts in Exs. I through VIII. Without objection from Applicant, I \ntook administrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel, which \npertained to Hong Kong and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Tr. 14-15.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \nHong Kong and the PRC were derived from Exs. I(A), and I through VIII as contained \ninfra under the subheading \u201cHong Kong and the PRC\u201d in this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a., 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.h. with explanations.

The authors of these letters cover a \nwide spectrum of individuals to include a former supervisor, an active duty Air Force \nintelligence officer (in-law), pastor, father\u2019s church friends, senior company managers, \nand college friend. The consistent and overriding sense these letters convey is that \nApplicant is a trustworthy, loyal, hardworking, and honorable person.  \n \nThe senior company managers spoke of the significant contribution Applicant has \nmade to the national defense and of his potential for future service. They also noted that \nApplicant successfully held an interim clearance for four years without incident. They \ncollectively support reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. AE A-K.

AE K-N. \n \n \nHong Kong and the PRC2 \n \nHong Kong became a Special Administrative Region of the PRC on July 1, 1997. \nHong Kong has a population of 6.9 million and 95% of Hong Kong\u2019s population is of \nChinese descent. China has given Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, except the \nPRC has retained responsibility for defense and foreign policy. Recently, China has \ntaken a more active oversight role of Hong Kong\u2019s control of political developments. \n \nThe Hong Kong government generally respects the human rights of its citizens; \nhowever, reported human rights problems include some political restrictions on the \nlegislature\u2019s power, press self-censorship, violence and discrimination against women, \nand restrictions on workers\u2019 rights to organize and bargain collectively. \n \nThe PRC\u2019s Military Intelligence Department, First Bureau, is responsible for \ncollecting military information about the U.S. The PRC\u2019s Ministry of State Security is the \n\u201cpreeminent civilian intelligence collection agency in China,\u201d and maintains intelligence \noperations in Hong Kong, and Macau, through a bureau utilizing PRC nationals with \nHong Kong or Macau connections. \n \nChina has an authoritarian, Communist government. China has a poor human \nrights record, suppresses political dissent, and practices arbitrary arrest and detention, \nforced confessions, torture, and other prisoner mistreatment. \n \nChina is a nuclear power with a large Army. China is geographically vast, and \nhas a population of over one billion people. It has significant resources, and an \n \n \n2The contents of this section are taken in whole or in part from Exs.

China aggressively \ncompetes with the United States in many areas. PRC\u2019s competitive relationship with the \nUnited States exacerbates the risk posed by Applicant\u2019s Hong Kong connections.   \n \n \nChina actively collects military, economic, and proprietary industrial information \nabout the United States because of the following circumstances: (1) its position as a \nglobal superpower; (2) its military, political, and economic investments in the Pacific Rim \nand Asia; (3) its leading role in development of advanced technology that China desires \nfor economic growth; and (4) China considers the large number of Americans of \nChinese ancestry as intelligence targets. China\u2019s active intelligence gathering programs \nfocus on sensitive and protected U.S. technologies.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontact with his parents and to a lesser extent with his younger brother when he is in \nHong Kong during summer breaks. These close relationships create a potential risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion meriting a close \nexamination of all circumstances. \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions as a result of Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented. The \ngovernment established that Applicant\u2019s parents currently are residents of Hong Kong, \nand that Applicant maintains frequent contact with them by e-mail and travel. The \nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \n \n \nTwo foreign influence mitigating conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nApplying common sense and life experience, there is a rebuttable presumption \nthat a person has ties of affection for, and/or obligation to, his immediate family. ISCR \nCase No. 04-07766 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. \nBd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant demonstrated the indicia of ties of affection for/and or \nobligation to his parents and brother by telephone and e-mail contact as well as his \ntravel to Hong Kong and the PRC in December 2006 to January 2007.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant\u2019s parents are currently working for a non-profit Christian organization \nregistered in Hong Kong and with the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs of \nthe PRC. As such, their work is recognized by the local Chinese government. \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother\u2019s time in Hong Kong is limited to summer break when not \nattending college. Applicant\u2019s parents have not had any conflicts with the local Chinese \ngovernment since their arrival in Hong Kong in 2004. Applicant\u2019s contact with his \npaternal aunt and uncle is very limited. Their presence in Hong Kong, which is now part \nof the PRC, and Applicant\u2019s infrequent foreign travel, creates concerns under this \nGuideline. As such, the burden shifted to Applicant to show that the presence of his \nrelatives in Hong Kong and his travel there do not create security risks.  \n \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved in the case, and the intelligence-\ngathering history of that government are important evidence that provides context for all \nthe other evidence of the record . . .\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-0776 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSept. 26, 2006); see also ISCR Case No. 02-07772 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2003). As \nnoted supra under the subheading \u201cHong Kong and the PRC,\u201d Hong Kong is a part of \nthe PRC, which is ruled by a communist government that actively engages in \nintelligence gathering against the U.S. The PRC also has a poor human rights record. \n \nApplicant denies having \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d between the U.S. and any foreign \ncountry. It should be noted Applicant\u2019s allegiance to the U.S. was not challenged in this \nproceeding. The issue is rather a positional one.  \n \n[Guideline B] hinges not on what choice Applicant might make if he is \nforced to choose between his loyalty to his family and the United States, \nbut rather hinges on the concept that Applicant should not be placed in a \nposition where he is forced to make such a choice. ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005). \n \nOn balance, Applicant has not met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood \nthat [his relationship with his parents] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d The nature of the PRC\u2019s government and its ongoing intelligence \ngathering activities against the U.S. places Applicant in just this position, given his close \nrelationship with his family and their continued presence and connection with Hong \nKong and the PRC. Accordingly, mitigating condition 8(a) does not apply. However, \nApplicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships with and within the U.S. warrant \napplication of mitigating condition 8(b). \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \n In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                          \ncircumstances.\u201d3 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  \n \nBecause foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of \nparticipation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of \nthe nine APFs to this adjudication.4 In addition to the eighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the \nclearance decision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.    \n \n \n The Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis to address \u201cevidence of \nan applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to \nthe U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Hong Kong. Several circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole \nperson analysis. First, the PRC is a nuclear power and PRC\u2019s government is a rival of \nthe United States. The PRC is an authoritarian, Communist state. More importantly for \nsecurity purposes, PRC actively seeks classified and industrial and economic \ninformation. The PRC may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s parents and family members who \nlive in Hong Kong to obtain such information. Also, Applicant visited his parents in Hong \nKong from December 2006 to January 2007. Although Applicant has no immediate \nplans to visit Hong Kong, he did not rule out visiting Hong Kong in the future. Applicant \nalso maintains frequent contact with his parents and his younger brother when on \nschool break in Hong Kong. These contacts and visits are manifestations of the strong \naffection and regard Applicant has for family members in Hong Kong.   \n \n \n \nThere is mitigating evidence that weighs towards granting Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant is a U.S. born citizen and the U.S. is the only country for whom he \nclaims allegiance. He received his high school and college education in the U.S. Apart \nfrom brief times when his father was posted outside the U.S., he has lived in the U.S. \nHe was married in the U.S., and Brother (1) lives in the U.S. and Brother (2) lives in the \nU.S. attending college the majority of the year. His assets in the U.S. are substantial in \ncontrast to having no assets in Hong Kong. He is a U.S. citizen and U.S. passport \n \n3 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. \nAdams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n4 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the \neighth APF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. \nBd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for \nexploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                          \nholder. His wife is a U.S. citizen and his in-laws are U.S. citizens. His parents are U.S. \ncitizens and his two brothers are U.S. citizens. His parents own a home in the U.S., to \nwhich they intend to return upon completion of their missionary work in Hong Kong. \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties to the United States are stronger than his ties to his parents and \nlimited extended family in Hong Kong. There is no evidence Applicant has ever taken \nany action which could cause potential harm to the United States. He takes his loyalty to \nthe United States very seriously, and he has worked diligently for a defense contractor \nsince August 2004. Notably, Applicant successfully held an interim secret security \nclearance for four years. He also has the overwhelming support of senior company \nmanagement. His character evidence and demeanor strongly support the notion he is a \nvery trustworthy and honest person. The evidence contains no derogatory record \nevidence about the Applicant. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Hong Kong. Hong Kong is no \nlonger a British colony. Hong Kong remains a free and open society where human rights \nare generally respected. It has some autonomy, but remains connected to the PRC. The \nPRC has an authoritarian government, a less than stellar human rights record, and has \na very aggressive espionage program. The PRC conducts intelligence operations in \nHong Kong. \n \n \nI conclude that in the unlikely event that Applicant\u2019s family in Hong Kong would \nbe subject to coercion or duress from the Hong Kong government in an attempt to \nobtain sensitive information, Applicant because of his deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the United States. \n \n \nThis case must be adjudged on his own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that the Hong Kong government or its agents might exploit or \nattempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s family members in such a way that this U.S. citizen would \nhave to choose between his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and his family members. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and all the facts and circumstances \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns pertaining to foreign influence.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d5 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n5See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance, and recommended referral \nto an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on June 16, 2008, and elected to \nhave his case decided after a hearing. At the hearing held on August 25, 2008, \nDepartment Counsel offered two exhibits (GEs 1 and 2), and Applicant offered four \nexhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-D). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1, \n2 and AE A-D (transcript (Tr.) 26, 30, 49). I approved a delay until September 5, 2008, \nto permit Applicant to submit additional documents (Tr. 85-86). On September 3, 2008, I \nreceived AE E. Department Counsel did not object, and I admitted AE E. I received the \ntranscript on September 8, 2008.   \n \nFindings of Fact4 \n \nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR all of the SOR\u2019s allegations. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant became 23 years old in August 2008.5 He graduated from high school \nin June 2003 and from college in May 2007 with a bachelors degree. From December \n2007 to present, a government contractor has employed him as an associate, while he \nlearns the technical aspects of being an analyst. An analyst repeatedly runs computer \nprograms, and records the results (Tr. 50). From September 2007 to December 2007, \nhe was employed at a shop as an assistant manager. He has no military service. He \nhas never married. He is currently enrolled in graduate school, and his first class begins \nin late August 2008 (Tr. 27, 62; AE A). Applicant was a varsity soccer player in college \nand continues to play soccer in a club (Tr. 62-63).       \n \nDrug Involvement (Guideline H) \n \nOn his December 19, 2007, security clearance application, Applicant estimated \nhe used marijuana more than 300 times between December 2001 and August 2007, a \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4Ex. GE 2 (Responses to Interrogatories) and 5 (Response to SOR) are the sources for the facts \nin this section unless stated otherwise.   \n  \n5GE 1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated Dec. 19, 2007, will \nbe referred to as a security clearance application in this decision) is the source for the facts in this \nparagraph, and the next paragraph unless otherwise stated. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nsix year period (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Tr. 75). He sometimes provided marijuana to others (Tr. \n77). He also admitted using prescription drugs Aderol, Morphine and Vicodin seven \ntimes between August 2003 and August 2007 without having a prescription (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nHe used cocaine ten times between December 2004 and June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He \nused psilocybin or psilocin (hallucinogenic mushrooms) four times between November \n2006 and June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) (Tr. 75-76). He used opium once between November \n2005 and December 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n \nWhen Applicant played soccer for his college during the fall season, he did not \nuse drugs because of the NCAA drug testing program (Tr. 63-64). However, he used \ndrugs during the off season mostly out of boredom and peer pressure (Tr. 65-66, 71-\n72). He also knew the NCAA did not test during the off season (Tr. 65-66). When he \nused illegal drugs, he did not believe he would be caught by law enforcement (Tr. 72). \nHe is able to abstain from drug use while employed by the government contractor \nbecause he knows about the employer\u2019s random drug-testing policy (Tr. 64). He does \nnot want to disappoint his parents (Tr. 73). He recognized that drug use was selfish and \nnarcissistic (Tr. 74). \n \nApplicant\u2019s interim security clearance was denied in December 2007 (Tr. 59). \nApplicant understands the responsibilities and commitment related to holding a \nclearance because his father has held a clearance for years (Tr. 60). He believes he is \nready to hold a clearance (Tr. 60). Applicant does not physically associate with drug \nusers, but he still has some internet communication with drug users that he met in \ncollege (Tr. 57-58). For example, he expects to receive some e-mail greetings from drug \nusers that he associated with in college (Tr. 58). Although some of his associates visited \nfor a reunion a few weeks before his hearing, drugs were not used at the reunion (Tr. \n67). He used marijuana in high school, and now lives in the vicinity of his high school \n(Tr. 69). He rarely sees anyone he knows from high school (Tr. 69). Because he \nassociates with numerous soccer players, it is likely that he associates with drug users \n(Tr. 70-71). If he observed drugs being used, he would just leave the area (Tr. 67-68). \nHe was candid and honest about his past drug use (Tr. 61). His last drug use was in \nAugust 2007 (Tr. 68). He disclosed his drug abuse to his parents (Tr. 74). \n  \nApplicant\u2019s sister is 25 (Tr. 33). She opined that Applicant has integrity, honor \nand displayed candor during the clearance process (Tr. 33). She concluded with respect \nto these attributes that he was exceptional for a 23-year-old (Tr. 33). Applicant has \nseparated himself from his drug-using associates, who attended college with him \nhundreds of miles from where he currently lives (Tr. 36). She believed the last time he \nused illegal drugs was in August 2007, when friends from college visited him (Tr. 37).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father did not dispute the SOR\u2019s allegations of drug use (Tr. 82-83). \nHe emphasized that the only source of drug information was Applicant\u2019s disclosure, and \nthat Applicant had shown candor and honesty (Tr. 82). Applicant was not caught using \ndrugs. He emphasized Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness (Tr. 82). There was no diagnosis of \ndrug use, or recommendation to attend a rehabilitation program (Tr. 83).   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nSince November 2007, Applicant\u2019s sponsor at the government contractor \nobserves him at work on a daily basis (Tr. 39, 41). Applicant is hardworking, \nenthusiastic and learns quickly (AE B). Applicant shows attention to detail and is very \nconscientious (AE B). She believes Applicant is honest and trustworthy (Tr. 40). \nApplicant\u2019s drug use in college did not cause her to doubt his current reliability or \ntrustworthiness (Tr. 44, 45). She wrote a letter of recommendation dated June 10, 2008, \non his behalf (AE B; Tr. 42).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at the government contactor, Mr. B, has supervised him \nsince December 2007 (Tr. 47). Applicant does not currently have a security clearance \n(Tr. 56). Mr. B\u2019s office is adjacent to Applicant\u2019s office (Tr. 51). Mr. B has worked for the \ncontractor more than 29 years, and has held a Top Secret clearance for most of those \n29 years (Tr. 50, 52). Applicant exceeded nearly all of Mr. B\u2019s expectations (AE C). He \nlearns quickly and is goal oriented (AE C). Applicant\u2019s drug use was a concern that \nwarranted observation (Tr. 53). Mr. B believes Applicant had terminated his drug use \n(Tr. 55). Applicant\u2019s employer drug tests employees before they are hired, and \nthereafter they are randomly drug tested (Tr. 54). There is zero tolerance for drug use \nand the result of drug use is usually immediate dismissal (Tr. 54). Mr. B verified the \naccuracy of Applicant\u2019s performance appraisal (Tr. 48-49; AE C). Applicant is \ntrustworthy (Tr. 51). \n   \nDepartment Counsel conceded that Applicant\u2019s statement concerning automatic \nrevocation of his clearance if he used illegal drugs was adequate the meet the \nrequirements of revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 26(b)(4) (Tr. 78, 81; AE D), \ndiscussed infra. \n \nOn August 28, 2008, the President of Applicant\u2019s company, provided a letter \nstating at Applicant\u2019s request, the company would \u201cfacilitate random monthly drug \ntesting for a period of twelve months\u201d (AE E). \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n6See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n7\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nDrug Involvement (Guideline H) \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug8 involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nTwo drug involvement disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse\u201d9 and \u201cillegal drug possession, \nincluding . . .  purchase, sale or distribution [of illegal drugs]. . . .\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). \nThe other six disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable. These two \ndisqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used and possessed marijuana, \ncocaine, psilocybin or psilocin (hallucinogenic mushrooms), and opium. He also used \nAderol, Morphine and Vicodin without a prescription.   \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation. AG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n8AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances. See Sch. I (c)(9). See also Gonzales v. Raish, \n545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). Mushrooms are the street name for \npsilocybin or psilocin, which is a Schedule (Sch.) I Controlled Substance. See United States v. Hussein, \n351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a plant which may contain the Schedule I(c)(15) and \nI(c)(16) controlled substance psilocybin or psilocyn). Opium and cocaine are Schedule II Controlled \nSubstances. See Sch. II(a)(3) (opium); and Sch. II(a)(4) (cocaine).   \n \n9 AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d10 \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe Administrative Judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe Administrative Judge articulated a \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s last drug use was slightly more than a year ago, AG \u00b6 26(a) \nfully applies despite Applicant\u2019s last illegal drug use being relatively recent. His overall \nillegal drug use lasted approximately six years, and involved numerous uses of \nmarijuana, and other illegal drugs.11 AG \u00b6 26(a) applies because his drug use does not \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I am confident \nbecause of his previous demonstration that he could abstain from drug use and his \ncompany\u2019s random drug testing policy that his illegal drug possession and use will not \nrecur. Because he will not use illegal drugs in the future, his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment is restored.   \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has essentially disassociated from drug-using associates \nand contacts. He moved hundreds of miles from the location where he routinely abused \nillegal drugs, changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used. He \nabstained from drug abuse for slightly more than one year. He provided \u201ca signed \nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 26(b) \napplies.  \nAG \u00b6 26(c) is not applicable because his drug abuse did not follow an illness, and \nthese illegal drugs were never prescribed for him. AG \u00b6 26(d) is not applicable because \nhe has not completed a prescribed drug treatment program, and there has not been a \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.  \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended his drug abuse in August 2007. The motivations to \nstop using drugs are evident.12 He understands he will be terminated from his \nemployment if he abuses drugs, and his company is going to randomly test him on a \nmonthly basis for a year. He has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of no \ndrug abuse to warrant access to classified information.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an Administrative Judge stating: \n \nThe Administrative Judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history \nof improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the \nsecurity clearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times \na year from 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the \nillegal purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n11In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the Administrative Judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse.  \n \n12Retention of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free.  \n  \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.13     \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is significant. Applicant \nestimated his marijuana use at more than 300 times between December 2001 and \nAugust 2007, a six year period. Sometimes he provided marijuana to others. He used \nAderol, Morphine and Vicodin seven times between August 2003 and August 2007 \nwithout a prescription. He used cocaine ten times between December 2004 and June \n2007. He used psilocybin or psilocin (hallucinogenic mushrooms) four times between \nNovember 2006 and June 2007. He used opium once between November 2005 and \nDecember 2005. He has not completely cut off his contacts with individuals who use \nillegal drugs. His drug uses were knowledgeable, voluntary, and not isolated. He is \nsufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. Drug use is not prudent or \nresponsible. He did not receive counseling or therapy, and may not have a clear \nunderstanding about how to avoid problematic situations and why he engaged in the \nmisconduct.  \n \nThe evidence supporting approval of his clearance is more substantial. Applicant \nrevealed his drug abuse on his security clearance application. The only evidence of his \ndrug problem came from his admissions. I specifically find his statements about his drug \nuse and his changes in his drug-abusing behavior are credible. Applicant was young \nwhen he used illegal drugs, and was not yet 23 at the time of his hearing. He used \ndrugs because of boredom and peer pressure. He no longer has direct physical \nassociation with his drug-abusing peers, and if someone starts to use drugs in his \npresence he will leave the area. He was a student when he used drugs. Now he is in \nthe workforce where the consequences of drug abuse will be much more severe. He \n \n13 Although I find Applicant\u2019s drug abuse mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b), even if neither of \nthese mitigating conditions fully applied, I would still mitigate the security concerns under the whole \nperson concept.  \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nstopped using illegal drugs slightly more than a year ago. He knows if he uses drugs he \nwill be terminated from his employment and lose his security clearance. Especially \nimportant is the employer\u2019s promise to randomly test him on a monthly basis for a year \nto verify his abstinence. Future drug use, especially after his clearance is approved, will \nseverely damage his career. Applicant has begun graduate school, and is a valued \nemployee with excellent potential. There is no evidence at work of any disciplinary \nproblems. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate \nnational security. His law-abiding character and good work performance shows some \nresponsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His family, a co-worker, and his supervisor \nsupported approval of his clearance. I am satisfied that his current judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and his current ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and \nregulations warrant a security clearance. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude he has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to drug involvement.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d14 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Applicant is 47 years old, and has a high school diploma and some college. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Flight Test Instrumental Technician and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR.) After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant has been a member of the union since he started working in the aerospace industry in 1987. In October or November 2002, he started working for his previous employer. Nine months later, his supervisor called him at home and told him to report to the human resources office for a meeting. At the meeting, the Applicant was questioned about inappropriate conduct on his company computer, to be discussed under paragraph 2.

On November 19, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on January 15, 2010, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned Administrative Judge on March 11, 2010.  A notice of hearing was issued\non March 31, 2010, scheduling the hearing for May 24, 2010.  The Government\npresented twelve exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 12, which were admitted\nwithout objection.  The Applicant called one witness and presented three exhibits,\n\n2\nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C, which were admitted without objection.\nThe Applicant also testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until the\nclose of business on June 24, 2010, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit\nadditional documentation.  The Applicant submitted three Post-Hearing Exhibits,\nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 3, which were admitted\nwithout objection.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 15, 2010.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\nDepartment Counsel motioned to amend the SOR to include the following\nlanguage under subparagraph 2(a), that, \u201cYou were terminated and/or voluntarily\nseparated from your employer, in about December 2003, for accessing of inappropriate\nweb sites during work hours on your company computer.\u201d  (Tr. pp. 55-56.)  Applicant\nhad no objection to said amendment, and it was so ordered.  (Tr. pp. 56-57.)\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 47 years old, and has a high school\ndiploma and some college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Flight Test\nInstrumental Technician and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with\nhis employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR.)  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant has been a member of the union since he started working in the\naerospace industry in 1987.  In October or November 2002, he started working for his\nprevious employer.  Nine months later, his supervisor called him at home and told him\nto report to the human resources office for a meeting.  At the meeting, the Applicant was\nquestioned about inappropriate conduct on his company computer, to be discussed\nunder paragraph 2.    \nThe Applicant admits five of the six delinquent debt set forth in the SOR under\nthis guideline.  His delinquent debts totaled in excess of $8,000.00.  Credit Reports of\nthe Applicant dated August 8, 2007; May 30, 2008; August 10, 2009; October 23, 2009;\n\n3\nMarch 4, 2010; and May 23, 2010; collectively reflect each of the delinquent debts set\nforth in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12.)  The Applicant stated\nthat due to unexpected periods of unemployment, he and his wife fell behind with their\nfinancial responsibilities.\n       The Applicant became indebted to a creditor in the amount of $4,812.00 for a\nvehicle that was repossessed in July 2004.  He explained that because he was\nunemployed until March 2004, he fell behind on his payments.  When he got a job, his\nwife became unemployed in June 2004.  The car was repossessed.  The Applicant\ncontacted the creditor and worked out an agreement.  In late August 2004, the Applicant\npaid the vehicle off and the vehicle was returned to him.  He obtained financing through\nanother lender and paid approximately $5,348.82 to resolve the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A.)  In open hearing, he showed the court the vehicle\u2019s pink slip.\nHe is in the process of paying a delinquent credit card debt that was originally\n$1,666.00.  He has since reduced the debt to $800.00.  (Tr. p. 33 and Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit B.)  On May 28, 2010, the Applicant is scheduled to a make another payment of\n$403.18.  He will be left owing $400.00 that he plans to pay off by the end of June 2010.\nA delinquent credit card debt in the amount of $1,164.00 remains outstanding.\nThe Applicant stated that at one time, he hired a consumer credit counselor to assist in\npaying his bills that included this creditor.  The Applicant stated that he made payments\nto the consumer credit counselor for three months.  The creditor contacted the Applicant\nand informed him that they had not received any payments from the consumer credit\ncounselor and the total amount owing was due immediately.  The Applicant did not have\nthe money to resolve the debt.  The Applicant plans to pay the debt when he has the\nmoney to do so.  (Tr. p. 48.)\n  \nA delinquent telephone bill owed to a creditor in the amount of $167.00 remains\noutstanding.  The Applicant thought his wife had paid it and she thought he did.  He has\nnot had the money to pay it, but when he has the money he will do so.  (Tr. p. 48.)  A\ndelinquent medical bill or telephone bill owed to a creditor in the amount of $187.00\nremains outstanding.  He denies the debt to a creditor in the amount of $228.00\nbecause he does not know what it is.  (Tr. p. 71.)  He has not contacted the credit\nagencies or done any research to find out what it is.  The Applicant testified that his\npresent financial situation is tight.  There is not a lot of discretionary money.  However,\nhe plans to resolve his remaining debts as soon as possible. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline M - Use of Information Technology Systems)  The Government\nalleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nshown noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to\ninformation technology systems, which may raise security concerns.\nIn October 2003, the Applicant was terminated and/or voluntarily separated from\nhis employer for accessing of pornographic web sites, during work hours on his\ncompany computer.  (Government Exhibit A.)  As a result of an internal investigation, it\n\n4\nwas determined that the Applicant, for three consecutive days, spent at least six hours\nevery night accessing these sites.  The Applicant was working alone in his office, on\nsecond shift at the time.  \nHe testified that he tried to explain to his management, that he was living in a\ntrailer while his home was being built.  He did not have access to his personal e-mail, so\nhe was using his company computer to access his e-mail.  He admits that there were a\nfew website e-mails that inadvertently opened, such as Hustler Magazine and several\nothers.  Once he realized what was going on, he stated that he closed the e-mails and\ndeleted them as fast as he could.  He had also been listening to internet radio during\nthis time and believes it is very possible that whatever was found on his computer, such\nas pictures, may have been downloaded by the internet radio station on his computer,\nthus, using it as a mini-server.  \nThe Applicant admitted that he may not have logged-off every time he left his\ncomputer, such as to get something across the room or to answer the door.  He did not\ngive his password to anyone.  He tried to explain that the cipher combination on the\ndoor to his room was changed.  Applicant knew this for a fact because the people who\nchanged the lock came in when the Applicant was in the office.  He was told that they\nwere changed because access was breached by unauthorized persons.  He believes\nthat the cipher lock had been changed either on July 3 or August 3.  The security officer,\nwho was present at the meeting, denied that the combination had been compromised\nand that the lock had been changed.  (Government Exhibits 5 and  6.)  \nThe Applicant admitted that he understood the rules and regulations governing\nthe use of company computers.  He clearly knew that he was not authorized to access\npornographic web sites.  He admits that he was not authorized to access his personal e-\nmail.  (Tr. p. 58.)  Although he did not have to access internet radio to do his job, he is\nnot aware of anything that told him that he could not listen to internet radio while at\nwork.  (Tr. p. 57.)  \nThe Applicant believes that he was wrongly accused.  He does access these\ntypes of web sites at home, but never intentionally at work.  Other employees who\ncommitted the same violation were given warnings or minor penalties.  He believed that\nhis termination might have been personal.  He was an outsider.  People were vying for\npositions, there was lots of backstabbing; and although he was a member of the local\nworkers union, he did not feel that he was being properly represented.  He explained\nthat due to competition between unions, workers who have transferred from one union\nto another, as he had, in order to get a job at a different facility, created serious\nanimosity.  He believes he fell in the middle of this tenuous situation.  \nThe Applicant became physically sick as a result of this incident.  He started\nhaving chest pains, became very depressed, and was seeing a counselor for a short\ntime.  He was placed on medical leave from his job for a six week period.  In March\n2004, he met with his company and union representative and finalized the matter.  He\ninitially wanted to file a grievance but after speaking to a few attorneys he thought his\n\n5\nbest option would be to terminate from the company and let everything drop.  (Tr. p .62.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s settlement agreement indicates that he was able to negotiate that he\n\u201cresigned\u2019 or \u201cvoluntary quit\u201d rather than being discharged for his misconduct.  He is\nalso restricted from working with the defense contractor or any subsidiaries or affiliated\nbusinesses represented by the union.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2.) \nFinally, the Applicant states that when he was hired by his present company, he\ndisclosed on his employment application that he had voluntarily terminated employment\nfor accessing pornographic web sites during work hours on a company computer.  \nApplicant\u2019s present supervisor testified that the Applicant has been working for\nhim for almost four years.  He observes him on a daily basis, and considers him to be\nan excellent team player, who is trustworthy.  His supervisor was aware of the Applicant\nfinancial problems, but not aware of the allegations brought against the Applicant\nconcerning the accessing of inappropriate web sites on the company computer during\nprior employment with a different company.  \nA letter from a past supervisor during the period from 1987 to 2001, and who car\npooled with the Applicant for several years, attests to the Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness.\nHaving worked with the Applicant, he finds it hard to believe the charges that were\nbrought against the Applicant.  He finds it troubling that they did not appear to represent\nhim properly, if at all.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 3.)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n\n6\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the condition that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstance;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems)\n39.  The Concern.  Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations\npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability\nto properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.  Information\nTechnology Systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and\ndata used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or\nprotection of information.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n40 (e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology system.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n41 (a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\n\n7\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility and misuse of information technology systems,\nwhich demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n8\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and that he misused\ninformation technology systems (Guideline M).  This evidence indicates poor judgment,\nunreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope\nand nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his\nsecurity clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant is in the process of resolving his\nindebtedness.  He has paid off one of the debts and is making payments toward\nanother.  The three that remain outstanding are smaller debts that he plans to resolve\nas soon as possible.  I find him to be credible in this regard.  \nThere is sufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance and, 20(d) the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  The\nApplicant has indeed made a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve his debts.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).  \nThe situation involving his misuse of the company computer during work hours to\naccess pornographic material is troubling.  First, the Applicant testified that he disclosed\nthis information to his employer, when he was hired.  But, his witness, a supervisor who\nwas involved in hiring him, testified that he had no knowledge of the incident.  Why the\nApplicant did not disclose this to him even before he testified is puzzling.  Secondly, the\nApplicant was going to obtain documentation from his employer, namely a copy of his\nemployment application that would have shown that he disclosed this information up\nfront to his employer.  The document was not presented.  \nHowever, the Applicant credibly testified that he did not knowingly and willing\nlook at the pornographic web sites and explained those circumstances.  Furthermore\nthere is evidence in the record that can be interpreted to show that at the end of all of\nthis, he was not properly represented by his union.  He wanted to grieve the action, but\ndid not get the support he needed from his union representative.  Although there is no\nevidence of certainty, it does appear that the Applicant, an outsider, may have been set\nup, was unwanted, and this was a way to get rid of him.  Under the particular facts of\nthis case, I find that the Applicant has provided sufficient documentation to bring this\nissue into question.  \nThe fact remains that the Applicant clearly violated company policy by accessing\npornographic sites during work hours on his company computer.  He knew it was\nagainst policy.  Use of Information Technology Systems, Disqualifying Condition 40 (e)\n\n9\nunauthorized use of a government or other information technology system applies.\nHowever, Mitigating Conditions 41 (a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\nalso applies.    \nSince this incident in 2003, the Applicant has not engaged in any further\nmisconduct.  He understands his present company\u2019s policies and procedures and is\ncomplying with them to the letter.  He has been severely punished for his past\nmisconduct, and has no intentions of ever violating DoD policy or his company policy\nagain.  He plans to properly protect classified information at all times.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement, that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about January 2006 to at least September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), cocaine in at least Summer 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin) in at least 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, DOHA alleged that Applicant falsified his February 2008 e-QIP by not disclosing his use of cocaine and psilocybin (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Because of the alleged falsification of his e-QIP, Applicant was alleged under Guideline J, criminal conduct, to have committed a felony violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Applicant admitted the allegations, but offered to submit a statement of intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 24-year-old computer hardware engineer who has been employed by a nonprofit federally funded research and development firm since February 2008 (Ex. 1, Tr. 25). He requires a security clearance for his duties (Ex. B). Applicant attended a vocational/technical high school from September 1998 to May 2002. He graduated first in his class (Tr. 23) and, in August 2002, began college studies in electrical and computer engineering.

Norman, Esquire, Chief Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Andrew J. McKay, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on February 8, 2008. On July 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Guideline E, and Guideline J that provided the\nbasis for its decision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 12, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September\nJanuary 26, 2009\n\n2\n23, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for him. Counsel for Applicant entered his appearance on\nOctober 14, 2008. On October 21, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for November 19, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled on November 19, 2008. Two government\nexhibits (Ex. 1-2) and two Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-B) were admitted without any\nobjections and Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on\nNovember 28, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement, that Applicant used\nmarijuana with varying frequency from about January 2006 to at least September 2007\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), cocaine in at least Summer 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and hallucinogenic\nmushrooms (psilocybin) in at least 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline E, personal\nconduct, DOHA alleged that Applicant falsified his February 2008 e-QIP by not\ndisclosing his use of cocaine and psilocybin (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Because of the alleged\nfalsification of his e-QIP, Applicant was alleged under Guideline J, criminal conduct, to\nhave committed a felony violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Applicant admitted\nthe allegations, but offered to submit a statement of intent not to use any illegal drugs in\nthe future. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 24-year-old computer hardware engineer who has been employed\nby a nonprofit federally funded research and development firm since February 2008 (Ex.\n1, Tr. 25). He requires a security clearance for his duties (Ex. B).\nApplicant attended a vocational/technical high school from September 1998 to\nMay 2002. He graduated first in his class (Tr. 23) and, in August 2002, began college\nstudies in electrical and computer engineering. He had work-study obligations of about\n15 hours a week around his academic schedule, and resided during his freshman year\nin a dormitory at the college (Tr. 21).\nAlthough Applicant had not previously used illegal drugs, in about May 2003,  he\njoined a fraternity that had a reputation on campus for marijuana use among its\nresidents (Tr. 52). He continued to focus on his academic studies and to fulfill his work-\nstudy obligations, abstaining from illegal drugs and alcohol out of fear that he might\nbecome an alcoholic or addict as his father had been (Answer, Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 27, 51).\nToward the end of his junior year in college, Applicant began to experiment with\nalcohol. He found he could drink responsibly at college parties without letting alcohol get\nin the way of his studies or personal relationships (Answer, Tr. 27, 51). In January 2006,\nat the start of his last college semester, Applicant tried marijuana. Although he did not\nenjoy marijuana as much as he did alcohol, he smoked the drug, usually at weekend\nparties at the fraternity house (Answer, Ex. 2, Tr. 27, 35). On occasion, Applicant\nsmoked marijuana with longtime friends from his hometown (Tr. 40). Applicant did not\nseek out the marijuana but smoked when it was offered to him (Tr. 28). In May 2006,\n\n3\nApplicant was awarded his B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering (Ex. 1).\nHe was given an academic prize for being one of the top students in his major (Tr. 22-\n23). During his four years as an undergraduate, Applicant volunteered every year in\nlocal events to benefit the Special Olympics and March of Dimes (Tr. 24).\nIn July 2006, Applicant relocated to pursue graduate study in electrical and\ncomputer engineering, which he commenced that September (Ex. 1, Tr. 23). He\ncontinued to work about 15 hours a week at the hardware engineering company where\nhe had been employed part-time since March 2006 (Tr. 21-22). The company built high-\nend computers for signal and image processing applications and performed work for the\nU.S. government (Tr. 30-31). Applicant was unaware of whether the company had a\npolicy against substance abuse (Tr. 31).\nIn May 2007, Applicant left the job for a research assistant position in the\nuniversity\u2019s college of engineering (Ex. 1, Tr. 34). Applicant tried cocaine and psilocybin\none time each in 2007. He used the cocaine while at a party at a female friend\u2019s\napartment sometime that summer (Ex. 2, Tr. 28). He did not experience immediate\nnoticeable effects other than to become more talkative, but the following day felt a \u201cbit of\na craving for it.\u201d (Tr. 42) Concerned about the financial cost and potential addiction\nassociated with continuing to use cocaine, he resolved not to use it again (Tr. 28-29,\n42). He used the hallucinogenic mushrooms out of curiosity with a close friend, whom\nhe has known since middle school (Ex. 2, Tr. 41). The drug had unpleasant effects (\u201clike\nfood poisoning\u201d) such that it was not worth trying again (Tr. 42-43).\nApplicant continued to use marijuana while in graduate school until about\nSeptember 2007 (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 34). In January 2008, Applicant was awarded his\nmaster\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering (Ex. 1, Tr. 23).\nIn about November 2007, Applicant attended a career fair at the university where\nhe learned of job opportunities with his current employer (Tr. 24). On being called in for\na job interview, Applicant decided to refrain from any future use of illegal drugs (Answer,\nTr. 44). He accepted a position while he was working on defending his thesis (Tr. 25). \nNeeding a security clearance, Applicant executed an e-QIP on February 8, 2008.\nHe responded affirmatively to whether he had illegally used any controlled substance\nsince the age of 16 or in the last seven years, whichever is shorter. He disclosed he had\nused marijuana an estimated 15 times between January 2006 and September 2007,\nand added the following comment: \u201cOccasional responsible recreational use. Never a\nheavy user, I have stopped using for personal and professional reasons.\u201d (Ex. 1).\nApplicant did not disclose the \u201cisolated occasions\u201d on which he used cocaine and\npsychedelic mushrooms in \u201cself-defense and self-preservation.\u201d He believed they did\nnot reflect him as a person and he did not want to embarrass or incriminate himself or\nhis friends (Answer). Except for a few friends, no one was aware that he had used\ncocaine and psilocybin and Applicant was concerned that others would learn about\nthese \u201cmistakes\u201d that he was ashamed about (Tr. 38-39). Applicant regrets his \u201cpoor\n\n4\njudgment\u201d in not revealing his involvement with cocaine and psilocybin on the e-QIP (Tr.\n38).\nAfter he submitted his security clearance application, Applicant realized it was\nnot his call to make about whether or not the drug use reflected adversely on his\ncharacter, including his trustworthiness (Tr. 39). On March 12, 2008, Applicant was\ninterviewed by a government investigator about his illegal drug use. He indicated that he\nused marijuana approximately 15 times from January 2006 to September 2007. He was\nunable to recall when he last used marijuana other than it occurred at least five months\nearlier. He had smoked it with two of his closest friends, including his friend from middle\nschool, although it was usually at random parties on weekends in college. Applicant\naverred he had resolved not to use any illegal drug in the future as soon as he heard\nabout his present job. After he had discussed his marijuana involvement, he was asked\nwhether there was anything else he wanted to add (Tr. 46). At that point, Applicant\ndisclosed  he had tried cocaine and psilocybin once each while socializing with different\nfriends, and that he had omitted this involvement from his e-QIP because of his one-\ntime abuse of the substances. Applicant denied ever purchasing any illegal drug and\nany intent of future involvement (Ex. 2).\nApplicant was aware when he used marijuana, cocaine, and psilocybin that the\nuse of such substances was illegal. He personally does not believe he should be\nlabeled as a criminal because of his drug use, which he characterized as \u201csafe,\nresponsible, recreational, and very occasional.\u201d (Answer). He has yet to formulate an\nopinion as to whether cocaine should be illegal (Tr. 53-54). He is willing to execute a\nstatement of intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future (Tr. 47). \nApplicant continues to socialize with the old friends from his hometown with\nwhom he used marijuana on occasion and psilocybin once in the past. He considers\nthem his \u201cbest friends.\u201d He is also still friendly with \u201ca handful\u201d of his college friends with\nwhom he smoked marijuana in the past (Tr. 40). Applicant has had the opportunity to\nuse marijuana while socializing with his friends since September 2007, to include as\nrecently as November 2008 (Tr. 49). He refrained from illegal drug use but others used\nmarijuana in his presence (Tr. 50). Applicant did not see it as a problem since he did not\npartake (\u201cI mean if my friends want to make their own decisions, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Tr. 50).\nMarijuana is around \u201cnot all the time but frequently enough\u201d in that context (Tr. 44).\nWhen asked whether he intended to continue to associate with his drug-using friends,\nApplicant responded:\nI mean if you want me to leave the room, that\u2019s not a problem, but I mean\nsome of these people are my best friends. Some of them aren\u2019t my best\nfriends, they are just people I happen to hang out with, but I mean none of\nthem are really heavy users either. (Tr. 57-58)\nApplicant has told his friends that he  no longer uses illegal drugs (Tr. 50). Realizing  the\nopportunity for drug use persists within his social circle, Applicant submits he has \u201cthe\nstrong willpower to avoid the situations\u201d if he needs to (Tr. 58).\n\nIn response to whether his parents know of his drug involvement, Applicant responded, \u201cI have had\n1\nto tell my dad.\u201d (Tr. 39). It may reasonably be inferred that other family members, including his mother, remain\nunaware. \n5\nIn his first few months on the job with the defense contractor, Applicant became a\nkey contributor on his primary task focusing on the security of information in embedded\ndevices, and in a part-time task involving a next generation of communications protocol\nfor the military (Ex. A, Tr. 26). His level of performance set him apart from other entry-\nlevel staff members (Ex. A). Applicant\u2019s supervisor attests that Applicant has the skill set\nin hardware design, digital signal processing, secure electronics, and embedded\nsystems needed for the work in the electronic systems development department of the\ncompany, and that the nature of the work requires classified access (Ex. B). Applicant\nunderstands  he needs the clearance to keep what he regards as \u201ca dream job\u201d for him\n(Tr. 29). His employer and most of his friends are unaware that he has used cocaine or\npsilocybin. Although Applicant has told his father about his drug involvement, he has not\ntold other family members (Tr. 39).1\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n6\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d Applicant began using marijuana during his senior year of college. He\ncontinued to smoke the drug while in graduate school until about September 2007. He\nalso tried cocaine and psilocybin one time each in 2007 when socializing with friends.\nAG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d applies. Apart from having physical control of marijuana,\ncocaine, and psilocybin on the occasions of usage, there is no evidence that Applicant\notherwise possessed illegal drugs or paraphernalia that would warrant application of AG\n\u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d\nConcerning potential factors in mitigation under Guideline H, Applicant\u2019s\ninvolvement with cocaine and psilocybin (once each) was \u201cso infrequent\u201d to fall within\nAG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is likely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d However, AG \u00b6 26(a) cannot\nreasonably be applied, given his marijuana involvement on about 15 occasions over a\n21-month time span and continuing to at least September 2007.\nIn his favor, Applicant resolved in Fall 2007 to refrain from any illegal drug use in\nthe future. When he answered the SOR and at his hearing, Applicant expressed his\nwillingness to execute the statement required for AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), \u201ca demonstrated intent\nnot to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (4) a signed statement of intent with\n\n7\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d While I do not doubt the sincerity of\nhis intent, there is an unacceptable risk of a relapse where he continues to associate\nwith friends who use illegal drugs. As recently as two weeks before his November 2008\nhearing, he remained in the presence of his friends while they smoked marijuana.\nAlthough he has told his friends that he no longer uses controlled substances, AG \u00b6\n26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 26(b)(2),\n\u201cchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs are used,\u201d clearly do not apply.\nWhile a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future can yet be shown by\n\u201can appropriate period of abstinence\u201d (see AG \u00b6 26(b)(3)), it must be considered that\nduring the past 14 months, Applicant has at times been in the presence of others\nsmoking marijuana around him. \nApplicant asserts he has the willpower to \u201cdefinitely avoid the drugs\u201d in the future,\nincluding to leave the room while his friends smoke. At the same time, he considers\nsome of them his best friends, and he is likely to continue to associate with them. They\nhave not changed their drug-using behavior around Applicant, who acknowledged at his\nhearing that the opportunity for him to use drugs is frequent enough. With his job on the\nline, one would expect that Applicant would at a minimum take steps to avoid being\naround when others are using illegal drugs. His failure to do so considerably undercuts\nhis reform.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhen Applicant applied for a security clearance in February 2008, he disclosed\nhis involvement with marijuana but deliberately omitted his abuse of cocaine and\npsilocybin out of embarrassment and concern that the information may become known\nbeyond the few friends aware of his then very recent abuse of those two drugs. The\nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201dpersonal conduct, or concealment of\ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing,\u201d are established.\n\n8\nApplicant is credited with detailing his involvement with both cocaine and\npsilocybin when he was interviewed in March 2008. While Applicant\u2019s admissions at that\ntime were in response to a general query from the investigator (Tr. 46), there is no\nindication he had to be confronted with the facts. AG \u00b6 17(a) applies in mitigation where\n\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification, before being confronted with the facts.\u201d His effort to correct the record is\nviewed as sufficiently prompt in this case, given it occurred at his first opportunity.\nApplicant was not asked at his hearing whether he knew he could have contacted the\ngovernment directly to correct the record.\nApplicant satisfies AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior or\ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that\ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is\nunlikely to recur,\u201d but only in part. He recognized on his own that his disclosure of his\nmore extensive involvement with marijuana did not relieve him of his obligation to report\nhis experimentation with cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms. He candidly admitted he\nwas in the presence of friends who were using drugs as recently as two weeks before\nhis hearing. But in light of the recency of his falsification and his continued concealment\nof his drug involvement from his employer and some family members, it is too soon to\nconclude that the behavior is unlikely to recur.  AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken\npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress,\u201d is implicated where Applicant informed his father about his drug involvement.\nAt the same time, he has yet to be forthcoming about his drug abuse with other family\nmembers, his employer, and the supervisor who provided a character reference on his\nbehalf. \nPersonal conduct concerns may be raised by ongoing association with persons\ninvolved in criminal activity, which would include illegal drugs (see AG \u00b6 16(g),\n\u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity\u201d). As discussed under Guideline H,\nsupra, Applicant also exercised poor judgment that would fall within the general\nconcerns underlying Guideline E (see AG \u00b6 15) by using illegal drugs. Since his drug\nabuse and ongoing socialization with drug-using friends were not alleged as raising\npersonal conduct concerns, they cannot provide independent bases for denial under\nGuideline E. However, they are appropriate to consider when evaluating Applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for continued access to classified information under the whole-person\nconcept, infra. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern about criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d By signing his February 2008 e-QIP, Applicant certified his\nstatements on the form were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge\nand belief and [were] made in good faith.\u201d He was on notice that a knowing and willful\nfalse statement was punishable as a crime. His deliberate omission of his cocaine and\n\n9\npsilocybin involvement from his e-QIP constituted felony violations of federal law under\n18 U.S.C. \u00a71001. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted,\nor convicted,\u201d applies.\nAs discussed under Guideline E, supra, his voluntary rectification at his first\navailable opportunity carries considerable weight in assessing his rehabilitation. After he\nsubmitted his e-QIP, Applicant realized he was not in a position to determine what\nshould be considered in evaluating his security suitability or personal character. He was\ncandid at his hearing about his ongoing association with illegal drug users, and about\nhis enjoyment of the effects of at least the marijuana and cocaine (\u201cI can\u2019t sit here and\nhonestly tell you that drugs don\u2019t make you feel good,\u201d Tr. 28).  His recent performance\nevaluation (Ex. A) confirms his positive contributions at work, and he has a record of\ncommunity involvement in that he volunteered to assist with the Special Olympics and\nthe March of Dimes while in undergraduate school. However, I am unable to fully apply\nAG \u00b6 31(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d Applicant risks future drug abuse and exhibits extremely poor judgment\nby remaining in situations conducive to relapse. His family, most of his friends, and his\nemployer, are likely unaware of his continued socialization with known drug users.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant knew when he used controlled substances during his last year of\ncollege and in graduate school that his conduct was illegal. Concerned that his\ninvolvement with drugs like cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms could affect others\u2019\nopinions of his character, he was not completely forthcoming about his illegal drug\n\n10\ninvolvement on his security clearance application. While his decision to forego future\ndrug use and his subsequent candor with the government alleviate some of the security\nconcerns in this case, considerable doubts persist about his judgment and reliability\nwhere just two weeks before his hearing, he chose to remain around his friends while\nthey smoked marijuana in his presence. His failure to appreciate the inappropriateness\nand risk presented by that behavior post-SOR is especially troubling. Based on the\nrecord presented, I am unable to conclude it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 23, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\n\n2\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  After considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Mark W. Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief discuses various matters not contained in the record. The Board\ncannot consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive E3.1.29.\nApplicant\u2019s brief does not discuss the Judge\u2019s decision but raises evidence of mitigation.  The\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security\nclearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient\nto demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \n   \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes\nthat the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Borgstrom, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern because \nhe did not present sufficient information about his efforts to pay or resolve his six \ndelinquent debts, totaling about $15,500. Personal conduct security concerns are \nmitigated. Access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 29, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Item 5). \nOn July 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) (Item 1) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n \n1Revised Adjudicative Guidelines promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, apply to \nApplicant\u2019s adjudication and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense \n(DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended. \nNovember 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                           \nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn August 1, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 2). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated September 5, 2008, was provided to \nhim, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.2 Applicant did not provide additional documents \nwithin the 30 days. On November 5, 2008, the case was assigned to me.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($324), 1.c ($486), 1.d \n($14,078), 1.e ($55), 1.f ($177), and 1.h ($554) and he denied responsibility for the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($88) and 1.g ($33) (Item 2). He admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 \n1.i, which indicated he had the resources make payments on his delinquent debts (Item \n2). He said payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f were deferred until July, and \nhe is seeking deferment of the payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c (Item 2). He also \nexplained that he was not paying his debts because he wanted the divorce court to \ndecide the allocation of his marriage\u2019s assets and liabilities. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old.3 He has worked for a federal contractor since October \n2003 as an over the road (OTR) truck driver. For the last 10 years all of his employment \nhas been as a truck driver. He married in 1977, and divorced on May 14, 2007. His \nthree children or stepchildren were born in 1978, 1981 and 1981. He is currently \ndivorced. He served in the military from January to February 1976.4 He attended a \nvocational/ technical school and received a certificate in 1982. He has no police record. \nHe has not used or trafficked in illegal drugs in the last seven years, and has never \nused illegal drugs while in a sensitive position. \n \n \n2Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated September 11, 2008, \nand Applicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated September 15, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed \nApplicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n3Item 3 (Aug. 29, 2007 SF 86) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated \notherwise. \n \n4 In Section 19 of his SF 86, Applicant said he received a dishonorable discharge and explained, \n\u201cThe discharged (sic) was classified as dishonorable for 2 years. After the 2 years, it is now classified as \nHonorable.\u201d Because a dishonorable discharge cannot be approved unless a general court-martial \nadjudges it as part of the sentence and Applicant denied being charged with any criminal offenses in \nSection 23, and there is no such automatic upgrade provision for punitive discharges, I will assume \nApplicant is mistaken about the characterization of his brief period of military service. \n\n \n3 \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for six delinquent debts and denied \nresponsibility for two debts (Item 2). The details of the six delinquent debts are outlined \nin the following table. \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nand Amount \nCredit Bureau Report\nSept. 12, 2007 \nCredit Bureau Report \nJune 24, 2008 \nSource \n1.a--$324 \nIndiv Acct  \nLast activity on \naccount in July 2003 \nDelinquent since  \nJuly 2003 \nItems 5 & 6 \n1.c--$486 \nJoint Acct \n \nNot listed \n90 days delinquent \nItem 6 \n(Second \nMortgage) \n1.d--$14,078 \nIndiv Acct \nDelinquent since \nMarch 2006 \nDelinquent since  \nMarch 20065\n \nItems 5 & 6 \n1.e--$55 \nNot listed \nDelinquent since  \nMarch 2008 \nItem 5 \n1.f--$177 \nNot listed \nDelinquent since \nMarch 2008 \nItem 5 \n1.h--$554 \nIndiv Acct \nDelinquent since \nJuly 2007 \nNot listed \nItem 6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement (PFS) lists a gross salary of $5,300 and \na net salary of $4,500 (Item 4). His monthly expenses total of $1,590 included $690 for \nalimony/child support/daycare (Item 4). After deduction of his monthly expenses and \ndebt payments from his monthly income, $892 remained (Item 4). His PFS showed the \nfollowing debt and payment information: \n \nAccount Type \nDebt Status \nTotal Amount \nOwed \nActual Monthly \nPayment \nMortgage \nNot Listed \n$65,000 \n$700 \n2nd Mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nNot Listed \n$23,000 \n$243 \nTruck Payment \nNot Listed \n$14,000 \n$302 \nPersonal Loan \nNot Listed \n$13,000 \n$605 \nPersonal Loan \nNot Listed \n$1,700 \n$102 \nJewelry Debt \nNot Listed \n$400 \n$45 \nComputer Debt \nNot Listed \n$500 \n$24 \nTotal \n \n$117,600 \n$2,021 \n \nApplicant admitted he had the means to resolve his debts. He said he had been \nadvised not to pay the delinquent debts until his divorce court allocated responsibility for \nthese debts (Item 2). He promised to pay the delinquent debts allocated to him stating, \n                                            \n5 The only SOR debt delinquent over $1,000 is the $14,078 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant \nexplained the SOR \u00b6 1.d debt resulted from 2003 vehicle repossession (Item 6). On August 1, 2008, he \nsaid he wanted the divorce court judge to decide whether half of this debt should be allocated to his \nformer spouse (Item 2). \n\n \n4 \n \n\u201cOnce a ruling has been made on what I am legally responsible for[,] all debts will either \nbe paid in full or monthly payment arrangements will be made.\u201d (Item 2 at 3).   \n \nThe FORM at pages 4-5 highlights the importance to Applicant of providing \ndocumentation supporting his good faith in the resolution of his delinquent debts: \n \nMore importantly, Applicant has failed to provide any documentation to \ncorroborate his claims, including his claim that he was advised not to pay \nany of these delinquent debts. In addition, there is no documentary \nevidence that Applicant has contacted any of these creditors either to \nexplain the situation, make payment plans, or defer payments. Nearly all \nof Applicant\u2019s alleged accounts are individual accounts and are of minimal \namounts, yet Applicant has taken no actions to resolve th[ese] debts. . . \nThere is no documentary evidence of any payments or payment \narrangements made on these accounts. \n \nThe FORM emphasized at page 7, \u201cApplicant has failed to explain and provide \ndocumentary evidence as to how he has been unable to take any steps to rectify his \nfinancial situation, given his high net monthly remainder [, p]articularly with respect to \nthe vehicle repossession which remained unresolved since 2003.\u201d The record does not \ncontain any correspondence from Appellant after receipt of the FORM.    \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n    \n \nApplicant disclosed he was fired from a job for a log violation in October 2006 \n(Item 3, Section 22). He revealed a state tax garnishment in September 2006 for \n$587.91 (Item 3, Section 27). He answered, \u201cNo\u201d on his SF 86, executed on August 29, \n2007, to two questions that are relevant to the issue of whether Applicant falsified his \nSF 86. Question 28a. \u201cYour Financial Delinquencies-180 Days In the last 7 years, \nhave you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and Question 28b. \u201cYour \nFinancial Delinquencies-90 Days Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d  \n \nIn his SOR response Applicant said he was truthful when he provided information \non his SF 86. He explained why he did not disclose the information above about his \ndelinquent debts: \n \nWhen I answered those questions, I thought that all the debts were placed \non \u201cHOLD\u201d status until a ruling had been made by the Judge as to what I \nam responsible to pay. During the course of my marriage, my former \nspouse handled all financial matters. It wasn\u2019t until she filed for divorce, \nwas I aware that some of these debts even existed. I may have [been] \nmistaken in how the debts were being handled but I did not deliberately \nwithhold any information.  \n \nItem 2 at page 2.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                           \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by Applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [Applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n \n6 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n[A]pplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude two relevant security concerns are under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports and in his SOR \nresponse. He has six delinquent debts totaling approximately $15,500. His vehicle was \nrepossessed in 2003, eventually resulting in a $14,000 delinquent debt. These six debts \nremain delinquent today. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                           \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of any mitigating conditions. He \nhas not described any recent actions to resolve his delinquent debts. Because there are \nsix delinquent debts, the financial problems are not isolated. The ongoing nature of the \nsix delinquent debts for about $15,500 debt is \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under \nthe Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). There is no \nevidence supporting a conclusion that his debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur.\u201d Moreover, his delinquent debts do cast doubt on his \u201ccurrent \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 20(b), he said he was going \nthrough a difficult divorce, but he did not show his delinquent debts were \u201clargely \nbeyond his control.\u201d He did not establish that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.8  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant did not provide evidence of \nfinancial counseling. Moreover, there are not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant \nshowed good faith9 in the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts. \n \n8\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n9The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to mitigate any debts because Applicant did not \ndispute any debts. He did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute\u201d with respect to any delinquent SOR debts.   \n \nApplicant did not provide correspondence with his creditors to establish he acted \nresponsibly and in good faith. He said two delinquent debts were deferred until July \n2008 (Item 2), but he did not provide evidence of the deferment. After he received the \nFORM, he did not provide the current status of any debts, or provide any divorce court \nfilings showing his efforts to allocate marital debt. He should have been more diligent \nand made greater efforts to resolve his delinquent debt, especially after receipt of the \nSOR and FORM. His overall conduct with his creditors casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not carried his burden of proving \nhis financial responsibility. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I \nconclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n9 \n \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately provided false information or omitted \nrequired information on his 2007 SF 86 about his delinquent debts. Applicant admitted \nhe did not disclose six debts that were delinquent on his 2007 SF 86. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and \n16(b) apply, requiring further analysis.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) provides a condition that could mitigate security concerns in this case, \nstating, \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. Although he admitted \npreparing his SF 86, and failing to disclose any delinquent debts, he either did not know \nthe status of his debts or believed he was not legally responsible for the delinquencies \nuntil he received a ruling from the divorce court.10  \n \nOn his SF 86, Applicant disclosed negative information such as a garnishment, a \njob termination, and he erroneously disclosed a dishonorable discharge from the Army. \nThese disclosures show his state of mind and willingness to provide derogatory \ninformation and his lack of financial and legal sophistication. I conclude he did not \nknowingly attempt to mislead the government about his financial situation. Applicant\u2019s \nalleged falsification of his SF 86 is not substantiated. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n10The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n10 \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the AGs and the \nwhole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nThere is some mitigating evidence under the whole person concept. Applicant\u2019s \nrecord of good employment with a government contractor weighs in his favor. There is \nno evidence of any security violation. Aside from the delinquent SOR debt (which is a \ncivil, non-criminal issue), he is a law-abiding citizen. He does not have any record of \ninvolvement with illegal drugs. His other debts are current. The overall amount of his \ncurrent delinquent debt at about $15,500 is relatively low. His credit reports shows that \nhe has paid numerous debts over the years. These factors show some responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation.  \n \nThere is substantial evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. In 2003 he \nhad a vehicle repossessed. The debt resulting from that repossession is currently \ndelinquent and amounts to about $14,000. His six delinquent debts now total about \n$15,500. The FORM made it clear that he needed to resolve his delinquent SOR debts \nand provide documentation to corroborate his actions to resolve those debts. Waiting for \na divorce court to address his delinquent debts, especially when his divorce apparently \nbecame final in May 2007, does not convincingly allay security concerns about financial \nconsiderations. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the \nfacts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c to 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h and 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n For Applicant \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nSheldon I. Cohen, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 20, 2009 DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 28, 2011, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H.\nLeonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 48 years old.  She has\na bachelors degree which was awarded to her in 1984.  She married the same year.  She was a full-\ntime housewife and mother from 1986 to 1997 and had three daughters during that time.  Applicant\u2019s\nemployment history includes working as a contractor at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.  Her\noffice was located on an interior ring near the location where the commercial jet crashed into the\nouter ring of the building.  The explosion impacted her office and she and her colleagues\nsuccessfully evacuated the building.  Applicant has a good employment record and the central theme\nof the available information is that she is a reliable, dedicated, and competent employee and a\ntrustworthy person.  She is also active in her church and its community outreach ministry.\nApplicant\u2019s marriage was troubled for a period of years.  It ended in the alienation of her\nthree daughters from her as well as divorce in 1998.  During her marriage and after her divorce,\nApplicant was involved in numerous incidents indicative of questionable judgment.  In January 1994\nApplicant was involved in a domestic dispute with her husband which resulted in the police issuing\nher a citation or summons for disorderly conduct.  She had drunk alcohol prior to this incident.  In\nMay 1994, Applicant was involved in another domestic dispute with her husband.  The argument\nescalated to the point where Applicant, probably having a severe anxiety attack, struck herself in the\nleg with a shovel.  She may have threatened to hit her husband with the shovel.  She had feelings\nof wanting to hurt herself further.  She was admitted to the hospital \u201cby the detention process\u201d with\nan admission diagnosis of major depression, borderline personality disorder.  She described suicidal\nideation and homicidal ideation.  Although her husband initially pressed criminal charges, they were\ndropped.  Applicant was discharged from the hospital after a few days.  In September 1996,\nApplicant attempted suicide by hanging herself with an electrical cord in her garage.  The incident\nstemmed from an argument between Applicant and her husband.  Applicant was initially\nhospitalized and then transferred to the psychiatric unit of the hospital of her treating psychiatrist,\nwho was treating her on an outpatient basis.  In May 1997, Applicant cut herself on the wrist or\nforearm in an attempt to get her husband\u2019s attention.  She explained she did so as a coping\nmechanism to deal with the emotional pain she was experiencing at the time.\nIn June 1998, Applicant was involved in a domestic dispute with her husband.  She had\nconsumed several beers during a party.  As her husband was attempting to leave the location in a\nvehicle, Applicant struck the vehicle\u2019s side mirror with a rock and then threw the rock through a\nclosed window.  Applicant was arrested and charged by the police based on her husband\u2019s report\nthat she scratched him.  She spent a night in jail.  The charge against her was nolle prossed, but her\nhusband obtained a child protective order based on Applicant\u2019s emotional state and past history.  She\nwas removed from the household for 30 days.  Applicant and her husband divorced some months\nlater.  About a month after the 9/11 terrorist attack, Applicant was arrested for driving while\nintoxicated.  She was also charged with the felony offense of assault and battery upon a police\nofficer based on her conduct at the police station.  The incident stemmed from Applicant\u2019s drinking\ntoo many beers at a party hosted by her softball team.  Applicant pleaded guilty to the DWI charge,\nand the assault charge was nolle prossed.  In January 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with\nthe offense of public swearing/intoxication.  It was an alcohol related incident.  Applicant and her\n\nex-husband\u2019s new wife were having words at Applicant\u2019s former residence, which was rented out\nto a third party.  Applicant spent the night in jail and was released the next day.  The misdemeanor\noffense was eventually resolved when Applicant paid a small fine and court costs.  In January 2008\nApplicant received a summons to appear in juvenile and domestic relations court for the\nmisdemeanor offense of making annoying phone calls to her ex-husband.  This incident stemmed\nfrom Applicant\u2019s repeated phone calls to the residence of her ex-husband in an effort to speak to her\ndaughters.  Applicant appeared in court, paid a small fine, and was ordered to have no further\ncontact.  In addition, the record contains documentary evidence showing Applicant was listed as the\ncomplainant or victim on six occasions during 1993-2005.  It is probable that her husband was less\nthan an ideal spouse, and it is probable that he emotionally and physically abused Applicant.  \nApplicant has been under the care of a psychiatrist since 1994.  She has been hospitalized\nfor brief periods for mental health reasons four times since 1994.  The general Axis I diagnosis for\nthese treatments was adjustment reaction with depressed mood and major depression, recurrent.\nApplicant\u2019s psychiatrist\u2019s current diagnostic impression of Applicant, consistent since 2008, is\ndysthymic mood disorder (chronic depression) and his prognosis is good with continuous treatment\nbecause it is a lifetime illness.  He believes Applicant has been in remission for some time, that her\njudgment is good, she is not in crisis, and she requires minimal medication.  Applicant has been in\na close and intimate relationship with a gentleman for the last several years.  He thinks she has come\nto closure with her lack of relationship with her daughters, her consumption of alcohol is moderate,\nand she is no longer self-absorbed but is stable and comfortable with her situation.  Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent consumption of alcohol is moderate.  The last time she drank to the point of intoxication was\nin 2003. \nThe Judge reached the following conclusions: Taken together, the numerous incidents\nindicative of questionable judgment demonstrate a long-tern pattern of behavior.  This was for the\nmost part related to Applicant\u2019s failed marriage, which led to her acting out in anger or frustration\nor both to the point that she required hospitalization more than once.  The pattern often included\nlaw-enforcement intervention.  The pattern also included the periodic abuse of alcohol, although that\nis not a current concern.  The overall pattern of behavior raises a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying.  Applicant presented substantial evidence in mitigation, including a difficult and\nabusive marriage that contributed to many of the incidents, an outstanding employment record, a\nlong-term personal relationship that is providing stability, a positive outlook, an ability to cope, and\nan improved mental health situation.  Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is\noutweighed by a well established pattern of behavior that is indicative of questionable judgment.\nGiven that the last incident took place less than three years ago in 2008, it is too soon to tell if this\npart of Applicant\u2019s life is safely in the past or will recur yet again.  What is missing here is a long-\nterm track record of Applicant conducting herself as a stable, responsible and law abiding citizen.\nConsidering the numerous incidents, along with the multiple hospitalizations, a period longer than\nthree years without further problematic incidents is necessary to fully mitigate the security concern.\nApplicant argues that: (1) the Judge improperly underplayed the actions of Applicant\u2019s ex-\nhusband in evaluating the incidents giving rise to the SOR allegations and erroneously held\nApplicant accountable for the false and vicious attacks perpetrated upon her by her ex-husband and\nhis new wife; (2) the Judge ignored Applicant\u2019s strengths and accomplishments in lifting herself out\nof the morass that was her relationship with her husband; (3) the Judge gave undue weight to the\n\n2008 annoying phone call incident, which is the only incident on the record since 2003; (4) the\nJudge erred in not applying Guideline E mitigating factors in Applicant\u2019s favor; (5) the Judge\nengaged in a piecemeal analysis of the case; and (6) the Judge did not engage in a proper whole-\nperson analysis.  The Board construes these various arguments as an overall assertion that the\nJudge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\nultimate decision is sustainable.\nThe crux of Applicant\u2019s arguments is a disagreement with the Judge over emphasis.  The\nJudge\u2019s decision clearly indicates, and Applicant acknowledges, that the Judge recognized the\nconnections between the domestic strife between Applicant and her husband and the various\nincidents and involvements with the criminal justice system.  The Judge explicitly concluded that\nApplicant\u2019s circumstances were, to an extent, mitigating.  Applicant argues however that the Judge\nfails to grasp the magnitude of the suffering Applicant endured at the hands of her abusive and\nmanipulative husband and later his second wife. Applicant asserts that the Judge was, in essence,\n\u201cblaming the victim.\u201d  After a review of the entire record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\ninterpretation of the record evidence was reasonable.  The Judge discussed Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances over a period of many years in considerable detail, indicating that he carefully\nconsidered evidence favorable to Applicant.  The test on appeal is whether the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contradictory evidence in the same record. Directive, \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1.  The Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions satisfy this test.  The Board notes that the evidence\ndoes not establish that, in terms of physical altercation, Applicant\u2019s husband was the aggressor in\nall the incidents, nor was a dispute with her ex-husband connected to her arrest in 2001 for DWI and\nassault upon a police officer.     \nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and\nfactors.  The Judge properly considered the whole pattern of Applicant\u2019s involvements with law\nenforcement, her sometimes excessive use of alcohol, and her attempts to bring physical harm to\nherself, as well as the more favorable evidence of her conduct since 2008, and concluded that\nApplicant had not fully mitigated the government\u2019s concerns.  On these facts, under the Egan\nstandard, the Board is not prepared to conclude that the Judge was required to find that Applicant\nhad overcome those concerns.\nApplicant states that the Judge did not engage in a proper whole-person analysis. A review\nof the Judge\u2019s overall discussion and analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case convinces\nthe Board that the Judge adequately considered the whole-person factors, even if he did not\nspecifically discuss them under the whole-person rubric.  Applicant also asserts that the Judge\nengaged in a piecemeal analysis of the evidence in the case by not considering the circumstances\nbehind Applicant\u2019s charged conduct.  This is a variation of Applicant\u2019s primary argument that the\n\nJudge did not adequately consider Applicant\u2019s status as a victim of her husband\u2019s malfeasance.  For\nreasons previously articulated, the Board concludes that the Judge did not err on this point.\nMoreover, the Judge\u2019s decision indicates an emphasis on consideration of Applicant\u2019s overall\npattern of conduct, including the circumstances surrounding that conduct over a period of many\nyears.  This is the opposite of a piecemeal approach.      \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Applicant also asserts that the Judge engaged in a piecemeal analysis of the evidence in the case by not considering the circumstances behind Applicant\u2019s charged conduct. This is a variation of Applicant\u2019s primary argument that the Judge did not adequately consider Applicant\u2019s status as a victim of her husband\u2019s malfeasance. For reasons previously articulated, the Board concludes that the Judge did not err on this point. Moreover, the Judge\u2019s decision indicates an emphasis on consideration of Applicant\u2019s overall pattern of conduct, including the circumstances surrounding that conduct over a period of many years. This is the opposite of a piecemeal approach. The Board does not review a case de novo. The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd.

Mendez Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Sheldon I. Cohen, Esq.      \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke her eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance to work in the defense industry. She was in a troubled marriage that\nended in divorce in 1998. The evidence also shows that during 1994\u20132008, she was\ninvolved in numerous incidents indicative of questionable judgment. The incidents\ninclude domestic disputes with her husband. There were alcohol-related incidents such\nas drunk driving. And there were incidents where she engaged in self-inflicted injury and\nattempted suicide by hanging. She has been under the care of a psychiatrist since\n1994, and she has been hospitalized, for brief periods, for mental-health reasons four\ntimes since 1994, the last occurring in 2002. Her psychiatrist is of the opinion that\nApplicant now suffers from chronic depression, which has essentially been in remission\nfor the last several years. The psychiatrist is also of the opinion that her judgment is\nnow sound and her prognosis is good. Even though Applicant presented substantial\nevidence of mitigation, it is outweighed by a long-term pattern of behavior that is\nindicative of questionable judgment. Given that the last incident took place less than\nthree years ago in 2008, it is too soon to tell if this part of Applicant\u2019s life is safely in the\nFebruary 28, 2011\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   \n2\npast or will recur yet again. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided\nagainst Applicant.\n \n \nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on March 20,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it sets forth the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline E for personal conduct. The SOR also recommended that the case\nbe submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance.  \nOn April 21, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me August 10, 2010. The hearing took place pursuant to written\nnotice on October 12, 2010. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received October 20, 2010.\nProcedural Matters\nDepartment Counsel withdrew the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Accordingly, a formal\nfinding in Applicant\u2019s favor will be entered. In addition, Applicant denied the allegation in\nSOR \u00b6 1.g, and Department Counsel conceded there was no evidence to support it.\nAccordingly, a favorable formal finding will be entered as well. Neither allegation will be\ndiscussed further. \nFindings of Fact\nIn general, the SOR alleges that Applicant is unsuitable for a security clearance\nunder Guideline E for personal conduct based on a series of incidents, and a\nfalsification allegation, all of which demonstrate questionable judgment. In her Answer\nto the SOR, Applicant admits, with explanations, the majority of the factual allegations in\nthe SOR, but she denied, with explanations, the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.k, and 1.l.\nIn addition, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She is seeking to\nretain a security clearance previously granted to her by the Defense Department. Her\n\n Exhibit A. \n2\n Exhibits K and L. \n3\n Exhibits B\u2013I, O\u2013DD. \n4\n Exhibit DD. \n5\n Exhibit 5 at 20. \n6\n3\neducational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded to her in 1984.  She\n2\nmarried the same year. She was a full-time housewife and mother from 1986 to 1997.\nShe had three daughters, born in 1986, 1988, and 1989. In 1997, she began\nemployment as an officer manager for a federal contractor. She remained in that job\nuntil early 2002, when she was laid off. After a few months of unemployment, she began\nher current position as an executive assistant for a federal contractor. In her capacity as\nan executive assistant, she works as a contractor to a large executive office for one of\nthe military departments.   \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes working as a contractor at the Pentagon\non September 11, 2001. Her office was located on an interior ring near the location\nwhere the commercial jet was crashed into the outer ring of the building.  The explosion\n3\nhad an impact on her office and there was soon smoke in the office. It was necessary\nfor her and her colleagues to evacuate the building and they did so successfully.\nApplicant suffered no physical injuries.  \nApplicant has a good employment record. Her favorable  employment record,\nalong with her suitability for a security clearance, is supported by the testimony of\nseveral witnesses, written performance assessments from her employer, performance\nawards, and many letters of recommendation.  The central theme of this information is\n4\nthat Applicant is a reliable, dedicated, and competent employee and a trustworthy\nperson. She is also active in her church and its community outreach ministry; indeed,\none of the letters of recommendation is from her pastor.   \n5\nApplicant\u2019s marriage was troubled for a period of years. It ended in the alienation\nof her three daughters as well as a divorce in 1998. The evidence also shows that\nduring 1994\u20132008 (during her marriage and after her divorce), Applicant was involved in\nnumerous incidents indicative of questionable judgment. The incidents included\ndomestic disputes with her husband. There were also alcohol-related incidents,\nincluding drunk driving. And there were incidents where she engaged in self-inflicted\ninjury and attempted suicide by hanging. The incidents alleged in the SOR are\ndiscussed below. \nIn January 1994, Applicant was involved in a domestic dispute with her husband.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) The police described the event as \u201cdrunk in public/domestic dispute.\u201d  It\n6\nstemmed from an argument between Applicant and her husband while hosting a holiday\nsocial event for her family. The police issued her a citation or summons for disorderly\n\n Exhibit 5 at 22. \n7\n Exhibit 9. \n8\n Exhibit 9. \n9\n Exhibit 11. \n10\n Tr. 179\u2013181. \n11\n Exhibit 5 at 25. \n12\n4\nconduct, and she resolved the matter by a prepaid fine in lieu of a court appearance.\nShe had drunk alcohol before this incident. \nIn May 1994, Applicant was involved in a domestic dispute with her husband.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) The police described the event as \u201cpolice service\u201d as they responded to a\ncall for assistance.  It stemmed from an argument between Applicant and her husband\n7\nwhen he returned from a fishing trip intoxicated. The argument escalated to a point\nwhere Applicant, probably having a severe anxiety attack, struck herself in the leg with a\nshovel. She may have threatened to hit her husband with the shovel. She had feelings\nof wanting to hurt herself further. She was admitted to the hospital \u201cby the detention\nprocess\u201d with an admission diagnosis of major depression, borderline personality\ndisorder.  According to the discharge summary, she arrived in the hospital \u201cin an\n8\nagitated state, displaying impaired impulse control, exhibiting bizarre behavior and\nimpaired judgment. She was sleep disturbed, anxious. She described suicidal ideation\nand homicidal ideation.\u201d  Although her husband initially pressed criminal charges, they\n9\nwere dropped. She was discharged from the hospital after a few days. \nIn September 1996, Applicant attempted suicide by hanging herself with an\nelectrical cord in her garage. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) She was initially hospitalized and then\ntransferred to the psychiatric unit of the hospital of her treating psychiatrist, who was\ntreating her on an outpatient basis.  The incident stemmed from an argument between\n10\nApplicant and her husband. In a peak of anger, Applicant left the house and walked out\nto the garage where she hanged herself. She was discovered by a neighbor who was at\nthe home during the argument. The neighbor was assisted by Applicant\u2019s husband in\ncoming to the aid of Applicant.   \nIn May 1997, Applicant cut herself on the wrist or forearm in an attempt to get her\nhusband\u2019s attention. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) She denies slitting her wrist as alleged in the SOR.11\nShe explained she did so as a coping mechanism to deal with the emotional pain she\nwas experiencing at the time. \nIn June 1998, Applicant was involved in a domestic dispute with her husband.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f) The police described the event as \u201cdomestic assault.\u201d  It stemmed from an\n12\nargument between Applicant and her husband when he returned from a trip to the\nbeach with two of his daughters and Applicant was hosting a previously agreed to party\n\n Exhibit 6. \n13\n Exhibit 7. \n14\n Tr. 309\u2013310. \n15\n5\nfor coworkers. She had consumed alcohol, several beers, during the party. The\nargument escalated to the point that many of the party guests departed, which made\nApplicant more distraught and angry. As her husband was attempting to leave in a\nvehicle, she struck the vehicle\u2019s side mirror with a rock and then threw the rock through\na closed window. Applicant was arrested and charged by the police based on her\nhusband\u2019s report that she scratched him. She spent a night in jail. She appeared in\ncourt and the charge was nolle prossed. But her husband also obtained a child-\nprotective order based on her emotional state and past history, and she was removed\nfrom the household for 30 days. Applicant and her husband divorced some months later\nin 1998. \nAbout a month after the 9/11 terrorist attack, Applicant was arrested for and\ncharged with driving while intoxicated (DWI); she was also charged with the felony\noffense of assault and battery on a police officer based on her conduct in the police\nstation.  (SOR \u00b6 1.h) This incident stemmed from Applicant\u2019s drinking too many beers\n13\nat a party hosted by her softball team. While in the police station, Applicant began to hit\nher head against a wall. A law-enforcement officer was kicked by Applicant when she\nengaged in unruly and erratic behavior that included flailing her legs. Applicant\nappeared in court and pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor drunk driving offense. The\nother charge was nolle prossed. The court\u2019s sentence included confinement for 180\ndays, suspended, a $400 fine plus court costs, and suspension of her driver\u2019s license\nfor 12 months. \nIn January 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with the offense of public\nswearing/intoxication.  (SOR \u00b6 1.i) This was an alcohol-related incident as Applicant\n14\nhad consumed beer after taking prescribed anxiety medicine. The incident also took\nplace a few days after the funeral for Applicant\u2019s father, and she remained upset that\nnone of her daughters attended the funeral of their grandfather. Acting on her emotions\nor impulses, Applicant went to her former residence, which her ex-husband was renting\nto a mutual friend. Applicant thought the tenant would be able to provide the information\nabout her daughters. She was invited inside the home and then called the residence of\nher ex-husband. The call was answered by her ex-husband\u2019s wife (a former mistress\nduring their marriage) who then called the police. The ex-husband and his wife, along\nwith the police, went to the residence and the police determined trespassing was not\nvalid as Applicant was a guest. Applicant and the former mistress were having words\nduring this encounter, and as Applicant stepped outside the home, she called the former\nmistress a \u201cfat [expletive expletive],\u201d and she was arrested.  Applicant spent the night in\n15\njail and was released the next day. The misdemeanor offense was eventually resolved\nwhen she paid a small fine and court costs. \n\n Exhibit 5 at 33\u201334. \n16\n Tr. 314\u2013318. \n17\n Exhibit 5 at 36\u201341. \n18\n Exhibit 9. \n19\n Exhibit 9. \n20\n Exhibit 10. \n21\n Exhibit 11. \n22\n6\nIn January 2008, Applicant received a summons to appear in juvenile and\ndomestic relations court for the misdemeanor offense of making annoying phone calls to\nher ex-husband.  (SOR \u00b6 1.j) This incident stemmed from Applicant\u2019s repeated phone\n16\ncalls to the residence of her ex-husband in an effort to speak with her daughters.\nApplicant appeared in court, paid a small fine, and was ordered to have no further\ncontact.17\nIn addition, the record contains documentary evidence showing Applicant was\nlisted as the complainant or victim on six occasions during 1993\u20132005.  The records\n18\nfrom the county police department reported the following about Applicant: (1) the\ncomplainant in assault, domestic violence case with injuries of a bloody nose in 1993;\n(2) the victim in domestic dispute case in 1993; (3) the complainant in domestic dispute\ncase in 1994; (4) the complainant in domestic assault case with injuries of lacerations to\nleg and elbow in 1998; (5) the victim in domestic dispute case in 2001; and (6) the\ncomplainant in telephone harassment case in 2005. It is probable that her ex-husband\nwas less than an ideal spouse, and it is probable that he emotionally and physically\nabused Applicant. \nApplicant has been under the care of a psychiatrist since 1994. She has been\nhospitalized, for brief periods, for mental-health reasons four times since 1994, the last\noccurring in 2002. The first hospitalization took place in May 1994, when she argued\nwith her husband and struck herself with the shovel.  (SOR \u00b6 1.b) The diagnosis then\n19\nwas major depression and borderline personality disorder.  Based on this event,\n20\nApplicant was referred to a  psychiatrist and she has since been under his care.  The\n21\npsychiatrist\u2019s initial diagnostic impression in June 1994 was Applicant suffered from a\ndysthymic mood disorder and adjustment reaction with depressed mood. \nThe second hospitalization took place in September 1996, when Applicant\nattempted suicide by hanging.  (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The Axis I diagnosis remained the same,\n22\ndysthymic mood disorder and adjustment reaction with depressed mood.\n\n Exhibit 12. \n23\n Tr. 367\u2013369; Exhibits 4 and 4a. \n24\n Exhibit EE. \n25\n Tr. 227\u2013230; Exhibit 3. \n26\n Tr. 269\u2013270. \n27\n7\nThe third hospitalization took place in April 1998, toward the end of Applicant\u2019s\nmarriage.  She was admitted to the psychiatric unit for protection, assessment,\n23\ninpatient treatment, and stabilization after an argument with her husband when she\nconfronted him about taping her conversations. An unloaded handgun was also involved\nin the argument and led to her husband throwing her to the floor in an effort to take the\nfirearm from her. The Axis I diagnosis was adjustment reaction with depressed mood\nand major depression, recurrent. \nThe fourth hospitalization took place in March 2002.  It stemmed from the\n24\ncombined impact of the anxiety Applicant experienced from the events of 9/11 and the\nOctober 2001 DWI offense. She admitted herself to the psychiatric unit for treatment.\nShe was there on an inpatient basis for a week and then did a second week of daily\ntherapy on an outpatient basis.  \nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist testified at the hearing. He has been a licensed\nand practicing psychiatrist for more than 30 years and has treated thousands of\npatients.  His current diagnostic impression of Applicant is the same as it has been\n25\nsince at least 2008, when he concluded it was dysthymic mood disorder (chronic\ndepression in laymen\u2019s terms), and that her prognosis is good with continuous treatment\n(daily doses of Paxil), because it is a lifetime illness that requires treatment.  He\n26\nbelieves Applicant has been in remission for some time (perhaps since 2005), meaning\nthat she sleeps normally, her memory is good, her judgment is good, her function\nmentally and physically is good, she is not in crisis, and she requires minimal\nmedication.  Concerning a major source of Applicant\u2019s interpersonal strife, the\npsychiatrist believes that she has come to terms with the lack of a relationship with her\ndaughters.   \n27\nApplicant has been in a close and intimate relationship with a gentleman for the\nlast several years. The gentlemen met Applicant while working at the Pentagon and he\nwas working in the same office on September 11, 2001. He is now a retired military\nofficer and a member of the federal government\u2019s senior executive service. He made\nthe following observations about Applicant: (1) she went through a difficult transition\nperiod after the divorce and loss of her daughters, and that she is now a bedrock of\nstability; (2) her outlook and temperament are 100 percent better than in 2005; (3) he\nthinks she has come to closure with her lack of relationship with her daughters; (4) her\nconsumption of alcohol is moderate, limited to social drinking; (5) she is no longer self-\nabsorbed, but is stable and comfortable with her situation; and (6) he has no\n\n Tr. 137\u2013148. \n28\n Tr. 318\u2013320. \n29\n Exhibits 1 and 2.  \n30\n Tr. 320; Exhibits 4 and 4a. \n31\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n32\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n33\n8\nreservations recommending her for a security clearance, although he would have had\nsuch reservations in 2002.28\nApplicant\u2019s current consumption of alcohol is moderate. It consists of one or two\nbeers, or perhaps a glass or two of wine with dinner.  The last time she drank to the\n29\npoint of intoxication was in 2003.\nApplicant completed security clearance applications in 1996 and 2006.  In her\n30\n1996 application, she disclosed her mental-health treatment with the psychiatrist, and\nshe disclosed a 1996 disorderly conduct offense. In her 2006 application, she disclosed\nher mental-health treatment with the psychiatrist, and she disclosed her 2001 DWI\noffense in response to a question about alcohol-related offenses, but she did not\ndisclose the 2003 public swearing/intoxication offense. She explained that she omitted\nthis incident because she forgot about it.  On this point, I found her testimony to be\n31\ncredible and worthy of belief. \nLaw and Policies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n32\nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt\n33\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.  \n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n34\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n35\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n36\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n37\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n38\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n39\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n40\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n41\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n42\n9\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n34\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n35\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n36\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n37\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n38\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n39\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.40\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.41\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\ndecision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n42\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\n\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, and 17 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n43\n AG \u00b6 15. \n44\n10\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct,  the suitability of an applicant may be\n43\nquestioned or put into doubt due to false statements and credible adverse information\nthat may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. The overall\nconcern under Guideline E is:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n44\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission\nof relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about\nit, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported. \nThe first issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer to a question on her\n2006 security clearance application, when she failed to disclose the 2003 arrest and\ncharge for public swearing/intoxication, which should have been reported as an alcohol-\nrelated offense. Based on the evidence as a whole, including Applicant\u2019s disclosure of\nother adverse matters, I conclude Applicant answered the question incorrectly because\nshe genuinely forgot about it, and I am persuaded that she made no deliberate effort to\nhide, conceal, or omit information. On this basis, the falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.l\nis decided for Applicant.\nThe second issue here is the broader question of Applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance in light of the numerous incidents indicative of questionable\njudgment. Taken together, the incidents demonstrate a long-term pattern of behavior\nthat was for the most part related to her failed marriage, which led to her acting out in\nanger or frustration or both to the point that she required hospitalization more than once.\nThis pattern often included law-enforcement intervention. This pattern also included the\nperiodic abuse of alcohol, although that is not a current concern. This overall pattern of\nbehavior raises a security concern and may be disqualifying under the following\ncondition:\n\u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas\nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\n\n AG \u00b6 17(a)\u2013(g). \n45\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \n46\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)\u2013(9).\n47\n11\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information. \nThe guideline also has seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns.45\nThe most pertinent here are: \n\u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant presented substantial evidence in mitigation, which is not limited to the\nfollowing: (1) a difficult and abusive marriage that contributed to many of the incidents;\n(2) an outstanding employment record; (3) a long-term personal  relationship that is a\npositive factor in her stability, outlook, and ability to cope; and (4) an improved mental-\nhealth situation, with the last hospitalization taking place in 2002, ongoing treatment for\nchronic depression with minimal medication, and a good prognosis. Nevertheless,\nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is outweighed by a well established pattern of\nbehavior that is indicative of questionable judgment. Given that the last incident took\nplace less than three years ago in 2008, it is too soon to tell if this part of Applicant\u2019s life\nis safely in the past or will recur yet again.  What is missing here is a long-term track\n46\nrecord of Applicant conducting herself as a stable, responsible, and law-abiding citizen.\nConsidering the numerous incidents, along with the multiple hospitalizations, a period\nlonger than three years without further problematic incidents is necessary to fully\nmitigate the security concern.    \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s pattern of\nbehavior and questionable judgment justify current doubts about her suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these\ndoubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due\nconsideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence.\n47\nApplicant did not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \n\n12\nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.          \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On December 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 6, 2009. He requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on April 2,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 15, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on May 12, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1-7, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and presented the\ntestimony of one witness. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A-E which were admitted into the\nMay 26, 2009\n\n2\nrecord. I held the record open until May 19, 2009 for any documents that Applicant\nwished to submit. Applicant timely submitted three documents, which were marked as\n(AE) F-H and entered into the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on May, 20, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 9, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g of the SOR. He denied the other allegations. He\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\ncollege in 1997 and obtained a Master\u2019s Degree in computer science in 2000. he has\nworked for his current employer for one year (Tr. 32). He has held a security clearance\nsince 1997 (Tr.33).\nApplicant married in 2001. The couple separated and his marriage ended in\ndivorce in 2008. Applicant has one daughter, age seven years (Tr. 34.) Applicant\u2019s wife\nhad many medical problems during the marriage. In 2003, she could not work any\nlonger due to her medical condition. Suddenly, Applicant\u2019s family was reduced to living\non one income and also having a financial strain with additional medical bills. His\nincome alone was not sufficient to pay the bills. Applicant\u2019s savings were depleted due\nto his 2001 home purchase and upkeep on the house (Tr. 36). He eventually completed\na \u201cshort sell\u201d for the house.\nApplicant explained that his wife did not have good credit when they married and\nall the credit accounts were in Applicant\u2019s name. He also paid approximately $5,000 to\nthe Government for back taxes that his wife owed when they married. He acknowledged\nthat she spent money without considering if the family could afford the additional debt.\nApplicant listed in his budget a \u201chobby\u201d that accounts for an expenditure in his\nbudget. Applicant was candid and acknowledged that he has for some years been\ninvolved with collectible card games. He had a very large collection at one point in time.\nHe now has a smaller one and sells items on E-bay (Tr. 55).\nThe SOR alleged eight (8) delinquent debts, including a judgment, and credit\ncard bills. Applicant admitted the majority of the debts and his credit reports confirmed\nthem. He explained that as a result of the November 28, 2007 Separation Agreement,\nthe medical bills are the responsibility of his ex-wife (AE G, H).The total amount of\ndelinquent debt is approximately $48,925. \nIn 2005, Applicant obtained counseling and enrolled in the Debt Relief Network\nplan (GE 5). He consolidated his debt and originally paid $450 a month for the\nrepayment plan (Tr. 30). He now pays $700 a month. Applicant has addressed his\n\n3\ndelinquent debts. The plan prioritizes debts that can be settled and the money that\nApplicant has in the escrow account is applied (Tr. 37). Applicant expects that in less\nthan two years, the debts will be paid with the network plan (Tr. 74). \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $10,310 is pending settlement; the debt\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $12,305 was initially disputed because Applicant did not\nrecognize the account name. He has since realized that it is a duplicate of the debt\nalleged in 1.f. The original account is in the process of settlement (AE C). The debt\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $8,507 was settled in September 2008 (AE B). The debt\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $4,094 is a judgment for medical accounts that belong to his\nwife per the divorce decree (Tr. 44). The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $251 has been\npaid (AE A). The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $7,753 is pending final settlement in\nNovember 2009 (Tr. 48). The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $1,605 is pending\nsettlement as part of the consolidation plan. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h has been\nsettled for $837 (AE A). The settlement accounts are being paid under Applicant\u2019s Debt\nRelief Network Plan.\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $4,531. After his monthly expenses,\nincluding child support, he has a net remainder of $150-$200. His car is paid in full. He\nis current with his student loans. He is hoping to gain custody of his daughter soon and\nthat his wife will then pay child support to him. He follows a budget and is continually\nlooking for ways to reduce his expenditures. He has a small retirement account. \nApplicant\u2019s former facility security officer, who submitted Applicant for a top\nsecret clearance, has known him professionally and personally for eleven years.\nApplicant has never had any incidents involving a security problem. He characterized\nApplicant as a family man who was deeply committed to his marriage. His wife and\ndaughter were his priority and he struggled for many years with his wife\u2019s medical\nissues and the financial strain that ensued. Applicant discussed his financial situation\nwith his security officer during the initial paperwork for the clearance. He explained that\nhe was trying to keep his family together and please his wife. Applicant acknowledged\nthat he made some financial mistakes and has been actively trying to rectify them. His\nformer security officer highly recommends Applicant and has no doubt as to his ability to\nmaintain a clearance (Tr. 62).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n4\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n5\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nAG \u00b6 19(b) \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic\nplan to pay the debt\u201d is another disqualifying condition. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns. Applicant\naccumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts for a period of time. The evidence\nis sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties are actively being addressed. This potentially mitigating condition\napplies in part. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s separation,\ndivorce and his wife\u2019s medical problems all contributed to his financial difficulties. He did\nhis best to support his family with one income and provided for his family. He helped his\nwife pay on her taxes when they were married. He sought guidance and help through a\ndebt network plan in 2005. He acted responsibly given his difficult situation. I find this\nmitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant completed financial counseling. He is following a\nbudget and changing his financial habits. He addressed the delinquent debt as soon as\nhe was able. He has continued to follow a plan and keep current with his bills. I\nconclude these mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\n\n6\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, intelligent\nman. He has worked in his field for many years and has held a security clearance since\n1997. He has received praise for his dedication to his work and his family.\nApplicant was candid and forthright at the hearing. He was organized in his\npresentation. He is on the right track and is resolving his debts. He had circumstances\nin his marriage with his wife\u2019s illness that were beyond his control. He acted responsibly\nand continues to maintain his firm resolve to pay his debts. He acknowledge that he has\nstudent loans and other debt that he is paying on at this time. He has gone to great\nlengths in the past years to rectify his financial situation. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on July 28, 2008, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on August 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 16, 2008,\nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on October 20, 2008, in Woodland Hills,\nCalifornia. \n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 9, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through G. All\nof Applicant\u2019s exhibits  were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr) on October 28, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record\nopen until October 27, 2008, to submit additional documents.  He timely submitted a\ncover letter, and three additional documents, which have been marked as Exhibits H\nthrough K, respectively, and entered into evidence without objection. The record closed\non October 27, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nPrior to the admission of evidence, the SOR was amended because there had\nbeen a clerical  error, which manifested itself in two separate allegations of paragraphs\n1.c. and 1.d. Therefore the allegations have been renumbered, and they now are listed\nfrom 1.a. through 1.o, rather than 1.a. through 1.m., as originally alleged in the SOR. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations: 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g.,\nand 1.k., and he denied all of the other allegations. The admitted allegations are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 49 years old. He is married, and he and his wife have four sons. \nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 14 allegations of overdue debts totaling $19,450, 1.a. through 1.o.,\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order\nas they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,477. Applicant\ntestified that this overdue debt resulted from unpaid rent for an apartment from which he\nwas eventually evicted.  He contacted the creditor for this debt, but he has not made\nany payments to resolve this debt, because he did not have the funds available to make\na down payment on this debt. \n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $166. Applicant\ntestified that this is a valid debt, but no action has yet been taken from Applicant to\nresolve this debt.  \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,496. Applicant\ntestified that this overdue debt resulted from unpaid rent for an apartment from which he\nwas eventually evicted.  He contacted the creditor for this debt, but he has not made\n\n3\nany payments to resolve this debt, because he did not have the funds available to make\na down payment on this debt. \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $422. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit D shows that this debt was paid from the\nproceeds of a sale of Applicant\u2019s home on October 14, 2004. This debt has been\nresolved.\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,866. Applicant\ntestified that this bill is for a vehicle that was repossessed in 2006, and it has not been\nresolved. \n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $166.  Applicant\u2019s did\nnot recall the origination of  this debt, but it appears to be the same debt as 1.b., above.\nI will not consider this debt that this debt is owed, since it has been reviewed in 1.b.,\nabove.  \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,274.  Applicant\ntestified that he is making monthly payments of $30 to pay off this debt. Exhibit F\nestablishes that Applicant has thus far paid $420 on this debt.\n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $64. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit D shows that this debt was paid from the\nproceeds of a home sale  on October 14, 2004. This debt has been resolved.\n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $193.  Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit D shows that this debt was paid from the\nproceeds of a home sale on October 14, 2004. This debt has been resolved.\n1.j. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $759.  Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit D shows that this debt was paid from the\nproceeds of a home sale on October 14, 2004. This debt has been resolved.\n1.k. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $364.  Applicant\ntestified that he contacted the creditor for this debt, but he has not made any payments\nto resolve this debt, because he did not have the funds available to make a down\npayment on this debt. \n1.l. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $191. Applicant\ntestified that he believed that he had paid this is medical bill, but he was not sure and he\nhad no documentation to prove it.  I can not find that this debt has been resolved.\n1.m. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $404.  Applicant\ntestified that this medical bill has been paid. Exhibit D shows that this debt was paid\nfrom the proceeds of a home sale on October 14, 2004. This debt has been resolved.\n\n4\n1.n. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $727.  Applicant\ntestified that this medical bill has been paid. Exhibit D shows that this debt was paid\nfrom the proceeds of a home sale on October 14, 2004. This debt has been resolved.\n1.o. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $56.  Applicant\ntestified that this medical bill has been paid. Exhibit D shows that this debt was paid\nfrom the proceeds of a home sale on October 14, 2004. This debt has been resolved.\nApplicant explained that he and his wife have struggled with their finances at\ndifferent times during their marriage. At one point in 2006, his wife lost her job, and she\ncould not work for a period of time because of illness. Applicant also received a\nreduction in pay when he job was eliminated and he had to take another position within\nthe company. \nApplicant also had financial problems, because his son was arrested, and\nApplicant had to pay for his bail. His one son is now incarcerated, but he still supports\nhis other three sons.  \nApplicant appears to be timely with his current debts. He has no credit cards, and\nhas only one older model vehicle, which has been paid for. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s is\nworking a second to job to have increased income and his wife is working full time\nHowever, during his testimony, he conceded that he does not have much left each\nmonth after paying his debts, and he is barely scraping by.   \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay much of these debts. While he was able to pay off some of his debts in\n2004, from the sale of his home, since then he has only made payments of $30 a month\non one of his other overdue debts, and at this time he still has more than $16,000 of\nlong overdue debt, with little apparent opportunity to pay off these debts.  The evidence\nis sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose in part from Applicant\u2019s wife losing her job for a period.\nHowever, I can not find that this Mitigating Condition applies since Applicant has not\nacted responsibly, because, with the exception of those debts that he resolved in 2004,\nhe has not yet begun to make a good faith effort to resolve and repay all of the other\noverdue debts.\n l find that Applicant is not yet financially sound and prepared for future\ncontingencies. I conclude that he has not mitigated the financial concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why Mitigating Condition (b) does not apply, considered with Applicant\u2019s\ninability to resolve the significant amount of overdue debt, I find that the record evidence\nleaves me with considerable questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through o:\nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s background Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1975 and served six years before his discharge in 1981 (see ex. 2). Following his discharge, he continued to serve in the inactive Army reserves. He completed his inactive reserve duty in 1997 (ex. 1), and received an honorable discharge in recognition of his 23 years of military service (R.T., at 55). He has completed college credits (R.T., at 47-49) and received satisfactory grades for his work. Applicant married his first spouse (W1) in 1979 and divorced her in April 1990.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn July 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to\ndetermine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 21, 2008 and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on August 26, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nOctober 8, 2008.  A hearing was held on October 8, 2008, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted\nof three exhibits; Applicant relied on three one witnesses (including himself) and no\nexhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on December 12, 2008.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified\ninformation is denied.\nDecember 30, 2008\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\nProcedural Issues and Rulings\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to keep the record\nopen to enable to supplement the record with a more legible copy of his Department of\nVeterans Affairs (VA) medical records and update from his current VA treating physician\n(Dr. A).  For good cause shown, Applicant was afforded two weeks to December 17,\n2008 to supplement the record.  Applicant did not supplement the record.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline I, Applicant is alleged to have (a) been treated for post traumatic\nsyndrome disorder (PTSD) by the VA since at least 2003 and (b) been diagnosed in May\n2008 by Dr. B with PTSD with psychiatric features, which in Dr. B\u2019s professional opinion\ncould cause a significant defect in judgment and reliability.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (i) been terminated in December\n1997 from a postal authority due to two cited incidents that occurred during Applicant\u2019s\nemployment probation and (ii) been employed by 10 different employers since 1997.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. He\nprovided no explanations or affirmative claims in his answer.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old security guard for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1975 and served six years before his\ndischarge in 1981 (see ex. 2).  Following his discharge, he continued to serve in the\ninactive Army reserves.  He completed his inactive reserve duty in 1997 (ex. 1), and\nreceived an honorable discharge in recognition of his 23 years of military service (R.T.,\nat 55).  He has completed college credits (R.T., at 47-49) and received satisfactory\ngrades for his work.\nApplicant married his first spouse (W1) in 1979 and divorced her in April 1990.\nHe has two children and a grandchild from this marriage (see exs. 2 and 3; R.T., at 43).\nApplicant married his second spouse (W2) in June 1990.  He currently lives with W2, his\ntwo daughters, and his one grandchild.\nApplicant\u2019s Army reserve unit was activated for the Gulf War in 1989.  Applicant\nserved in the Gulf War theater as an Army MP between 1989 and 1990 (R.T., at 57-58).\nSeveral years following his return from his Gulf War service he began experiencing\ndreams about Iraq (R.T., at 58-59).  As these dreams intensified, he sought medical\nassistance at a VA facility (R.T., at 59-60).  At the VA, he was treated for PTSD and\nother psychiatric symptoms (see ex. 3; R.T., at 59-61).  \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nApplicant\u2019s VA medical records cover his treatment at the VA between May 2003\nand October 2006.  Applicant\u2019s psychiatric difficulties include PTSD symptoms (including\nintrusive memories, nightmares, insomnia, flashbacks, hyperarousal, hypervigilance,\navoidance, paranoia and depression). VA records also reveal Applicant\u2019s history of\nauditory hallucinations of people calling his name and visual illusions (see ex. 3). \nIn 2000, he was diagnosed with PTSD with psychotic features.  In the periodic\nevaluations he has received from the VA, he has consistently been diagnosed with\nPTSD with prominent symptoms of paranoia, visual hallucinations, and anxiety, along\nwith the indicated possibility of an underlying psychotic process separate from his PTSD\ndisorder (see exs. 2 and 3).   More recently, his current mental health providers affiliated\nwith the VA confirmed that Applicant continued to suffer from PTSD with psychotic\nfeatures, along with a history of chronic intermittent psychosis (R.T., at 88-94). \n While able to work as a security guard (according to his medical records), he still\nreports more distress and paranoia and other observed psychiatric symptoms (see ex.\n3).  His latest assessments reveal significant improvement (viz., no flashbacks or\nnightmares and decreased anxiety). His current VA treatment plan calls for continued\nmedications prescribed by his treating physicians (Drs. B and D).  \nIn an October 6, 2006 memorandum, Applicant\u2019s then-treating VA physician (Dr.\nC) found Applicant to have a somewhat brighter affect, with more spontaneous speech\n(see ex. 3).  Dr. C credited Applicant with benefitting from his current medication regimen\nat the time, and did find Applicant to present no acute risk of harm to himself or others\n(see ex. 3).  However, Dr. C did not find any basis to change either Applicant\u2019s diagnosis\nor prognosis in the future.\nStill concerned about Applicant\u2019s mental health, Applicant\u2019s command referred\nhim to Dr. A (a licensed clinical psychologist) in May 2008 for a compulsory mental\nhealth examination.  At the outset of his psychological session with Applicant, Dr. A took\nsome background information from Applicant.  Dr. A then reviewed Applicant\u2019s VA\nrecords and PTSD diagnosis before conducting an interview and administering a mental\nhealth examination (ex. 2). According to Dr. A\u2019s evaluation, Applicant\u2019s evaluation\nconsumed approximately four to five hours and consisted of questioning and testing\n(R.T., at 63-64).  Applicant considers Dr. A\u2019s assessments to be biased and not\nindicative of what kind of person he really is (R.T., at 64).\nIn his interview with Dr. A, Applicant described his various conditions.  In addition\nto his PTSD, he suffered from high blood pressure, diabetes, acid reflux, a dislocated\ndisc in his back, anemia and lung disease (ex. 3).  Applicant identified the following\nmedications he is taking for his various medical conditions, including Quetrapine for a\npsychic disorder, Oxycodine for pain, Citaloprain for depression, Metformin for diabetes,\nand Hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure (see ex. 3).  He also takes Seroquel to\naid his sleep (R.T., at 51).  His medications are seldom adjusted, and he feels they have\nhelped to stabilize his emotional conditions (R.T., at 84-87).\nDr. A administered a separate mental health examination. He observed\nApplicant\u2019s affect to be dysphoric and his mood depressed (in part over his loss of a\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nsecurity job of four years).  Dr. A found Applicant\u2019s psychomotor movements to be mildly\nretarded.  Applicant informed Dr. A of his PTSD condition and his problems with sleep\nand nightmares.  He described the voices he heard and flashes he detected from time to\ntime (ex. 3).  Dr. A credited Applicant with fair short term memory recall and poor\nconcentration.  Overall, Dr. A estimated Applicant to function within a low normal range\nof cognitive ability.\nBesides the medical history he obtained from Applicant and mental examination\nhe performed on the subject, Dr. A administered two separate tests to Applicant.  On the\nBeck Depression Inventory, Applicant recorded a BDI rating of 12, indicating a mild\nmood disorder (consistent with someone like Applicant who takes anti-depressant\nmedication).  In a second test, Dr. A administered the Minnesota Multi-plastic Personality\nInventory.  Results of this test confirmed the following: Applicant numbs his feelings with\nstress; he feels alienated, is disorganized in his thinking; he has interpersonal\nrelationship difficulties; he feels broken and/or damaged and unlovable; he has impaired\nreality testing; he has communication difficulties; and he habitually exercises poor\njudgment (see ex. 3).\nBased on his compiled interview data and review of Applicant\u2019s medical records,\nDr. A found Applicant to have mild cognitive impairments.  Citing his observations of\nApplicant, review of Applicant\u2019s medical history and medications, mental health\nexamination, and administered tests, Dr. A diagnosed Applicant PTSD with psychotic\nfeatures on the Axis I scale of the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Assoc. (2005)).  Dr. A\ndeferred any diagnosis on the Axis II scale and noted Axis IV stressors to include\nunemployment and moderate familial disruption (see ex. 3).  Dr. A opined that\nApplicant\u2019s illness (a)  is of a continuing nature, (b) has and is causing a significant\ndefect in judgment and reliability with a poor prognosis for improvement, \u00a9) and is a\ncondition that is not in remission (ex. 3).\nSince 1997 Applicant has worked for 10 different employers for mostly periods of\nshort duration (see ex. 1; R.T., at 45-46).  There is no probative showing, though, that\nApplicant showed a lack of judgment and reliability in any of these individual employs\n(R.T., at 75-78).  While he freely admits to being terminated for cause by a postal\nemployer after the second of two vehicle accidents involving the truck he used in making\nhis work deliveries (R.T., at 68-73), he provides no probative indicators of reckless or\ncareless behavior.\nApplicant assures he was not culpable in either of the two cited incidents and\nreported each to his employer (R.T., at 68-73).  While a cause and effect relationship\nbetween his two identified incidents and his eventual termination is evident based on the\nfacts presented, the evidence in balance does not establish that Applicant acted\nrecklessly or carelessly in either of the incidents.\nApplicant\u2019s coworkers find Applicant to be reliable and trustworthy (R.T., at 29-30,\n39-40).  One coworker assures that Applicant is in good standing with his union and has\nnot had any grievances filed against him (R.T., at 38).  While on active duty, Applicant\nreceived various awards recognizing his service contributions (R.T., at 56).\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nPsychological Conditions\nThe Concern: Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair\njudgment, reliability or trustworthiness.  A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required for\nthere to be a concern under this guideline.  A duly qualified mental health professional\n(e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved by\nthe U.S. government, should be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference concerning the\nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of seeking mental health\ncounseling.  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 27.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability\nto protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate\nwith the security clearance process. \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant presents as an experienced and well regarded security guard with a\nlengthy medical history of PTSD with psychotic features that begin manifesting during\nApplicant\u2019s Gulf tour of duty in 1991.  Applicant has been treated at the VA fore his\ndisorder for over five years.  His compiled medical records from the VA and more recent\nevaluation by a licensed psychologist engaged by DoD confirm the medical impressions\nhe made with his treatment providers assigned to treat him at the Va.  Afforded an\nopportunity to provide an updated diagnosis and more positive prognosis, Applicant failed\nto provide any post-hearing submissions.   His diagnosed disorder raises ongoing security\nconcerns.  Posing initial security concerns as well are Applicant\u2019s termination stemming\nfrom two adverse incidents that occurred during his probationary period in 1997, and the\nmultiple jobs he has held (10 in all) since 1997. \nBeginning in 1991 during his Gulf tour2004, Applicant began experiencing PTSD\nsymptoms (including intrusive memories, nightmares, insomnia, flashbacks, hyper-\narousal, hyper-vigilance, avoidance, paranoia and depression).  He continued to manifest\nthese symptoms years after his return from MP duty in the Gulf.  VA records also reveal\nApplicant history of auditory hallucinations of people calling his name and visual illusions.\nIn 2000, Applicant self-referred himself to the VA for consultation and evaluation.\nFor the ensuing eight years, he was treated by trained VA medical personnel for his\ndiagnosed condition of PTSD with psychotic features.  All of the medical practitioners who\ntreated him at different intervals consistently diagnosed him with PTSD with psychotic\nfeatures.  \nApplicant\u2019s psychological issues\nAppellant\u2019s adverse psychological assessment raises security concerns about his\njudgment and reliability to access classified information.  Applicable disqualifying\nconditions raised by the emotional, mental and personality disorder guideline are DC \u00b6\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\n28(a), \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness\nthat is not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to emotionally\nunstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior,\u201d and DC \u00b6\n28(b), \u201c an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a\ncondition not covered under any other guideline that may impair judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness.\u201d Application of these guidelines, though, requires the assumed\nacceptance of each of the identified medical professionals who evaluated him. \nEach of the covered evaluations by the VA medical specialists and the engaged\nDoD psychologist consistently affirm a PTSD diagnosis with psychotic features for\nApplicant, and offer little promise of his surmounting his disorder, even with the\nmedications he has been receiving to address his multiple symptoms.  Based on the\nrecent evaluations of Dr. A and his treating physicians at the VA (primarily Drs. B, C and\nD), Applicant continues to suffer from a mental disorder (i.e., PTSD with psychotic\nfeatures) that could impact his judgment and reliability. \nWhile Applicant certainly benefits from the various medications he regularly takes\nto stabilize his condition, he continues to exhibit signs in the professional opinions of the\nmental health providers who have evaluated him over the past two years that he\ncontinues to be at risk to judgment or stability lapses that might imperil the safety of his\nemployer or larger security interests of the nation.  Afforded an opportunity to provide\nmore positive evidence of progress with his disorder, he failed to do so.\nBased on a thorough review of Applicant\u2019s produced medical records to date in this\nrecord, Applicant is not in a position to claim any of the benefits of the mitigating\nconditions of the psychological conditions guideline.  Neither MC \u00b6 29(a), \u201cthe identified\ncondition is readily controllable with treatment, and the individual has demonstrated\nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan,\u201d, MC \u00b6 29(b), \u201c the individual\nhas voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program for a condition that is\namendable to treatment, and the individual is currently receiving counseling or treatment\nwith a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional,\u201d MC \u00b6 29\u00a9)\n \u201crecent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by, or\nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. government that an individual\u2019s previous\ncondition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or\nexacerbation,\u201d or MC \u00b6 29(e), \u201cthere is no indication of a current problem,\u201d has any\napplicability to Applicant\u2019s diagnosed disorder and the treatment he is receiving to\nstabilize his condition.   \nWhole person assessment of Applicant\u2019s medical disorder and steps he has taken\nto neutralize risks of judgment relapses is not sufficient either to avert still active risks of\nserious lapses associated with his disorder.  Without more persuasive medical data to\nestablish good remission and a promising prognosis, it is simply too soon to make safe\npredictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to withstand risks of potential judgment and\ntrust lapses associated with his diagnosed disorder. Taking into account all of the\ncompiled accounts and evaluations in this administrative record,  both from a proof and\ncurrent relevance context, Applicant fails to carry his evidentiary burden at this time, and\nunfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the guideline covering psychological\nconditions.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nPersonal Conduct issues\nPersonal conduct issues raised over Applicant\u2019s (a) prior employment termination\nas the result of two accidents he had with his work vehicle and (b) assortment of\nemployers he has had over the past eleven years (10 in all) are insufficiently developed to\nestablish any sufficiently probative links to judgment lapses covered by the personal\nconduct guideline to substantiate the allegations in the SOR.  While both his two\naccidents and work history may suggest some work-related deficiencies they do not\nwithout more reflect lapses linked to his diagnosed disorder or security-related problems\nthat are necessarily implicit in his work history. Coworkers who have worked with\nApplicant find him both reliable and trustworthy in his security assignments.  And the\nevidence does not contain any documented reports of adverse information relative to\nApplicant\u2019s employment endeavors.\nConsidering all of the evidence and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nemployment history, there is not enough to substantiate judgment and reliability\ndeficiencies under the personal conduct guideline.  Favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by the personal conduct guideline.  \nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the factors enumerated\nin the preamble of Appendix 8 of Regulation 5200.2-R and the Personnel Security\nStandards and Procedures Governing Eligibility.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following\nformal findings:\nPSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1a and 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nPERSONAL CONDUCT:\nFOR APPELLANT\nSubparagraphs 2a and 2.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is denied. \n                                          \nRoger C.

On December 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 23, 2008 and\nanswered it on the same day. He requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I\nreceived the case assignment on June 2, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJune 11, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 9, 2009. The\ngovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received into the record\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented Exhibits (AE) A\nJuly 22, 2009\n\n2\nthrough G, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of\nthe hearing on July 16, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 23, 2009, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He denied the allegation in \u00b6 2.a of the SOR, with\nexplanations. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married with\ntwo children. After high school in May 1990, he attended technical school (Tr. 17). He\nhas worked in the telecommunications field for more than 14 years (AE) B. He has been\nemployed with his current employer since October 2000.\nOn January 20, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While\nIntoxicated (DWI). He pled guilty on December 14, 2006 (almost one year later). He was\nfined approximately $1,500 and he was placed on two years probation. The court also\nordered 100 hours of community service. Applicant attended a party on the evening of\nthe arrest. He drank alcohol but does not remember the quantity (Tr. 44).\nOn October 28, 2006, while his 2005 DWI trial was pending, Applicant was\ncharged with DWI and Open Container of Alcohol (GE) 4. Applicant recalled in detail\nthat on the evening of the arrest he was drinking at home. He heard via a police\nscanner that a car hit a horse on a ranch where he keeps his horse (Tr. 30). He drove to\nthe ranch to check on his horse. He had an open container of beer in the car when the\npolice stopped him. He admits that his judgment was poor and that he should have had\nsomeone drive him. He acknowledged that he \u201cprobably had too many beers\u201d to drive\n(Tr. 31). He believes he may have had six or seven beers. This second case was\ndismissed when he pled guilty to the 2005 DWI. \nApplicant attended \u201clife skills classes\u201d as required by the court. He also attended\nalcohol education classes after the second arrest for DWI. He did not receive any\nalcohol counseling. He successfully completed his probation on December 14, 2008\n(AE) E. His Order of Dismissal, dated January 6, 2009, confirms that he paid all fines\nand costs.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in February 2008 (GE) 1. In\nresponse to Section 23. Your Police Record, concerning alcohol-related charges, he\nresponded \u201cyes\u201d and listed a January DWI. He did not disclose the October 2006\ncharge for DWI. He testified at the hearing that this was his first security clearance\napplication and he misunderstood the question. He completed his first security\nclearance application on line. He testified that this was an honest mistake. He explained\nthat since he was only convicted of the first DWI (2005) and the second (2006) was\ndismissed at the court appearance, he did not feel this incident needed to be reported\n(GE) 2. \n\n3\nApplicant acknowledges his past mistakes. He realizes the impact that the two\nalcohol-related incidents had on his life. He admits to bad decisions. He believes he has\nchanged after his second DWI and will make better decisions. When questioned by\nDepartment Counsel, Applicant acknowledged that when he completed his security\nclearance application, he thought that due to dismissal of the second DWI case, there\nwas nothing to report. He realizes that he did not consider the question carefully. He\nnow understands that \u201ccharged\u201d and \u201cconvicted\u201d are different terms (Tr. 22).\nApplicant drinks in a more moderate manner since the 2006 incident. He\nestimates that he drinks to intoxication (six beers) once a month (Tr. 34). He may drink\none or two beers a week. Applicant does not drink and drive (Tr. 48). \nApplicant is a highly skilled field services technician. He is a knowledgeable,\ndependable and responsible team member. He completes complex tasks with little or no\ndirection (AE) C. He is a family man who is involved with his wife and children. Applicant\nvolunteers in many civic activities. He is organized, efficient and extremely competent\n(AE) D.\nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor considers him a proven asset to the company. He is\nan integral part of the team. He is reliable, trustworthy and ethical. He works hard and\ndisplays great initiative and enthusiasm. He volunteers with emergency response teams\nin times of natural disasters (AE) A. \nApplicant\u2019s performance rating for mid-year 2008 earned him a bonus. He was\nrated outstanding or strong in all areas of his evaluation (AE) F. He completed his goals\nand received a bonus for his annual evaluation (AE) G.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n4\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\n\n5\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\nApplicant did not disclose his alcohol-related arrest in 2006 on his security\nclearance application. He answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question concerning his police record\nwith alcohol but only listed the January 2005 DWI. He misunderstood the question and\nbelieved that since the second DWI was dismissed at the time of the first conviction,\nthere was nothing to report. He was credible in his testimony that he had no intent to\ndeceive the government. Thus, AG \u00b616(a) and 16(b) do not apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant has two alcohol-related driving incidents on his record. He was arrested\nin January 2005 for a DWI and while the case was pending, he was arrested for another\nDWI in October 2006. He acknowledges that he had been drinking too much to drive in\nOctober 2006. Applicant was convicted of the first DWI in December 2006. The second\ncase was dismissed. Applicant received two years of probation beginning in late 2006.\nThis is sufficient to raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c).  \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\n\n6\nApplicant has not had any alcohol-related incidents since 2006. He is sorry for\nthe incidents and the effect on his family. He has a very good work record. His employer\nrecommends him. He successfully completed his probation in late 2008.\nApplicant has not provided sufficient mitigation under this guideline. The last\nalcohol-related incident occurred in October 2006 while Applicant\u2019s 2005 DWI was\npending. He recently completed his probation in late 2008. There have not been any\nother instances but under the circumstances it is too soon for mitigation. He continues\nto consume alcohol to intoxication. Future alcohol-related offenses are likely to occur.\nHis continued excessive alcohol consumption casts doubt on his reliability,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment. Thus, AG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) do not apply in this case. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a married man with a\ngood employment record. He completed his first security clearance application and did\nnot disclose his 2006 DWI incident. He was credible in his explanation that he\nmisunderstood and did not believe he needed to list the incident. He recorded his 2005\nDWI on the application.\nApplicant was stopped for DWI in October 2006 while his first DWI in 2005 was\npending. He admits this DWI was a bad decision. He admits that he had been drinking\ntoo much and should not have driven in October 2006. He just recently completed his\nprobation. The Court dismissal was adjudged January 6, 2009. He continues to drink to\nintoxication once a month. He has received alcohol awareness classes but has not\nreceived any alcohol counseling. I have doubts as to his judgment and reliability at this\ntime.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\n\n7\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from\ncriminal conduct. He has mitigated the concern from personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On September 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 29, 2008. She requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on January 8,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 13, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on February 4, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1-3,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified in her own behalf. She\nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A-B which were admitted into the record. I held the record open\nFebruary 27, 2009\n\n2\nuntil February 24, 2009, for any documents that Applicant wished to submit. Applicant \nsubmitted three documents, which were marked as AE C, D, and E. The record closed\non February 24, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on February 12,\n2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated October 29, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m of the SOR. She provided additional\ninformation to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1979, and attended college on a part time basis. She obtained her\ncollege degree in 2006. She has worked for her current employer since June 2006 (GE\n1). She held a security clearance until the recent revocation.\nApplicant married in 1986 and separated from her husband approximately 16\nyears ago. She received a final divorce approximately 13 years ago. She has two\ndaughters from the marriage. Since her divorce, Applicant has worked and provided for\nher daughters as a single parent. Although she has worked her entire adult life, her\nemployment included many lower paying positions and in general she has been\nunderemployed through no fault of her own.\nApplicant moved several times in order to procure better employment. She\nmanaged a small business and various restaurants. She admitted that during this time\nshe maintained herself financially but she used credit cards extensively (Tr. 16).\nIn 1999, Applicant moved to her home state so that her family could provide\nsome emotional support and help care for her daughters while she worked. Her career\noptions were fewer in that state. She struggled to find good paying positions. Again,\nApplicant admitted that she made some poor financial decisions. She used credit cards\nto pay for daily expenses. \nIn 2006, Applicant obtained her current full time employment with a defense\ncontractor. She was earning a decent salary. She admits that she overextended herself\nby renting a house that was too expensive and by buying an expensive car (Tr. 17). She\nwas maintaining and paying her current expenses. She acknowledged that she was not\npaying on the debt that she incurred prior to 2006.\nIn 2007, Applicant decided to repay her debt. She settled a Sears account for\n$2,698. She also settled a debt that she had with Household Bank for $1,800. Her credit\nreport confirms that the Sears account is paid (GE 3). \nApplicant\u2019s single daughter, 19 years-old, lived with Applicant. She was\nfinancially independent and paid her car insurance, car payment and various personal\n\n3\nexpenses. Applicant provided room and board. In December 2007, Applicant learned\nthat her daughter was seven months pregnant. Applicant\u2019s daughter had medical\nproblems during the pregnancy that prevented her from working. Thus, Applicant was\nnow responsible for her daughter\u2019s bills. After Applicant\u2019s grandchild was born in\nFebruary 2008, her daughter could not find any employment. Applicant is now\nfinancially responsible for her daughter and grandchild. Applicant claimed them as\ndependents for tax purposes (AE A). Since Applicant was paying her bills as well as her\ndaughter\u2019s bills and paying for the baby, she had no money left to repay her delinquent\ndebt. \nThe SOR alleged delinquent debts, including a vehicle repossession, a trailer\nhome repossession and credit card bills. The total amount of delinquent debt was over\n$42,000. Applicant now owes approximately $38,652 (GE. 3).\nApplicant admitted that the accounts in allegations \u00b6 1.a through 1.m are\ndelinquent accounts. She also acknowledges that they are not paid except for the one\naccount with Household Bank (referenced above) in allegation 1.l.  \nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $2,490. After her monthly expenses,\nshe has nothing left. She is behind in her utility bills. She has a credit card that she has\nmaxed out. She borrowed money from her mother to have work done on her car. She\ndeferred her student loans but the deferral period is exhausted. She also borrowed\nmoney recently from a family member to pay some expenses (Tr. 33). She has\nborrowed against her retirement account (Tr. 39). Applicant does not want to file for\nbankruptcy. She is nervous that it will have a negative effect on her job. She wants to\ntake responsibility for her debts and pay them (Tr. 36).\nApplicant registered for a one-day seminar on \u201cWomen and Money\u201d (AE B). She\nintends to follow this up with a budget counselor. She wants to learn to use a budget\nand improve her financial management skills (Tr. 23). Applicant is more realistic at this\npoint. She did not buy a new car when her vehicle was stolen in January 2008. She and\nher daughter share the same car.\nApplicant\u2019s plan is to use her tax refund of $6,400 wisely. She had already filed\nand expects her refund shortly (AE A). She hopes to pay her insurance for six months\nand to pay other current bills. She wants to consolidate her student loans (Tr. 51).\nApplicant\u2019s employer highly recommends her for a security clearance (AE C). Her\ndirect supervisor considers her a \u201cfantastic asset.\u201d Her key strengths are an ability to\nadapt quickly, and learn and process new tools for use directly in various programs. She\nis honest, forthright and has the highest ethical standards. She is trustworthy in\nprotecting sensitive data.\nApplicant is a subject matter expert in the company. She is an excellent\nengineering leader. She has been very reliable and is trusted with program and\ncompany material. She is a mentor to junior members of her team (AE D).\n\n4\nApplicant is consistently described as a key asset to the company. She has been\ninstrumental in supporting very unique and complex contractual requirements. Her\nastuteness, dependability and moral judgment have been demonstrated time and again.\nShe has served in the defense industry for over 30 years (AE E).   \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts. She\nadmits that she did not meet her financial obligations from 2000 until the present with\nthe exception of two accounts. Her credit reports confirm that she has recent debts as\nwell. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in approximately 2000. She accumulated some delinquent debt\ndue to an admitted use of credit cards. While those circumstances may have\nprecipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. She has not acted\nresponsibly. She has approximately $30,000 in delinquent debt. This potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant reported that her daughter became pregnant and had a child in 2008.\nApplicant\u2019s daughter lived with her and Applicant supported her and her grandchild. Her\ndaughter is still living with her. Due to the fact that her daughter could not work,\n\n6\nApplicant paid her daughter\u2019s bills. She could not keep paying on her own delinquent\ndebt. Applicant\u2019s situation may have started due to underemployment after her\nseparation and divorce, and may have initially started a downturn for her. It did impact\non her ability to pay other debts. She also related that she overextended herself when\nshe was working. After she became gainfully employed, she did not act as responsibly\nas she could have in identifying and resolving these debts. She admits making poor\nfinancial decisions. I find this mitigating condition partially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. She\nregistered for a seminar on fiances for women and then plans to get help to manage her\nfinancial problems. She promised to use her tax refund to pay on recent expenses and\nsome debt. Her promises to pay in the future do not constitute evidence of financial\nreform or resolution of debts.  I conclude these mitigating conditions partially apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s marriage ended in separation and\ndivorce. She raised her two daughters as a single parent. She worked but was\nunderemployed for many years. She moved to procure better jobs but overextended\nherself with credit cards. Applicant has a long history of financial difficulties and has not\nresolved many debts that occurred after her gainful employment. She admitted that she\nhas no handle on her finances and that she overextended herself with her credit cards.\nHer recent efforts are not sufficient for her to meet the burden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\n\n7\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nFebruary 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 4, 2008; answered it on September 9, \n2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on September 12, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nSeptember 29, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on November 25, 2008. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on November 28, 2008, scheduling the hearing for December \n15, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and \npresented the testimony of two witnesses. The record closed upon adjournment of the \nhearing on December 15, 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 22, \n2008. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Iran (Hearing Exhibit I). I took administrative notice as requested by Department \nCounsel, with no objection by Applicant. The facts administratively noticed are set out \nbelow in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.e, \nand she admitted the remaining allegations in the SOR. Her admissions in her answer \nand at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old email and system administrator for a defense \ncontractor. She has worked for her current employer since December 2002. She does \nnot have a security clearance (Tr. 8).  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iran and came to the U.S. in 1977 (Tr. 30). She completed \nhigh school in 1978, and attended college in the U.S., and she received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in interior design in 1983. She also received a diploma from a computer training \ncenter in the U.S. in October 1992. She has worked continuously as a contractor for \nvarious federal agencies since March 1993.  \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in May 1996. She was married in July 2002 to a \nnative of Iran who has been a U.S. citizen for about 30 years.  \n \n \nApplicant obtained an Iranian passport in 1998, after becoming a U.S. citizen, \nand used it to visit her family in Iran. Her Iranian passport expired in March 2003, and \nshe renewed it in November 2003, in order to visit her father in Iran after he suffered a \nheart attack (GX 3 at 21). She visited her family in Iran again in October 2006. She \ninformed her employer and her security officer of her travel to Iran (Tr. 34).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Iranian passport expired on March 5, 2008. In response to DOHA \ninterrogatories on May 27, 2008, she declared her intention to renew her Iranian \npassport in order to visit her ailing father if necessary (GX 3 at 3). At the hearing, she \n\n \n3 \n \n \ntestified she did not renew her Iranian passport because she learned it would raise \nissues regarding her eligibility for a clearance (Tr. 40). She testified she would be willing \nto destroy or surrender her expired Iranian passport and to \u201cdenounce\u201d her Iranian \ncitizenship if it is possible (Tr. 34, 40, 43-44). She has no current plans to visit Iran (Tr. \n61). In her closing statement, she referred to Iran as an evil country with an evil \ngovernment (Tr. 60). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, stepmother, one sister, and stepbrother are citizens and \nresidents of Iran. Her father and stepmother are retired and have no relationship with \nthe Iranian government. Her father is 88 years old and in poor health. Applicant testified \nshe left Iran before her father remarried, and she has no relationship with her \nstepmother (Tr. 34). Her stepbrother is a student. He was born after Applicant left Iran, \nand she does not know him (Tr. 34). Her sister is a university graduate but is \nunemployed. She talks to her sister on a regular basis (GX 5 at 3). Her sister intends to \ncome to the U.S. and was scheduled for an immigration interview in January 2009 (Tr. \n35-36).  \n \n \nApplicant applied for a trustworthiness determination in December 1998. On her \napplication, she disclosed her family members in Iran and her travel to Iran in April to \nMay 1998 (GX 1). \n \n \nApplicant also has a sister, two nephews, and a granddaughter who are citizens \nand residents of the U.S. She referred to her husband, sister, and two nephews as her \n\u201cfirst family.\u201d She referred to her two nephews as \u201cmy life\u201d (Tr. 31). All her husband\u2019s \nfamily members are in the U.S. (Tr. 41).  \n \n \nApplicant and her husband own two residential properties in the U.S. Their home \nis worth about $1 million, and they also own a condominium worth about $400,000 (Tr. \n39). They own no property in Iran.  \n \n \nA former employer who is now a family friend testified for Applicant. While she \ndid not hold a security clearance while working for the witness, she was entrusted with \nproprietary information. He described her as very honest and trustworthy (Tr. 48-50). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current manager, who has known her for seven years, described her \nas \u201cwonderful\u201d and his \u201cright-hand person.\u201d She has been entrusted with sensitive \ninformation and has never violated security procedures or compromised any information \n(Tr. 53-54). \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts. Iran is a \ntheocratic Islamic republic dominated by Shia Muslim clergy, with ultimate political \nauthority vested in a learned religious scholar. Iran\u2019s government is hostile to the U.S. \nCurrent U.S. concerns about Iran are based on its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons \nand weapons of mass destruction; support for and involvement in international \nterrorism; support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and its \nhuman rights abuses, including summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrest and \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndetention, and restrictions on civil liberties. Iran has provided guidance, training, and \nweapons to Shia political and militant groups in Iraq. It also provides encouragement, \ntraining, funding, and weapons to anti-Israeli terrorist groups in its efforts to undermine \nthe Arab-Israeli peace process, and it advocates the destruction of Israel. The U.S. has \ndesignated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984, and now regards it as the most \nactive sponsor of terrorism in the world. The U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Iran in \nApril 1980, prohibits most trade with Iran, and uses multilateral sanctions and diplomatic \npressure to contain the threats posed by Iran.  \n \nI have also taken administrative notice that Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Iranian-born, naturalized U.S. citizens are considered solely Iranian citizens \nby the Iranian authorities, and they are required to enter and exit Iran on an Iranian \npassport. While traveling or residing in Iran, they are subject to surveillance, search, \nharassment, arrest, and imprisonment. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Iran and the U.S. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a); she possessed an Iranian passport issued in March 1998 and renewed it \nin November 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and she intends to renew her Iranian passport, which \nexpired in March 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The concern under Guideline C is as follows: \n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country \nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9.  \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999).  \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited \nto \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). A disqualifying condition \nalso may arise from \u201cany statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other \nthan the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(d). Applicant\u2019s possession of an active Iranian \npassport after becoming a U.S. citizen raises AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Her renewal of her Iranian \n\n \n6 \n \n \npassport and use of it to enter and depart Iran after becoming a U.S. citizen raises AG \u00b6 \n10(d). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b610(a)(1) and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n11(a). This mitigating condition is established. Applicant was born in Iran of Iranian \nparents, but she left as a teenager and never returned, except for three visits to her \nfamily in 1998, 2003, and 2006.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on dual citizenship can be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(b). This mitigating \ncondition is established because Applicant testified she is willing to \u201cdenounce\u201d her \nIranian citizenship if it is possible.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be \nmitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). This mitigating condition is established \nbecause Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport has expired, she does not intend to renew it, and \nshe is willing to surrender or destroy the expired passport if necessary. She has refuted \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c that she intends to renew her Iranian passport. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s father, stepmother, sister, and stepbrother are \ncitizens and residents of Iran (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b), and that she traveled to Iran in \n1998, 2003, and 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to Iran was solely to visit her family. Except for the fact that she \nused an Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran, her foreign travel has no independent \nsecurity significance. See ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). The \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family \ntie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). Under \nthe old guidelines, any risk of foreign influence was sufficient to raise a potentially \ndisqualifying condition. The new guidelines require a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d \u201cHeightened \nrisk\u201d is a relative term denoting a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a \nfamily member living under a foreign government. Applicant has no significant contact \nwith her stepmother or stepbrother, but she has contact as well as ties of affection and \nobligation with her father and sister. The requirement for a \u201cheightened risk\u201d in \nApplicant\u2019s case is satisfied by the presence of her father and sister in Iran, the nature \nof the Iranian government, and its hostility towards the U.S.  \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n7(b). The presence of Applicant\u2019s father and sister in Iran is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S. \n \nIran\u2019s hostility to the United States places a \u201cvery heavy burden of persuasion\u201d on \napplicant to overcome the security concerns that are raised when an applicant has \nimmediate family members living in Iran. See ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAug. 4, 2006. With its adversarial stance and its poor human rights record, it is not \nunlikely that Iran would target any citizen in an attempt to gather information from the \nUnited States. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Neither Applicant\u2019s father nor her sister are employed, involved in \nhigh technology industry, or connected to the Iranian government, Nevertheless, \nApplicant cares about her father and sister, and it is not unlikely that Iran would target \nthem in an attempt to exercise indirect influence through them to gather information \nfrom the United States. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty, affection, and sense of obligation toward her father and sister are \nmuch more than \u201cminimal,\u201d but her relationships and loyalties in the U.S. are strong. \nShe came to the U.S. before the Iranian revolution and has never lived under the \ncurrent Iranian regime. She has been a U.S. citizen for more than 12 years, and her \nspouse has been a U.S. citizen for more than 30 years. She has worked as a contractor \nfor various federal agencies for almost 16 years. She has a sister, two nephews to \nwhom she is very attached, and a granddaughter in the U.S. All of her spouse\u2019s family \nare in the U.S. Her sister in Iran is trying to come to the U.S. When Applicant learned \nthat an active Iranian passport raised security concerns, she chose not to renew it. She \nis willing to renounce her Iranian citizenship. All her property interests, which are \nconsiderable, are in the U.S. I am satisfied she would resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a \nforeign country are not casual. ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \nThis presumption applies to Applicant\u2019s contacts with her father and sister, and she has \nnot rebutted it. I conclude Applicant has not met her burden of establishing this \nmitigating condition.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and C in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature woman who has lived all her adult life in the U.S. She \nshares the prevailing U.S. view that the Iranian government is an evil regime. She \npresented herself at the hearing as a thoughtful, intelligent woman. She was sincere, \ncandid, and credible.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and \nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign and foreign preference. \nAccordingly, I conclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Cohen, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. His eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on June 27, 2007. On August 19, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nJune 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a hearing before an  \nadministrative judge. His answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on November 13, \n2008. The case was assigned to me on January 5, 2009. \n \nApplicant and Department Counsel agreed to a hearing date of March 2, 2009. It \nwas necessary to continue the hearing because of inclement weather. The hearing was \nrescheduled for April 6, 2009, and I conducted the hearing as scheduled. \n      \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced 6 exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 6 and admitted to the record without objection. The Government \nprovided for administrative notice general information from the web site of the U.S. \nCourts on the background and general provisions of the Servicemembers\u2019 Civil Relief \nAct and its applicability to bankruptcy, stays of proceedings where the servicemember \nhas notice, and stays or vacation of execution of judgments, attachments and \ngarnishments. I marked this document as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. The Government  also \nprovided for administrative notice excerpts from the statutory law of the State where \nApplicant resided on the applicability of the Servicemembers\u2019 Civil Relief Act to default \njudgments, the enforcement of liens, and the rights, benefits, and protections accruing \nto a servicemember upon call to active duty. I marked the document containing the \nexcerpts from the State statutes as HE 2.  \n \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and called four witnesses, his wife and three \nattorneys who were representing him in various matters. He offered a list of 71 exhibits \nidentified as Ex. A through Ex. SSS. All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits were marked and \nadmitted to the record, with the following exceptions: Exs. BB and QQ were withdrawn \nprior to the hearing and were not further identified; Ex. III, JJJ, and KKK were admitted, \nalthough they contained handwritten notations which Department Counsel did not \nconcede had evidentiary value; sections of Exs. FFF, GGG, and HHH were offered as \nlegal argument and were admitted for whatever limited factual value they might have in \nthis case; and facts in Ex. OO and Ex. NN were admitted for administrative notice. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on April 15, 2009. \n \nPreliminary Matter: Motion In Limine \n \nOn February 27, 2009, Applicant filed a Motion In Limine1 and requested that \none of his witnesses, an attorney with expertise in the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Relief Act of \n \n1The Parties filed the following documents related to Applicant\u2019s Motion In Limine: Applicant\u2019s Motion In \nLimine for Expert Witness to Be Present During Testimony (February 27, 2009); Department Counsel\u2019s \nResponse to Applicant\u2019s Motion in Limine (March 20, 2009); Applicant\u2019s Reply to Department Counsel\u2019s \nResponse to Applicant\u2019s Motion In Limine (April 2, 2009); Department Counsel\u2019s Supplemental Response \nto Applicant\u2019s Motion in Limine (April 2, 2009); Supplement to Applicant\u2019s Reply to Department Counsel\u2019s \nresponse to Applicant\u2019s Motion In Limine (April 3, 2009). These documents are cumulatively identified as \nHE 3 and included in the hearing record.   \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1940 and the Servicemembers\u2019 Relief Act of 2003, be qualified as an expert witness \nand be permitted to be present during the testimony of Applicant and three additional \nwitnesses in order to clarify any facts presented in evidence that would be related to his \nexpert testimony. In making this request, Applicant relied on Rule 703 of The Federal \nRules of Evidence.   \n \nDepartment Counsel opposed Applicant\u2019s Motion in Limine and requested that it \nbe denied. In requesting denial of the Motion, he noted that under The Federal Rules of \nEvidence, legal conclusions and expressions of legal opinions are generally not \nadmissible as expert opinions. Additionally, Department Counsel observed that expert \nwitnesses must offer opinions based on facts that are in record evidence. He stated a \nconcern that the proffered expert witness might offer opinions based on incomplete sets \nof facts and might not address factual matters not included in Applicant\u2019s exhibits, \u201cand \nwhich cannot be reasonably expected to be presented or adduced at a DOHA hearing.\u201d  \n(Department Counsel\u2019s Response to Applicant\u2019s Motion in Limine at 2.) \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, the Parties presented additional oral \nargument regarding Applicant\u2019s Motion in Limine. After hearing their arguments, I \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s witness could appear in the proceeding as a fact witness and \nnot as an expert witness. Accordingly, I denied Applicant\u2019s Motion in Limine.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains ten allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.j.) and two allegations of disqualifying conduct  \nunder AG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.). In his Answer, Applicant denied \nall twelve allegations in the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old and employed as a flight test engineer by a government \ncontractor. He has worked for his present employer for seven years. He holds a \nBachelor of Science degree in Professional Aeronautics and is pursuing a Master of \nScience degree in Aerospace. In 1998, he retired from the U.S. military after 23 \u00bd years \nof service. (Ex. 1; Ex. G; Tr. 289-290.) \n \n \nApplicant has been married twice. He married his first wife in 1971; he and his \nfirst wife divorced in 1996. Applicant married his second wife in 1997. Applicant\u2019s \nsecond wife has had a career in Nursing for approximately 35 years. In 1989, she \nreceived a Master of Science degree in Nursing and is currently a family nurse \npractitioner. After receiving her Master\u2019s degree, she joined a reserve unit of the U.S. \nmilitary. She expects to be promoted to Captain (O-6) in the summer of 2009. (Ex. 1; Tr. \n71, 90-91, 128-129.) \n \n \nOn their personal financial statement, Applicant and his wife report assets \ntotaling $1,986,000, liabilities of $815,000, and a net worth of $1,171,200. Among their \nassets are two farms, a mobile home, and two houses. Their total gross monthly income \nis $27,234, and their total monthly expenses are $13,476. They list monthly contingent \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nliabilities of $8,475. Their total monthly expenses, including contingent liabilities, are \n$21,951. (Ex. A; Ex. B; Tr. 121, 301-304.) \n \n \nSoon after he retired from the military in 1998, Applicant and his wife formed two \ncorporations, one to establish and operate a hardware store and the other to own the \ncommercial real estate where the hardware store was located. Applicant and his wife \nwere the sole shareholders, managers, and owners of the businesses. The businesses \nwere financed by two bank loans with Bank X. One loan, for $360,000, was for the real \nproperty. The second loan, for $700,000, was secured by the hardware store business \nand other real property that Applicant and his wife owned. Both loans were guaranteed \nby the Small Business Administration (SBA) and were personally guaranteed by \nApplicant and his wife. In 1998/1999, during its first year of business, the hardware \nstore had twelve to fifteen employees and made approximately $1.3 million. Applicant \nworked full-time at the business; his wife continued her full-time work as a nurse \npractitioner and worked at the hardware store some evenings and on weekends. (Ex. \nEE; Ex. FF; Tr. 35-36, 74-75, 131, 242-243, 314-315.) \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant acquired two credit card accounts which he used to pay for \nbusiness expenses of the hardware store corporation. After the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, hardware sales fell off, and Applicant experienced financial \ndifficulties with the business. Applicant and his wife asked Bank X to extend additional \ncredit to them, but the bank refused to do so, stating that the real property that Applicant \nhad provided as collateral had diminished in value. Applicant and his wife were unable \nobtain loans from other banks because all of their collateral had been pledged to Bank \nX. The business continued to lose money, and Applicant and his wife found it necessary \nto reduce the number of employees in the business to five or six. In February 2003, \nApplicant took a full-time job with his present employer and he and his wife, who \nremained employed as a nurse practitioner, continued to manage the hardware store. \n(Tr. 35-37;75-80; 329-330.) \n \n \nOn June 13, 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife was called to active military duty, and she has \nserved on continuous active duty in the continental U.S. since that time. By letter dated \nJune 15, 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife wrote to Bank X, cited her call to active military service, \nand requested that interest on the hardware store loan, which was guaranteed by the \nSBA, be reduced to 6% for the duration of her active military service as provided by \nsection 207(a)(1) of the Servicepersons\u2019 Civil Relief Act (SCRA), P.L. 108-189 \u2013 Dec. \n19, 20032. Applicant and his wife also requested that the interest on the commercial \nproperty loan be reduced to 6%, as permitted by SCRA. The bank complied with this \nrequest. By letter dated February 21, 2006, an officer of Bank X notified Applicant and \nhis wife that the SBA had advised the bank that the hardware store loan was not eligible \nfor the 6% interest reduction under SCRA.  The hardware store business closed in April \n2006. On July 13, 2006, the commercial real estate business owned by Applicant and \nhis wife filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. (Ex. GG; Ex. AAA; Ex. OOO; Tr. 75-80.) \n \n \n2 See 50 U.S.C. app. 527. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant and his wife hired a law firm to represent the real estate business in the \nbankruptcy. In July 2006, the law firm filed the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and all \nrelated papers on behalf of the business. It also represented Applicant in negotiating a \nconsent order. Applicant did not believe that the law firm adequately represented his \ninterests regarding SCRA when it negotiated the consent order on his behalf with Bank \nX.3 The bankruptcy court awarded attorneys fees to the law firm. Applicant refused to \npay the law firm\u2019s fees of approximately $24,000. The law firm brought a claim against \nApplicant for its fees, and a warrant in debt action was filed against Applicant on June \n18, 2008. This delinquent debt was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i., and it has not been satisfied. \nApplicant denies the debt and believes the law firm owes him a refund. (Ex. 3 at 15; Ex. \nCCC; Ex. DDD; Tr. 380, 411-412.) \n \n \nThe bankruptcy court found that, before filing his petition in bankruptcy,  \nApplicant had defaulted on two deeds of trust held by Bank X. As of September 27, \n2006, the payoff for the two deeds of trust was in excess of $700,000.  Applicant made \nno payments on the two obligations after filing his petition. On July 24, 2006, Bank X \nfiled a motion for relief from the automatic stay under Chapter 11, which the bankruptcy \ncourt heard and granted in part and denied in part. Applicant was awarded time to try to \nsell the properties and the inventory of the hardware store, which he was unable to do. \nBank X subsequently sold the properties at a sheriff\u2019s sale.4 Applicant was responsible \nfor a deficiency of $358,000, identified at SOR \u00b6 1.h. The bankruptcy was dismissed by \norder of the bankruptcy court dated January 4, 2008. The debt had not been satisfied as \nof June 6, 2008. Applicant does not believe he is legally obligated to pay the debt, even \nthough he personally guaranteed the two deeds of trust. (Ex. VV; Ex. AAA; Tr. 271-272, \n311, 328-329.)   \n \n \nDuring the 4\u00bd year period between September 11, 2001 and the closing of his \nhardware store in April 2006, Applicant encountered numerous business difficulties, \nwhich resulted in additional financial delinquencies alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed two debts to a credit card company, and, \nas of June 6, 2008, these debts had not been satisfied. One debt was for approximately \n$4,247 and the other debt was for approximately $5,379.5 Both debts had been charged \noff by the creditor in July 2004. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.) \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied both debts. The record reflects that, \non April 25, 2005, a check for $378.93 was remitted to the creditor authorizing payment \nfrom the hardware store corporate account for one of the two accounts. The record also \n \n3 Applicant stated that \u201cthe bankruptcy was a vehicle only to get a ruling. . . on the Servicemembers Civil \nRelief Act application\u201d to the hardware store debt and the commercial property business debt.  (Tr. 324.) \n  \n4 Applicant relied on Section 706 (a) and 706 (b) of SCRA to assert his belief that the bank was not \nauthorized to sell his assets and collateral at the sheriff\u2019s sale. See 50 U.S.C. app.596. \n  \n5 Applicant distinguished the two accounts: \u201cOne was the typical [credit card] that you pay off [in] full \nevery 30 days.  The other one . . . was revolving.  You had a minimum monthly payment.\u201d (Tr. 330.)  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nreflects at that in March and April 2005, the creditor gave Applicant formal notice \namending the terms of his small business corporate account to hold him personally \nliable for charges to the account, as follows: \n \nThe Company and the Authorizing Officer are liable to us for all Charges \non the Card Account made in connection with all Corporate Cards. If you \nare a Corporate Cardmember you are liable to us for all Charges made in \nconnection with the Card issued to you, even though we may send bills to \nthe Company and not to you.     \n  \n  \n(Ex. III; Ex. JJJ; Ex. KKK.) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he learned in 2005 that the creditor was holding him \nand his wife personally responsible for the unpaid debts. He denied personal \nresponsibility for the debts and stated: \u201cI do not believe they are the debts [of me and \nmy wife]. They are the debts of [the hardware store]. I attempted to pay [the credit card \ncreditor] morally, as a moral obligation, until I realized that [the credit card creditor] had \narbitrarily taken the debt and moved it to me personally.\u201d (Tr. 219, 329-332, 335.) \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant wrote to the creditor and stated again his opinion \nthat he was not the debtor on the accounts. He stated that the hardware store \ncorporation was responsible for payment of the debts. One of Applicant\u2019s witnesses was \nan attorney he had hired in December 2008 to assist him in dealing with the two credit \ncard debts. The attorney stated that he had advised Applicant that he did not think the \ncredit card company can validly request payment of the debt from Applicant and his \nwife. In February 2009, the attorney wrote again to the credit card company and \ndisputed Applicant\u2019s responsibility to pay the debt. As of the date of Applicant\u2019s hearing, \nthe credit card company had not responded to the attorney\u2019s letter, and Applicant had \ntaken no action to pay or settle the debts. (Ex. K; Ex. QQQ; Tr.199-203, 225-227, 393-\n396.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed his state of residence approximately \n$91,000 in delinquent taxes for 2002 and 2003, and, as of June 6, 2008, the debt had \nnot been satisfied. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.)  In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt.  \n \n \nAn attorney representing Applicant in his state and federal tax matters appeared \nas a witness and identified the state tax delinquencies as sales and withholding taxes \nrelated to the hardware store business. The attorney identified the delinquency \nattributed to Applicant and his wife as a converted assessment. Applicant\u2019s state of \nresidence assesses delinquent business taxes against responsible officers following the \nclosing of a business. Under the principle of converted assessment, the state takes the \ncorporate tax debt, dollar for dollar, and charges it to the responsible officers.  (Tr. 139.) \n \nThe record reflects that in December 2003, Applicant, on behalf of the hardware \ncorporation, signed an agreement with the state to pay the delinquent taxes, beginning \nin January 2004. The terms of the agreement were six monthly payments of $2,500 and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \na balloon payment of $75,000. Applicant made payments of $2,500 on each of the \nfollowing months: January 2004; February 2004; March 2004; April 2004; May 2004; \nand June 2004. Thereafter, he made no more payments. Applicant stated he made \npayments until his wife prepared to enter active duty in June 2005, but the record does \nnot support this statement. He also stated that he stopped making payments because \nthe corporation lacked the money to make the balloon payment of $75,000. (Ex. RRR; \nTr. 347-350.) \n \nOn June 26, 2005, Applicant, on behalf of himself and his wife, wrote to the state \ntaxing authority and reported his wife\u2019s call to active military duty on June 13, 2005. \nRelying on Section 207 of SCRA, Applicant requested that the interest charged on the \npre-existing tax delinquency be capped at the statutory six percent during the time of his \nwife\u2019s active duty service.6  (Ex. O.) \n \nThe record does not contain a reply from the State taxing authority to Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, nor does it reflect any payments made by Applicant after he sent the letter. On \nApril 4, 2007, the State taxing authority served a notice of tax lien and demand for \npayment of state taxes on a bank account in the name of Applicant\u2019s hardware store. \nThe state taxing authority demand letter required that the bank levy \u201call available funds, \nup to the amount due, to the Department of Taxation to pay your debt.\u201d  The demand \nletter identified the tax delinquency debt as $85,212.78. On May 23, 2008, the state \ntaxing authority served the hardware store with a consolidated bill and notice to levy, \nwith the notation that immediate action was required. This letter identified that balance \ndue as $91,235.  Applicant estimates that the delinquent tax, exclusive of interest and \npenalties is approximately $36,000. (Ex. P; Ex.Q; Tr. 166) \n \nBy letter to the state taxing authority dated July 11, 2008, Applicant requested a \nstay of the notice of intent to levy. In support of his request, Applicant cited his wife\u2019s \ncontinuing active duty military service, his preparation of legal action against the bank \nwhich had lent him money to establish his two businesses and which had foreclosed on \nthe business mortgages and sold the business assets pledged as collateral, and what \nhe believed to be his rights and his wife\u2019s rights under section 207 and section 706 of \nSCRA.7 (Ex. R.) \n \nOn August 13, 2008, the state taxing authority replied to Applicant\u2019s request for a \nstay of the notice of intent to levy. The state taxing authority stayed collection activity on \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s portion of the account and stated that it would pursue collection on \nApplicant\u2019s portion of the account. On January 6, 2009, Applicant authorized a law firm \nrepresenting him to file an offer of compromise on his behalf with the state taxing \nauthority and to request thereby a release of the lien. In the offer of compromise, \nApplicant proposed to pay the state taxing authority $30,000 over a period of 36 months \nto satisfy a converted tax assessment for delinquencies dating to tax years 2000 to \n \n6 See 50 USC app. 527. \n \n7 See 50 USC app. 527 and 50 USC app. 596. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n2003. As of the date of Applicant\u2019s hearing, no reply had been received from the state \ntaxing authority to the offer of compromise.  (Ex. S; Ex. T; Tr.145-146.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed the Federal government approximately \n$88,000 in delinquent federal withholding taxes since about December 2004, and, as of  \nJune 6, 2008, the debt had not been satisfied. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.)  In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant denied the debt.  \n \nThe federal tax delinquencies arose when the hardware store business failed to \nwithhold required payroll taxes for its employees. The record reflects that in November \n2005 Applicant contacted the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and offered to pay \nthe hardware store\u2019s outstanding federal tax debt, including penalties and interest, by \nMarch 17, 2006. By letter dated November 29, 2005, the IRS accepted Applicant\u2019s offer \nand identified the total amount due as $147,514.61. The record also reflects that a \nfederal tax lien was filed June 13, 2005 and released May 14, 2008, showing an unpaid \nbalance of assessment of $22,354.15.  In 2008, the IRS assessed the unpaid business \ntax debt against Applicant and his wife personally. Applicant admits to an outstanding \nfederal tax debt of $40,000 to $50,000, minus interest and penalties. (Ex.U; Ex. W; Tr. \n146-147, 359-362.) \n \nOn February 24, 2009, Applicant filed claims with the IRS for refund and requests \nfor abatement of interest and penalties accruing to delinquent employment taxes for tax \nquarters commencing in January 2002 and ending September 2005. Applicant \nsupported his claims for refund and requests for abatement with the following rationale:  \n \n[Applicant and his wife] were assessed penalties and interest \nduring the time that [Applicant\u2019s wife] was called up for active duty. \nPursuant to the SCRA, Public Law 108-189, Section 207, there is a limit of \n6% interest which can be assessed, while someone is in military service. \nAlso, pursuant to SCRA, Public Law 108-189, Section 510, penalties and \ninterest are supposed to be deferred upon request while the taxpayer is in \nmilitary service.   \n \n(Ex. LLL.) \n  \n \nOn February 24, 2009, Applicant also filed claims for refund and requests for \nabatement of interest and penalties accruing to his income taxes for tax years 2003 and \n2004. His arguments in support of his request relied on the rationale expressed above \nin Ex. LLL.  At his hearing, Applicant stated his intention to set up a payment plan for \nthe delinquent employment and income taxes after the IRS adjusts the interest and \npenalties as he requested in his claims for refund and requests for abatement. He \nstated that he had sufficient resources to pay the principal amounts owed. The attorney-\nwitness advising him on his state and federal tax delinquencies stated that, based on \nhis knowledge of federal tax law, Applicant would not waive or forfeit his request for \nabatement if he paid the principal tax debt before receiving a decision on the abatement \nrequest.  (Ex. MMM; Tr. 162-166, 362-363.) \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed delinquent county property taxes that had \nnot been satisfied as of June 6, 2008. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant owed \napproximately $1,459 in delinquent county property taxes for 2004, and SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nalleges that he owed approximately $1,649 in delinquent county property taxes for \n2005. Applicant denied the allegations. He stated that when the bank seized his \nproperty and sold it at a sheriff\u2019s sale, it overpaid all outstanding county property taxes \nby about $5,000. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his statement. \nSchedule E of Applicant\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition lists the 2004 and 2005 \ncounty property tax delinquencies. Applicant\u2019s Ex. AA contains photocopies of five \nchecks made by Applicant and his wife and payable to the county taxing authority. The \nchecks bear the following dates and amounts: October 6, 2008: $1,012.22; September \n15, 2008: $6,397.10; September 11, 2008: $414.32 (specified as payment of 2008 \ntaxes); March 23, 2008: $655 (specified as payment of 2007 taxes); and January 26, \n2008: $2,110. It is unclear from the record whether any of these checks was in payment \nof the 2004 and 2005 delinquencies alleged in the SOR. Applicant stated that the check \nfor $6,397 was for delinquent property taxes owed by the hardware store. He further \nstated that he and his wife personally paid the delinquent corporate taxes with the \nSeptember 15, 2008 check for $6,397. The record contains a letter to Applicant from the \ncounty taxing authority, dated February 17, 2009, which states that real estate taxes for \nthe commercial property company have been paid and no amounts are outstanding and \ndue. (Ex. AA; Ex. KK; Ex. V V; Tr. 365-371.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes a creditor $1,697 on an account delinquent \nsince November 2005. (SOR \u00b6 1.f.)  Applicant acknowledged the debt in response to \nDOHA interrogatories. He was unable to provide further information on the status of the \ndebt or to provide a receipt indicating that the debt had been satisfied. (Ex. 3 at 15; Tr. \n372-377.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed a delinquent debt of $1,075 to the U.S. \nTrustee that presided over his Chapter 11 bankruptcy. (SOR \u00b6 1.j.) Applicant denied the \ndebt, stating that it was not a personal debt but a corporate debt owed by the \ncommercial property company which he and his wife established. He acknowledged that \nthe commercial property company no longer had any assets with which to pay its debts. \n(Ex. 3 at 16; Tr. 390-391.) \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified an e-QIP on June 27, 2007. Section 28a on the \ne-QIP asks: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question at Section 28a.  Section 28b on the \ne-QIP asks: \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the question at Section 28b.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts by responding \n\u201cNo\u201d to the questions at Section 28a and 28b. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.)  Applicant denied \ndeliberate falsification and stated that he answered Sections 28a and 28b correctly as \nan individual. He stated that he did not, as an individual, have any debts that were \n\n \n10 \n \n \ndelinquent over 180 in the past seven years and he did not, as an individual, have any \ncurrent debts that were over 90 days delinquent. (Tr. 391-392.) \n \n \nApplicant did not seek advice from his security officer before answering the \nquestions. He was familiar with the questions posed on security clearance applications \nbecause he had answered such questionnaires many times during his military career, \nand he was confident in deciding for himself how he would answer the questions. When \nhe completed and submitted his security clearance application, he was aware that he \nhad personally guaranteed, and therefore was personally liable for, the business loans.  \nAfter he completed his SF-86, he discussed denial of his SCRA claims with his security \nofficer and provided her with a letter written by a military legal assistance attorney \nrequesting assistance from the Justice Department in the matter. (Ex. CC; Tr. 433-434, \n437-439.) \n \n \n                                                 Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n11 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nThe record reflects that Applicant experienced difficulties in meeting the \nobligations of his businesses in at least 2003, and those difficulties continue to the \npresent time. While Applicant denied all ten allegations of financial delinquency in the \nSOR, the record evidence establishes that the financial delinquencies exist and that \nApplicant initiated and carried out the actions that resulted in the debts alleged. \nApplicant and his wife were the sole responsible financial agents of the two businesses \nthey established.  \n \nApplicant and his wife took out loans, which they personally guaranteed, to \nestablish the two business corporations. A business downturn after September 11, 2001 \nhad a negative affect on the businesses. Applicant was unable to pay the interest on the \nloans he took out to establish the businesses. Moreover, the businesses incurred debts, \nfor which they were responsible and which they did not pay. Additionally, the \nbusinesses were responsible for paying federal, state, and county property taxes, which \nthey also failed to pay. \n   \nThe businesses failed in 2006. After the businesses shut down, creditors, \nincluding state and federal taxing authorities, looked to Applicant and his wife to satisfy \nthe delinquent debts incurred by the businesses. This evidence is sufficient to raise \nsecurity concerns under disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n \nThe guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nSeveral mitigating conditions could apply to Applicant\u2019s case. If the financially \ndelinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply.  If \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts,\u201d the AG \u00b6 20(d) might apply.  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nApplicant established his businesses in 1998. His hardware store business fell off \nafter the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Applicant and his wife acted \nresponsibly by turning to other employment to acquire cash and by reducing the number \nof individuals they employed in the hardware store. They sought to have their interest \npayments lowered under SCRA. However, they allowed their business loans and debts \nof the hardware store business to become delinquent. They did not timely file payroll \n\n \n13 \n \n \ntaxes for their employees. They appeared to have adversarial relationships with most of \ntheir creditors and did not seek, in good faith, to pay or settle their debts.  Some of their \nactions were not responsible under the circumstances.  \n \n  While Applicant admitted the debts existed and that they had been incurred by \ncompanies that he and his wife established and were solely responsible for, he denied \npersonal responsibility for the debts and did not pay them, even though he provided \npersonal financial information that established his present ability to pay or resolve the \ndebts. As an affirmative defense, he asserted he should not be held personally \nresponsible for the corporations\u2019 debts. He also asserted he should not be responsible \nto pay court-ordered debts or debts that he believed did not reflect creditors\u2019 compliance \nwith SCRA. He stated he did not believe he should be personally responsible for paying \nthe delinquent debts and taxes of the corporations, which were no longer in existence. \nFrom his perspective and in his opinion, the debts were unenforceable.  \n \nIn light of his financial situation, Applicant had the burden of presenting evidence \nto demonstrate extenuation or mitigation sufficient to warrant a favorable security \nclearance determination. His assertions that his debts were personally unenforceable \ndo not mitigate security concerns about his judgment and reliability demonstrated by his \nfailure to timely satisfy his substantial unresolved debt. \n \nDOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has concluded that reliance on the unenforceability of a \ndebt does not constitute a good faith effort to resolve the debt within the meaning of the \nDirective. The Appeal Board has noted that \u201ca security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts.  Rather it is a proceeding \naimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nAccordingly, even if a delinquent debt is legally unenforceable under state law, the \nfederal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding an \napplicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 07-09966 at 3 (App. Bd. June 25, 2008).    \n \nApplicant denied responsibility for the financial delinquencies alleged in the SOR. \nIn support of his denials, he asserted affirmative defenses based on his layman\u2019s \nunderstanding of the applicable law. He also presented three attorney-witnesses who \ntestified about the advice they had given him. None of Applicant\u2019s objections to paying \nthe delinquent debts alleged in the SOR has been tested or resolved in a definitive legal \nproceeding. He has the resources to settle or pay his debts should he choose to do so. \n \nApplicant provided documentation to corroborate that he had paid all delinquent \npersonal property taxes owed to his county. County personal property tax delinquencies \nfor 2004 and 2005 were alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.g.  \n \n I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply in mitigation to \nthe facts in Applicant\u2019s case. I also conclude that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part in \nmitigation. \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nWhen he answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions 28a and 28b on the e-QIP he signed and \ncertified on June 27, 2007, Applicant was aware of the several financial delinquencies \nderived from the two businesses he incorporated in 1998. These delinquencies were \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h. Applicant was also aware that he had personally \nguaranteed the loans he had acquired to establish the businesses. Applicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d \nanswers indicate falsification of material facts and raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(a).  AG \u00b6 16(a) reads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  \n \nSeveral Guideline E mitigating conditions might apply in this case.  If Applicant \n\u201cmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct his omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts,\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a) might apply. If \u201cthe refusal or failure \nto cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by \nimproper or inadequate advice of an authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or \ninstructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process\u201d and \n\u201c[u]pon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, \nthe individual cooperated fully and truthfully,\u201d AG \u00b6 17(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe offense \nwas so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c) might \napply. If \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate \nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d) might apply. If \u201cthe \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress,\u201d then AG 17(e) might apply. \n \n \nApplicant denied that he deliberately falsified his answers to questions 28(a) and \n28(b) on the e-QIP he signed and certified on June 25, 2007. He stated that he read the \nquestions carefully, concluded that they applied to him personally, and thus did not \nreport the corporate debts because he did not consider them to be his personal debts. \n \n\n \n15 \n \n \n                                           \n \nWhen he completed the e-QIP in June 2007, Applicant knew that the hardware \nstore business was no longer in existence and at least one creditor had put him on \nnotice that it considered him responsible personally for paying the delinquent debts of \nthe hardware store. He also knew that he had personally guaranteed the loans he \nreceived when he established his hardware store business, and he knew he had \ndefaulted on those loans. He did not seek counsel from his security officer when he \ncompleted his e-QIP. He explained that he had completed security clearance \napplications many times in the past during his military career, and he was confident he \nknew how to answer the questions accurately. He stated that he later provided the \nsecurity officer with documents about his claims under SCRA. He knew that he owed \nlarge sums to various creditors and that the SCRA does not negate his responsibility to \npay the debts. The SCRA permits delay in payment and caps interest payments. The \ndebts still exist, and SCRA does not end Applicant\u2019s responsibility to pay his creditors. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answers to Questions 28(a) and (b) were incorrect. Incorrect answers \nare not the same as deliberately false answers.8 However, when his answers are \nexamined in light of what he acknowledged he knew at the time, the reasons he had for \nnot accepting personal responsibility for his debts, and the motives he might likely have \nto conceal his substantial financial delinquencies from the government, I conclude that \ndirect and circumstantial evidence supports a finding of deliberate falsification. I also \nconclude that none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions applies to the facts of \nAppellant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n \n8 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n \n\n \n16 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nassociated with his business ventures began when he was a mature adult. He was \naware of his financial problems and contested them by denying personal responsibility \nfor them. He is aware that the corporations he established are no longer in business \nand no longer possess assets that can be used to pay or settle debts. He failed to \naccept responsibility for debts he incurred in establishing and operating a business, and \nhe failed to candidly acknowledge and report those debts to the government on his \nsecurity clearance application. \n \nApplicant has taken action, albeit recent, to address his county personal property \ntax delinquencies. At his hearing, he provided documentation corroborating his \nstatement that he is no longer in arrears on his county property taxes. However, these \nactions are recent and do not demonstrate a track record of satisfaction of debt \nconsistently over time. It is not clear that Applicant has accepted his obligations to \ncreditors.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies and personal conduct.  \n \nApplicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after the date of this \ndecision.  If he wishes, he can produce new evidence that addresses the Government\u2019s \ncurrent security concerns.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.: Against  Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n17 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h. through 1.j.: Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 27-year-old truck driver seeking a security clearance. She attended college for a period but does not have a degree. She is married and has no children.1 The SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts, totaling $21,887. Applicant admitted to owing all the debts with the exception of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.m, and 1.r. She stated that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g; the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a; and she denied owing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.m.

DeLaney, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn August 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 18, 2008, and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on October 9, 2008. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nJanuary 15, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on October 15, 2008. As of December \n12, 2008, she had not responded. The case was assigned to another administrative \njudge on December 12, 2008, and reassigned to me on January 8, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old truck driver seeking a security clearance. She attended \ncollege for a period but does not have a degree. She is married and has no children.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts, totaling $21,887. Applicant admitted to \nowing all the debts with the exception of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.m, and 1.r. \nShe stated that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.g; the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a; and \nshe denied owing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.m. After viewing the credit reports, I find \nthat the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, and \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.a.2 \n \n \nApplicant disputed owing the $2,340 judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. She \nindicated that her mother-in-law rented a house and Applicant and her husband stayed \nthere for a period, but they never signed anything and were never on the lease. She \nstated they would dispute it and have it removed from their credit report. The judgment \nwas reported by Experian on the combined credit report of November 2, 2007, which \nlisted a joint judgment of $2,340, filed in December 2002. The judgment is not listed on \nthe Equifax credit report of April 16, 2008. Applicant may believe that she has a \nlegitimate dispute of this debt. However, the evidence establishes the debt was reduced \nto a judgment by court action. Without something additional from the court, I find that \nshe is responsible for this debt.3 \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from about 2001 through September 2006. She \nmarried in 2002. Her husband was also unemployed in 2001. It is unclear how long he \nwas unemployed. During their unemployment many debts became delinquent and \nmedical bills went unpaid because they did not have medical insurance. Applicant and \nher husband became independent contractors in September 2006. They bought a truck \nthrough financing in September 2007. They have paid almost $6,500 in repairs to the \ntruck. She indicated that now that the truck is in good shape, they would start saving \nmoney for future repairs. Once they have a sum saved up for future repairs, she stated \nthey would start paying their delinquent debts. After expenses, which include an \naverage of $587 per month in truck repairs, their combined discretionary income at the \nend of the month is about $70.4 \n                                                          \n1 Item 5. \n \n2 Items 4, 6-8. \n \n3 Items 4, 7, 8. \n \n4 Items 4, 6. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay her \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not made payments on any of the debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is not applicable. Applicant attributes her debts to her and her husband\u2019s \nunemployment. That is a condition that was largely beyond her control. To be fully \napplicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant did not fully explain all the facts surrounding the \nunemployment or what she did during the years of unemployment, and she has not \npresented a firm plan on addressing her delinquent debts. There is insufficient \ninformation for a finding that she has acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is partially applicable.   \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received counseling. There are no clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not \napplicable. She has not made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. Two of the debts are duplicates. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k \nand 1.q are concluded for Applicant. She disputed owing the underlying debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.m, but that debt has been reduced to a legal judgment and she did not produce \ndocumentation to refute the judgment. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.v alleges that Applicant has approximately $722 in discretionary income \nat the end of each month but has made no payments on her delinquent debts. Her \nfamily\u2019s combined discretionary income at the end of the month is actually about $70. \nSOR \u00b6 1.v is concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has more than $19,000 in \ndelinquent debt. She went through a long period of unemployment and her husband \nwas also unemployed. They have purchased a truck and have made a serious \ncommitment to that business. However, she has not submitted sufficient information for \na finding that her financial house is now in order. She has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her numerous delinquent debts. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.u: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e-1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.q, and 1.r of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. 2 Applicant, who is 52 years old, works as an engineering technician for a Department of Defense contractor.

I conclude that\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information must be denied.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (e-QIP), on\nAugust 19, 2007. On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApril 24, 2009\n\nItem 2; Item 3.\n1\nItem 3, supra note 1, and attachments.\n2\nItem 4 (SF-86).\n3\nId.; Item 8.\n4\nItem 9, at 8.\n5\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 17, 2008. He\nsubmitted a notarized, written response to the SOR allegations on December 29, 2008,\nand requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing.1\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on February 2, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nFebruary 9, 2009. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not file response or\nadditional evidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on April 16, 2009. The government\nsubmitted nine exhibits, which have been marked as Item 1-9 and admitted into the\nrecord. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been marked and admitted as Item 3. His\nresponse and attachments to the FORM are admitted into evidence.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his undated Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.h, 1.k-1.p, and 1.t of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,\n1.c, 1.e-1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.q, and 1.r of the SOR. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n2\nApplicant, who is 52 years old, works as an engineering technician for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. He began this position in August 2007. He served in\nthe United States Navy from 1973 until 1996. He held a secret clearance without any\nviolations of procedures. He retired as a Chief Warrant Officer 3. Since his retirement,\nhe has worked as a hazmat supervisor and a home mortgage loan officer. He was\nunemployed for four months in 2000.3\nApplicant married in 1975 and divorced in 1990. He has three children, two\ndaughters ages 31 and 21, and a son, age 23. He also has a stepdaughter, age 37,\nfrom his first marriage. He is not married, but lives with a long-time companion, who\nsustained injuries in a car accident in 2006. He reduced his work hours to care for his\ncompanion.   \n4\nApplicant\u2019s monthly gross income totals $6,250 and his monthly military\nretirement and disability pay totals $3,435. His net monthly income totals $8,720. His\nmonthly expenses total $2,565, leaving $6,155 a month income available to pay debts.5\n\nItem 1; Item 3, supra note 1, with attachments; Item 6, Item 7, and Item 9, supra note 5.\n6\nItem 3, supra note 1; Item 4, supra note 3, at 30-31; Item 6, supra note 6, at 1-2.\n7\nItem 3, supra note 1; Item 8, supra note 4; Item 9, supra note 5.\n8\nSee MCL 600.5807(8); MCL 600.5809(3).\n9\n3\nThe SOR lists 15 debts, 3 judgments and a 2001 Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing,\nbased on the credit reports of record. Applicant denies owing two of the three\njudgments. He also denies owing 7 of the 15 debts. He correctly alleges that the\njudgment in SOR allegation 1.b and the debt listed in SOR allegation 1.q are the same.\nBased on a careful review of the four credit reports of record, I find that the debts in\nthese allegations are the same. Thus, I find that allegation 1.q is a duplicate debt and is\nfound in favor of Applicant.  \n6\nApplicant indicated in his SF-86 that his pay had been garnished to pay the\njudgments identified in SOR allegations 1.b and 1.o. He has not provided information\nwhich shows these debts have been paid as a result of the garnishment. I note that the\njudgment listed in SOR allegation 1.o is not shown on the April 18, 2008 credit report.\nThe other two judgments are on this credit report. The December 8, 2008 credit report\nsubmitted by Applicant lists all three judgments as unpaid.7\nIn his answers to the interrogatories sent by the government, Applicant does not\ndeny owing the debts listed in the SOR; rather, he acknowledges that he had not taken\nany action on the debts listed in the SOR. He indicated that the debts would or had\nbeen removed from his credit report by certain dates between November 2007 and July\n2008. He denied owing some of these debts in his response to the SOR. In his interview\nwith the investigator, he denied any knowledge about the numerous debts listed in the\nSOR.8\nThe court entered two judgments against Applicant in 2003 and one in 2007.\nUnder state law these judgments are valid and collectible for ten years from the date of\njudgment and renewable for another ten years. Ten of the debts listed in the SOR\nbecame delinquent between 2001 and 2003, some six to eight years ago. Only  four are\nnot barred from collection under the State Statute of Limitations. All remain unpaid.9\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n4\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n5\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts and three\njudgments.  He has been unwilling to pay these obligations. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ This mitigating\ncondition does not apply as Applicant has not provided any explanation for how most of\nhis debts arose between 2001 and 2003.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant was\nunemployed for four months in 2000, and in 2006, he decreased his work hours to care\nfor his ill companion, This resulted in a loss of income for him. For this mitigating\ncondition to apply, he must show he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has\nnot explained why he could not pay part of these debts when he was receiving his\nmilitary retirement pay each month and when he was unemployed, he would have\nreceived unemployment benefits. He has not shown he acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances. I find this mitigating condition does not apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling, he has not\nmade a good faith effort to resolve his debts, and the delinquent debts remained unpaid.\nHis financial statement shows that his current expenses are under control and that he\nhas sufficient income to pay future contingencies. I conclude these mitigating conditions\ndo not apply.\nMitigation may be established under AG \u00b6 20(e),  if \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue;\u201d and, under AG \u00b6 20(f) \u201cthe affluence\nresulted from a legal source of income.\u201d Applicant has not challenged the validity of any\n\n6\nof the debts listed in the SOR, thus mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. AG\n\u00b6 20(f) is not raised in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant lost income when he was\nunemployed for four months in 2000 and when he worked part-time while caring for his\ncompanion who had been injured in a car accident. He, however, has not explained why\nhe did not attempt to pay his bills during this period of time as he still received his\nmilitary retirement pay each month and some other monthly income. He did not identify\nhis expenses during these periods of reduced income. He simply did not pay his bills for\na period of time. Many of these bills are not collectible under the law because of the age\nof the bills. However, the three judgments are valid for at least  another four to eight\nyears and are collectible. He has made no effort to pay the judgments and believes he\nno longer owes the debts which have dropped off his credit report.\nApplicant has made no effort to resolve the many debts listed in the SOR and\nhas not provided any explanation for his conduct. He chose to ignore his debts, not\nresolve them. He has not established that he mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \n\nThe SOR does not contain an allegation 1.s. See Item 1.\n10\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

His eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed a questionnaire for sensitive positions (SF-86) on July 26, \n2007. On January 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s undated and notarized answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on \nMarch 16, 2009. Applicant requested a hearing. However, at the time he requested his \nMay 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nhearing, Applicant was assigned to work overseas and did not expect to return to the \nUnited States until November 2009. The administrative judge assigned to the case \ncontacted Applicant and explained that he could not hold Applicant\u2019s case open until \nNovember 2009. He offered Applicant three options: he could timely return to the United \nStates for his hearing; he could request that his hearing be conducted by video \nteleconference; or he could waive his right to a hearing and request a decision on the \nwritten record. After considering these options, Applicant requested a decision on the \nrecord in lieu of a hearing.1  \n \nThe Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 8, 2009. \nThe FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 9. By letter dated \nJanuary 10, 2010, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, with instructions \nto submit any additional information and objections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant \nreceived the file on February 8, 2010. His response was due on March 10, 2010. He did \nnot file any information or objections within the required time period. On May 6, 2010, \nthe case was assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 14 allegations of financial delinquency under AG \u00b6 18, \nFinancial Considerations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.n.) In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant denied 13 of the Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.j. and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l. through 1.m.). He admitted the allegation at SOR \u00b6 1.k.  \nApplicant\u2019s admission is entered as a finding of fact.  (Item 1; Item 4.) \n \n \nThe following facts are established by the record provided by the Government in \nthis case. The items include Applicant\u2019s 2007 SF-86, his personal subject interview of \nAugust 30, 2007, his responses to DOHA interrogatories,2 and his 2007 and 2008 credit \nreports.  (See Items 5 through 9.) \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and employed overseas by a government contractor. \nHe has been separated from his wife since 2004, and he communicates with her \nthrough his lawyer. They are in the process of divorcing. (Item 5 at 6.) \n \n \nDuring their marriage, Applicant\u2019s wife was responsible for the family finances. In \n2004, Applicant\u2019s wife was unable or unwilling to pay the couple\u2019s bills. She did not tell \nApplicant why she failed to pay their financial obligations. When they separated, \nApplicant believed he was responsible for his debts and his wife was responsible for her \ndebts. (Item 6 at 3.) \n \n1 I obtained the communications between Applicant and the judge originally assigned to adjudicate his \ncase. On my own motion, I have admitted those communications to the FORM as Item 4 A. \n \n2Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) on August 30, 2007. On September 29, 2008, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant \nsigned a notarized statement affirming that he had read the summary of the interview and found it to be \ntrue and correct. He made no changes, corrections, or revisions to the investigator\u2019s summary. (Item 6.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was employed in aircraft maintenance by a company from July 1994 to \nOctober 2003. On his SF-86, he reported that he lost his job with the company and \n\u201cthere was a span of time where the bills fell behind.\u201d His SF-86 notes that he began a \nnew job, also in aircraft maintenance, in November 2003. He has been steadily \nemployed since January 2005. (Item 5 at 3-5, 9.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes approximately $20,543 in delinquent debt \nto 14 creditors. Seven of the delinquent debts date to 2003; three date to 2004; three \ndate to 2005; and one dates to 2006. (Item 1.) \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied 13 of the alleged debts. He admitted \none debt, a $245 account placed for collection in June 2005. In his Answer, he stated \nthat he was making payments to the creditor and expected to make a final payment on \nthe debt in January 2009. He failed to provide documentation to corroborate his claim of \npayment. (Item 4.) \n \n \nWhen he was interviewed by an OPM investigator in August 2007, Applicant \ndenied knowledge of 14 debts in collection status, one debt that was late 120 days, and \na mortgage foreclosure of $45,500. He stated that he was current on all of his monthly \nfinancial obligations. (Item 6 at 3-4.) \n \n \nApplicant also told the investigator that he had retained an attorney to advise him \non his financial responsibilities. He told the investigator that he and the attorney planned \nto obtain and review his credit report. He stated that he would then contact creditors for \nthose accounts that showed he owed delinquencies. If he determined that the debts \nwere his, he would pay them. He stated that he wanted to have a good credit rating in \nthe future. (Item 6 at 4.) \n \n \nOne year later, in August 2008, Applicant responded to interrogatories from \nDOHA about his delinquent debts and actions he had taken to resolve them. Applicant \nagain denied 14 debts that DOHA identified as his. He further stated: \u201cThese debt[s] \nhave been a shock to me. I have forward[ed] [these] items to my attorney. She is aware \nof this and is trying to resolve the matter.\u201d (Item 7.) \n \n \nThe thirteen debts that Applicant denied in his Answer to the SOR are listed on \nhis 2007 and 2008 credit reports. The Government\u2019s evidence, which includes the credit \nreports, Applicant\u2019s interview with an authorized OPM investigator, and his responses to \nDOHA interrogatories, establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case. Applicant failed \nto provide documentation to corroborate his claims that the debts were not his or to \nexplain why he had not paid them. (Item 8; Item 9.) \n     \n \nThe record does not reflect that Applicant has received financial counseling. \nApplicant provided no information about his income and current expenses. \n \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nBurden of Proof \n \nThe Government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. To meet its burden, the Government must establish by substantial evidence a \nprima facie case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for an applicant \nto have access to classified information. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to \nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's case. Because no one has a right to a \nsecurity clearance, the applicant carries a heavy burden of persuasion. The \"clearly \nconsistent with the national interest\" standard compels resolution of any reasonable \ndoubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information in favor of \nprotecting national security.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Beginning in about 2003 and 2004, Applicant accumulated \nsubstantial delinquent debt and did not pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions could apply to Applicant\u2019s case. If the financially \ndelinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might apply. If \n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply.  If \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(d) might apply.  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nApplicant and his wife separated in 2004. While Applicant claims that 13 of the \n14 delinquent debts alleged on the SOR and listed on his 2007 and 2008 credit reports \nare not his, he has failed to provide documentation to support his claim. The debts, \nwhich date from 2003 to 2006, have not been paid. Additionally, Applicant claimed he \nwas paying the delinquent debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k., but he failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate payment. \n \nThe record does not establish that Applicant has participated in financial \ncounseling, nor does it establish that Applicant\u2019s financial situation has stabilized or is \nunder control. Applicant accused his estranged wife of failing to pay their marital debts. \nHe did not acknowledge that he too might be responsible for paying the debts. \n \nApplicant has been steadily employed since 2005. The record does not support a \nconclusion that his failure to satisfy his creditors is the result of circumstances beyond \nhis control. After a careful review of the record and the few facts provided, I conclude \nthat none of the financial considerations mitigating conditions apply to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult. \nUnfortunately, he failed to provide documentation to corroborate his assertions that 13 \nof the 14 debts alleged on the SOR were not his. His 2007 and 2008 credit reports \nestablished that the debts belonged to him. Moreover, he failed to provide \ndocumentation to establish payment of the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k.  He has not \nestablished a reliable track record of timely and consistent payment of his debts over \ntime. Because he has not received financial counseling and appears to lack a clear plan \nfor resolving his delinquent debts, it is likely that his financially delinquent behavior will \nrecur. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \ndelinquencies.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.n.:            Against Applicant \n \n \n \n   \n \n             Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n  History of Case \n \nOn December 14, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF-86). On September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B and Guideline C. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 26, 2008, and waived her \nright to a hearing before an administrative judge. On January 28, 2009, Department \nCounsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, and mailed \nApplicant a complete copy the following day. Applicant received the FORM on February \n6, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional \ninformation. Applicant timely submitted additional information to which Department \nCounsel had no objections. On May 7, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to another \nadministrative judge and re-assigned it to me on May 15, 2009. I marked Applicant\u2019s \ndocuments as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D and admitted them into the record. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nWithin the FORM, Department Counsel submitted a formal request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts relating to Russia. Attached to the FORM are \ndocuments marked as Items I through X.  Applicant did not object to my consideration of \nthose exhibits, as relating to Russia. Hence, the facts administratively noticed are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out under the heading \u201cThe Russian \nFederation.\u201d  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained \nunder Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. She was born and raised in Russia. In 1989, she \nearned a degree from a Russian university in transportation engineering. In 1993, she \nimmigrated to the United States. In December of that year, she married her husband, a \nU.S. citizen. They have two children, born in the United States. In September 1998, she \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen. She attended a technical college in the United States \nfrom September 1999 to May 2005, and earned a degree in computer programming. In \nDecember 2007, she started her current position as an engineer with a defense \ncontractor. (Item 4)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s elderly parents were born in Russia and reside there. In October \n2008, Applicant filed Immigration Petition for Relative documents for both of her \nparents, seeking to bring them permanently to the United States. Their petitions were \nrecently approved. (AE B, C and D) According to her April 27, 2009 letter, Applicant\u2019s \nparents are in the process of selling their apartment in anticipation of moving to the \nUnited States. They are awaiting a scheduled interview at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow \nand a medical examination. She thinks they will arrive here in late summer. (AE A) \nApplicant has one sibling who was born in Russia and resides in the United States. She \nbecame a naturalized citizen in March 2009. (AE D) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nIn 2001, Applicant decided to return to Russia for a visit and applied for a \nRussian visa. The Russian government denied her request because she was born in \nRussia. Because the government makes it very difficult and expensive for Russian \nnatives to travel to Russia on any passport other than a Russian one, she renewed her \nRussian passport in 2001. She subsequently renewed it in May 2006. It expires in May \n2011. Since leaving Russia in 1993, Applicant returned in December 2001, January \n2002 and October 2008 to see her parents. On each visit, she used a Russian passport \nthat makes travel there more convenient. As soon as her parents arrive in the United \nStates, she will destroy her Russian passport as she will no longer need it. She has not \nrenounced her Russian citizenship to-date.  (AE D; Item 6 at 9)   \n \n \n \nApplicant wrote that \u201cI consider myself an American citizen and have no ties to \nRussia such as financial, business or government interests. My only connection is \nthrough my elderly parents.\u201d (Item 6 at 9) There is no derogatory information concerning \nApplicant\u2019s police or financial records. She has never been fired from a job. She has no \npolice record, has never used illegal drugs, or been involved in an alcohol-related \nincident. (Item 4)  \n \nThe Russian Federation \n \n \n The Russian Federation is a diverse and vast country. It is 1.8 times the size of \nthe United States with a population of 142 million people. With the dissolution of the \nSoviet Union on August 24, 1991, the Russian Federation came into being as the \nsuccessor nation, in part, to the Russian majority portions of the former Soviet Union. \n(Item I) The country is a very large nuclear superpower that has continued to develop \neconomically, socially and politically since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Recent \nevents that have escalated tensions between Russia and the United States include the \nRussian incursion into internationally recognized sovereign Georgia territory by the \nRussian army, threats against Poland, suspicious poisonings and killings of journalists \nand other persons considered to be undesirable, and manipulation of energy resources \nto pressure NATO allies and other U.S. friendly countries, particularly former \ncomponents of the Soviet Union, to bend them to Russian policies and national \ninterests. Russia has an active, recent, and ongoing intelligence collection program \ntargeting the United States. As of 2005, Russia and China were the most aggressive \ncollectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology and accounted for the majority of \nsuch targeting. Russia has been a leader in industrial espionage against the United \nStates since at least 1997, with no indication of abatement. Russian continues the \nespionage conducted by the former Soviet Union. Russia shares various technologies \nof security concern with other countries whose interests are contrary to those of the \nUnited States. Russian officials reportedly engage in human rights abuses, including \nabductions, torture, coerced confessions, and unlawful surveillance of citizens and \nvisitors. (Item 2 V, VII and IX) \n \nThe U.S. State Department succinctly describes the relationship between the \nUnited States and the Russian Federation as follows: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nThe United States and Russia share common interests on a broad range of \nissues, including counterterrorism and the drastic reduction of our strategic arsenals. \nRussia shares our basic goal of stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means to deliver them.  The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) \nprogram, launched in 1992 to facilitate dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction \nin the former Soviet Union, was renewed in 2006 until 2013. At the 2006 G8 Summit in \nSt. Petersburg, the U.S. and Russia announced the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear \nTerrorism to keep terrorists from acquiring nuclear materials. The United States is \nworking with Russia to bring Iran\u2019s nuclear programs into compliance with International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) rules and United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n1737, 1747, and 1803. Regarding North Korea and its development of nuclear weapons \nand missile delivery systems, Russia is a participant in the Six-Party Talks aimed at the \nverifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Russia also takes part in the Middle \nEast Peace Process \u201cQuartet\u201d (along with the UN and the EU). Russia now interacts \nwith NATO members as an equal through the NATO-Russian Council but without veto \npower over NATO decisions. During the past several years, Russia has intensified its \nefforts to combat trafficking in persons. The United States and Russia are cooperating \nin the fight against HIV/AIDS. (Item I) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9:  \n[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, and then he or she may be prone \nto provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests \nof the United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport. \nApplicant exercised dual citizenship three times when she chose to use her \nRussian passport to travel to Russia after becoming a U.S. citizen. Those facts are \nsufficient to raise a disqualification under AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).   \nAfter the Government raised a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence and prove mitigation. AG \u00b6 11 provides six conditions that could \n\n \n \n \n \n6\npotentially mitigate security concerns raised under this guideline, two of which may be \napplicable: \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \nApplicant has not renounced or expressed a willingness to renounce her Russian \ncitizenship at this time, which is necessary to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 11(b).  Nor \nis she ready to surrender her Russian passport until her parents permanently move to \nthe United States.  Hence, AG \u00b6 11(e) is not applicable.  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.1  \n \nApplicant remains in communication with elderly parents, who are resident \ncitizens of Russia, a country of significant concern for information security and \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nespionage against the United States. Since 1993, she has made three visits to Russia \nto see her elderly parents and has applied for their permanent resident status here, \ndemonstrating the importance of this family relationship. Those connections are more \nlikely to generate a heightened risk of exploitation, pressure or coercion than most other \ncountries. These facts meet the Government\u2019s burden of production by raising the \naforementioned disqualifying condition. These contacts and relationships shift the \nburden to Applicant to prove mitigation. \n \n  \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nGiven the nature of the Russian government and Applicant\u2019s parent\u2019s ongoing \npresence there, a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, or coercion \nremains a concern. Hence, AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s contacts with her \nparents are more than casual given her attempt to sponsor their immigration to the \nUnited States, such that AG \u00b6 8(c) is not applicable. \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on her relationship with \nthe United States, she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. She has lived in the United States since arriving in 1993.  Her husband \nand children are U.S. resident citizens. She has attended a U. S. college. She has a \ngood position in the United States. Her sister is a naturalized U.S. citizen, residing here. \nShe is attempting to bring her parents to the United States to live. She considers herself \nan American and not a Russian. She does not have any financial or business \nconnections with Russia.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors (APF) listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nIn cases involving foreign influence, the Appeal Board requires the whole person \nanalysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of \nan applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his \nor her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given \ncase.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). In that same decision, the \nAppeal Board commended the whole person analysis in ISCR Case No. 03-02878 at 3 \n(App. Bd. June 7, 2006), which provides: \n \nApplicant has been in the U.S. for twenty years and a naturalized citizen \nfor seven. Her husband is also a naturalized citizen, and her children are \nU.S. citizens by birth. Her ties to these family members are stronger than \nher ties to family members in Taiwan. She has significant financial interest \nin the U.S. and none in Taiwan. She testified credibly that she takes her \nloyalty to the U.S. very seriously and would defend the interest of the U.S. \nHer supervisors and co-workers assess her as very loyal and trustworthy.   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. There are several countervailing, \npositive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen that weigh in favor of granting \nApplicant a security clearance. She is a mature person, who has lived in the United \nStates for 15 years, and became a U.S. naturalized citizen in September 1998 when \nshe swore allegiance to the United States.  Her husband and children are U.S. citizens. \nThere is no evidence that she has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm \nto the United States. She has worked for a defense contractor for over a year. She \nasserted her pride of American citizenship. Because her immediate family members live \nin the United States, they are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign \npower. The realistic possibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress being placed \non her elderly parents as they immigrate to the United States is low.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nFive circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  First, \nRussia\u2019s government is a rival of the United States and in some instances has not \nconformed to widely accepted norms of human rights. More importantly for security \npurposes, Russia is actively involved in espionage against the United States, and may \nattempt to use \u00e9migr\u00e9s such as Applicant for espionage. Second, Applicant had \nnumerous connections to Russia before coming to the United States in 1993. Following \nher birth, she spent her formative years there. She was educated at a Russian \nuniversity. Third, her parents are resident citizens of Russia.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 10, 2009, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nthe Government\u2019s written case on April 30, 2009. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nAugust 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the FORM on May 12, 2009. As of July 29, 2009, he had not \nresponded. The case was assigned to me on August 3, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2002, but he has worked at the same facility for different \ncontractors since 1992. Applicant had a security clearance through a previous \nemployer, but it was apparently not transferred when he moved to his current job in \n2002. He has an associate\u2019s degree, awarded in 1989. He was married from 1970 until \nhis divorce in February 2002. He married again in March 2002. He has three children, \nages 36, 34 and 26. He also has two adult stepchildren.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts, as listed on credit reports obtained on \nNovember 3, 2007 and May 15, 2008. Applicant denied all the allegations, with the \nexception of the $10,047 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, which he admitted was partially his \nresponsibility. He also provided additional information to support his request for \neligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed much of his financial issues to his separation from his ex-wife \nin 2000, and his divorce in 2002. He stated that she was awarded the house and land, \nand they split their liabilities. She did not maintain payments on a number of the debts \nthat the court ordered her to pay. She filed bankruptcy, leaving Applicant as the \ncreditors\u2019 only recourse for payment. His finances were also hampered by other events. \nHis car was destroyed in an accident in about 2001. He bought a used car to replace it. \nThe following year, the engine on that car \u201cblew out,\u201d requiring major repair work. His \nfather passed away four years ago after a lengthy illness that required Applicant to \ntravel many of his weekends to see him. His mother passed away last year. Applicant\u2019s \nwife contracted a serious disease which required five operations. She was out of work \nfrom about 2005 through at least January 2008.2  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he believed the delinquent debt of $729 alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a represents the same debt as the $469 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, under a different \ncollection agency. The credit reports list different creditors/collection agencies and \naccount numbers for the two debts, but account numbers often change when the debt is \ntransferred to a different collection company. Applicant stated the original account was \nwith a public utility company. He stated he moved out of the house in 2000, and left a \nsigned letter with the utility company stating that he would no longer be using their \nservices. He stated that he contacted the utility company and they understood and \nagreed that he did not owe the bill, but that he would have to contact the collection \n                                                          \n1 Item 5. Information in this paragraph was obtained from Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) dated October 24, 2007. \n \n2 Items 4-7. It is unclear from the limited information in the FORM if Applicant\u2019s wife was ever able \nto return to work. \n \n\n \n3 \n \ncompanies and address it with them. He submitted no documentation that he has \ndisputed this, or any other debt, with the creditor or the credit reporting agencies.3 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent credit card debts of $844 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), \n$1,041 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $2,475 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and $564 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). He admitted he had \naccounts with the companies at one time, but stated they were his ex-wife\u2019s \nresponsibility. He did not submit a copy of the divorce order, listing the division of \nliabilities. The $514 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a duplicate of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i.4  \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debt of $1,316 to a collection company, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. The November 3, 2007 credit report indicates that the original \ncreditor was an oil company. Applicant was asked about the status of this debt in DOHA \ninterrogatories. The interrogatories listed the collection company and the oil company. \nApplicant admitted having a credit card with the oil company, but stated what he owed \nthem was significantly less than the $1,287 balance listed in the interrogatories. He \nstated that he would contact the creditor. No additional evidence was submitted on this \ndebt.5   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a delinquent debt of $10,047 owed to a collection company, \non behalf of a financial institution. Applicant listed the underlying debt on his SF 86 \nsubmitted in October 2007. He listed a balance of $6,000 and stated that the debt was \nincurred in January 2000. In the comments section he wrote: \u201c[w]hen my wife and I \ndivorced this was a large credit card bill that was owed. I am in a court case at this time \ntrying to resolve this, and believe it should be taken care of soon.\u201d He told the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigator in January 2008 that he stopped paying the \naccount because he disagreed with the fees he was being charged by the credit card \ncompany. He stated that he had sought legal help to dispute the charges and was still \nattempting to resolve the issue. When he responded to DOHA interrogatories, he wrote \nthat the debt was in litigation and should be his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. In his response \nto the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt, but stated, \u201cthe remaining amount was owed \nby ex-wife.\u201d He stated that he paid his portion of the debt, but acknowledged that \nbecause his ex-wife filed bankruptcy, he was responsible for the debt. He stated that he \nwas \u201cdealing with\u201d the debt.6   \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debts of $419 and $200, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k. He did not recognize the collection company identified with the \n$200 debt, and he thought the $419 debt might be a duplicate of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nNeither debt appears on the May 15, 2008 credit report.7   \n                                                          \n3 Items 4, 8, 9. \n \n4 Items 4-9. \n \n5 Items 4, 6, 8, 9. \n \n6 Items 4-9. \n \n7 Items 4, 8, 9. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. He stated he and his wife are \ncurrent on their debts that they have accrued in the last five years. He has three sons in \nthe military, two serving overseas, and he just returned from serving overseas as a \ncontractor. He stated that he would never do anything to jeopardize his sons.8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n                                                          \n8 Items 4, 6, 7. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n\n \n6 \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not resolved a number of the debts alleged in the SOR. His \nfinancial issues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his separation and divorce, his car \nproblems, his parents\u2019 health problems and death, his wife\u2019s severe medical problems, \nand his ex-wife\u2019s failure to pay her share of the marital debts. These all qualify as \nconditions that were outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires \nthat the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant did not submit \nevidence of payments of any of the debts, credit counseling, a budget, dispute letters, or \nany realistic plan to address his delinquent debts. There is insufficient evidence in the \nrecord for a finding that he acted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling and there is no evidence that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. \nThere has not been a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) is not applicable. \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a duplicate of the SOR \u00b6 1.i debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) is \napplicable to that debt. I accept Applicant\u2019s belief that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a \nduplicate of the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) is also applicable to that debt. Applicant \ndenied owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k. Neither debt appears on the most \nrecent credit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those debts. Applicant denied owing \nseveral other debts but did not submit evidence to substantiate the basis of the dispute. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to any other debt. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \nbeen through much in the last several years, including his divorce, the death of his \nparents, and his wife\u2019s illness. He stated that his ex-wife filed for bankruptcy, leaving \nhim responsible for debts that she was court-ordered to handle. He did not submit a \nrealistic plan to address his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s children are to be commended \nfor their service to this country in the military, as should Applicant for his service \noverseas as a defense contractor. Unfortunately, there is simply not enough evidence in \nthe record for me to conclude that his finances are in order.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.i \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

A. In the last year, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics, ... amphetamines, depressants, ... hallucinogenics, ... or prescription drugs?). By doing so, he omitted his marijuana use between about June 2003 and January 2007, which is alleged in SOR 1.b, and that he tested positive through urinalysis for marijuana while on active duty in the U.S. Army in January 2007, as alleged in SOR 1.d. The Government further alleged that in June 2003, Applicant also tested positive for marijuana in a urinalysis test while on active duty in the Army (SOR 1.c); and that in April 2007, Applicant was administratively separated from the U.S. Army with a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions after his second positive drug test (SOR 1.e).

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding2 that it is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a position of trust. On\nApril 29, 2010, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts\nJanuary 13, 2011\n\n3 The adjudicative guidelines were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. These\nguidelines were published in the Federal Register and codified through 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006).\nPending official revision of the Directive, they take precedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective.\n2\nwhich, if proven, raise security concerns addressed in the adjudicative guidelines (AG)3\nfor personal conduct (Guideline E) and criminal conduct (Guideline J).\nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on August 3, 2010. Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing issued on August 6,\n2010, I convened a hearing on August 24, 2010. The Government presented six\nexhibits that were admitted without objection as Government\u2019s Exhibits (Gx.) 1 - 6.\nApplicant testified in his own behalf. DOHA received a transcript of the hearing on\nSeptember 10, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged at SOR 1.a that Applicant\ndeliberately made false statements to the Government when he answered \u201cno\u201d to SF\n85P question 21.a (Illegal Drugs. A. In the last year, have you illegally used any\ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics, ... amphetamines, depressants, ... hallucinogenics, ... or prescription drugs?).\nBy doing so, he omitted his marijuana use between about June 2003 and January 2007,\nwhich is alleged in SOR 1.b, and that he tested positive through urinalysis for marijuana\nwhile on active duty in the U.S. Army in January 2007, as alleged in SOR 1.d. \nThe Government further alleged that in June 2003, Applicant also tested positive\nfor marijuana in a urinalysis test while on active duty in the Army (SOR 1.c); and that in\nApril 2007, Applicant was administratively separated from the U.S. Army with a General\nDischarge Under Honorable Conditions after his second positive drug test (SOR 1.e). At\nSOR 1.f, the Government cross-alleged as disqualifying personal conduct, the SOR 2\nallegations of criminal conduct, below.\nUnder Guideline J, the Government alleged that in July 2004, Applicant received\nnon-judicial punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Article 15,\nfor wrongful use of marijuana (SOR 2.a); that in January 2007, Applicant again received\nnon-judicial punishment for wrongful use of marijuana (SOR 2.b); that in November\n2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with child neglect (SOR 2.c); and that his\ndeliberate falsification of his SF 85P was also criminal conduct, as it violated 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1001 (SOR 2.d).\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant denied the SOR 1.a allegation, but admitted\nthe remaining allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of\nfact. Having reviewed Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, the transcript, and exhibits, I\nmake the following additional findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 31 years old, and is employed by a defense contractor in a logistics\nsupport position that requires he have access to sensitive automated information and\n\n4 The record does not indicate why more than a year elapsed between Applicant\u2019s positive test and the Article\n15 hearing.\n3\nhigh-value inventory to perform his duties. He has held his current job since April 2007.\n(Tr. 23) After graduating from high school in June 1998, he worked as an office\nassistant at a law firm. Mindful that his father and grandfather had served in the U.S.\nArmy, Applicant enlisted in the Army in February 2001, and served until April 2007. He\nwas trained in artillery and related maintenance missions, and twice deployed to Iraq for\na total of about 28 months. (Gx. 1; Tr. 27 - 29, 34 - 35)\nBy 2003, Applicant had attained the rank of specialist (E-4). He knew at all times\nduring his Army enlistment that the Army did not tolerate illegal drug use. (Tr. 29)\nHowever, on June 9, 2003, he tested positive through a command-directed urinalysis for\nmarijuana. On July 9, 2004,4 Applicant was found guilty of Wrongful Use of Marijuana, a\nviolation of UCMJ Article 112A. He was reduced in rank to private first class (E-3), fined\none-half his month\u2019s pay for two months, placed on restriction for 45 days, and given 45\ndays of extra duty. He was also ordered to attend a two-day drug awareness class. (Gx.\n2; Gx. 5; Gx. 6) Applicant subsequently deployed to Iraq and regained his previous\nrank. (Tr. 36 - 37)\nApplicant was later promoted to Sergeant (E-5), a leadership rank in which he\nassumed duties of increased responsibility, such as ammunition chief and team leader.\n(Tr. 30) In late December 2006, he went on leave after returning from his second\ndeployment to Iraq. On January 8, 2007, when he reported in from leave, he again\ntested positive for marijuana, which he had smoked the day before. (Tr. 41 - 42) On\nJanuary 14, 2007, he was ordered to complete another two-day drug awareness class.\nOn February 13, 2007, Applicant again was found guilty at an Article 15 hearing of\nviolating UCMJ Article 112A. He was reduced in rank to Specialist and given 45 days of\nextra duty. In April 2007, he was given a General Discharge Under Honorable\nConditions. (Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Gx. 4)\nIn an October 2009 interview with a Government investigator, Applicant stated\nthat marijuana was the only illegal drug he had ever used, and that he only used it\ntwice, just before each urinalysis test. (Gx. 2) However, at this hearing, he\nacknowledged that he used marijuana at least five times. (Tr. 31)\nWhen he submitted his SF-85P on November 29, 2007, Applicant did not list his\ndrug use in January 2007 as required by Question 21.a (illegal drug use in the\npreceding year). In his October 2009 interview, he stated that he did not omit that\ninformation intentionally. Rather, he claimed he must have read through the SF-85P too\nquickly and that his omission was an unintended oversight. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2) However, at\nthis hearing, he acknowledged that he made a conscious decision to omit his drug use\nbecause he was concerned such a disclosure would might jeopardize his employment.\n(Tr. 32 - 33)\nApplicant was married from April 2002 until he and his ex-wife divorced in\nOctober 2008. (Gx. 1; Tr. 39) They had one child together, a son. Applicant also has a\n\n5 Regulation, \u00b6 C3.6.15. \n6 Regulation, \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. \n7 Regulation, \u00b6 C8.2.1. \n8 Directive. 6.3.\n4\ndaughter by a different woman before his marriage. (Tr. 34) In November 2008,\nApplicant was arrested for child neglect. He was living with his daughter\u2019s mother at the\ntime, and left his son unattended while Applicant went to the store. Neighbors called the\npolice, who took the child into custody and arrested Applicant. Applicant was sentenced\nto 18 months unsupervised probation, and both children were removed from the home.\nApplicant and his girlfriend were ordered to complete a 15-week parenting class as a\ncondition of regaining custody. Applicant now has custody of his daughter, but his son\nlives with Applicant\u2019s ex-wife. (Gx. 2; Tr. 40 - 41)\nApplicant last used marijuana on January 7, 2007. He testified that he has\npassed multiple urinalysis tests administered by his employer since April 2007. He also\ntestified that he passed urinalysis tests as part of his efforts to regain custody of his\nchildren in 2008. (Tr. 26, 42)\n \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d5 In\ndeciding whether a person should be assigned to an ADP position, it must be\ndetermined that his or her loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that it is\n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d to do so.6 The Regulation also\nrequires that DoD contractor personnel are entitled to the procedural protections in the\nDirective before any adverse determination may be made.7\nThe Directive requires that each decision be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,8\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies in the adjudicative\nguidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the\nnew guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\n\n5\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of eligibility for a position of trust.\nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a position of trust for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to\nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one is entitled to a\nposition of trust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. A person who has\naccess to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government\nbased on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in\nensuring applicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of\none who will protect sensitive information as his or her own. Any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access should be resolved in favor of the\nGovernment.\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Government presented sufficient information, in addition to Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions, to support all of the allegations under this guideline. The facts thus\nestablished raise a security concern that is stated at AG \u00b6 15 as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant has a history of adverse personal conduct characterized by multiple\nacts of criminal conduct and by an willingness to mislead the Government to protect his\nown interests. He used marijuana, which is illegal in the Army and in most other\njurisdictions, at least five times between 2003 and 2007. He also failed to disclose his\ndrug use as required by SF 85P question 21.a. The record shows that Applicant\u2019s\nomission of his marijuana use was a deliberate attempt to mislead the Government\nabout relevant information in his background because he feared it might adversely\nimpact his employment. At hearing, it was further determined that Applicant was not\ntruthful about his drug use during his October 2009 interview with a Government\ninvestigator. Although this conduct was not specifically alleged as a security concern, I\nwould be remiss if I did not consider it in my overall assessment of Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness under this guideline.\nAvailable information also showed that Applicant was disciplined by the Army in\n2004 for illegal drug use. Three years later, despite his earlier punishment, and while he\nwas in a leadership position, Applicant again used marijuana and was discharged from\nthe Army for his conduct. Also, about 19 months after he left the Army, Applicant was\n\n6\narrested after he left his young son unattended while he went to the store. In addition to\nreflecting adversely on his judgment and untruthfulness, Applicant\u2019s drug use was a\ncriminal violation of the UCMJ. His deliberate false statements through his SF 85P and\nat his interview were violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, which makes it a crime to\ndeliberately make a false statement or representation to any department or agency of\nthe United States concerning a matter within its jurisdiction. \nAll of the foregoing requires application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\n16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities), and AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative). \nAs discussed below, the allegations of criminal conduct under SOR 2 are\nsufficient to disqualify Applicant from holding a position of trust. Accordingly, I have not\napplied the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in\nseveral adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination\nunder any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a\nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation) (emphasis added). \nAdditionally, his illegal drug use is specifically addressed by AG \u00b6 24 (Guideline\nH). Therefore, I have not applied AG \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that is not\nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for\nan adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,  untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or\nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary\ninformation, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other government protected\ninformation; (2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3)\na pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; (4) evidence of significant misuse of\nGovernment or other employer's time or resources;) (emphasis added). Nonetheless,\nthe information about Applicant\u2019s drug use and arrests is sufficient to invoke the general\nsecurity concern expressed at AG \u00b6 15.\nThe Government\u2019s information was sufficient to shift the burden of persuasion to\nApplicant to mitigate the security concerns established under this guideline. Of the\ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 17 pertinent to these facts, none apply. AG \u00b6 17(a)\n(the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts) and AG \u00b6 17(b) (the refusal or failure\nto cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by\n\n7\nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or\ninstructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon\nbeing made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully) do not apply, because Applicant did not show\nthat he was in any way guided by others when he completed his SF 85P. Further, he\ncompounded his false answers to his SF 85P by lying to an investigator about how\nmany times he actually used marijuana.\nThe mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time\nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b617(d) (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur) do not apply because multiple falsifications, which are violations of federal\ncriminal law, cannot reasonably be characterized as minor. Nor can I conclude that such\nconduct is not likely to recur because he smoked marijuana as a non-commissioned\nofficer after being punished for the same conduct less than three years earlier. Also,\nafter he deliberately lied on his SF 85P, in his October 2009 interview, rather than\ncorrect his falsifications, he added to them. His November 2008 arrest, at age 29, for\nchild neglect also precludes a conclusion that he will not engage in future acts of poor\njudgment. On balance, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns about his\npersonal conduct.\nCriminal Conduct\n The Government presented sufficient information, in addition to Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions, to support all of the allegations under this guideline. The facts thus\nestablished raise a security concern that is stated at AG \u00b6 30 as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nMore specifically, Applicant\u2019s conduct requires application of the disqualifying conditions\nat AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and AG \u00b6 31(c)\n(allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).\nBy contrast, for the same reasons the Guideline E mitigating conditions do not\napply, none of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 32 apply. The mitigating conditions at\nAG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG 32(b)\n(the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are\nno longer present in the person's life) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s falsifications must be\nconsidered recent insofar as the SF 85P is part of his current request for a position of\n\n8\ntrust. Further, he also lied to a Government investigator two years after he submitted the\nSF 85P, and there is nothing unusual about circumstances that require candid\ndisclosure of an applicant\u2019s background information.\nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement) does not apply. Applicant\nrepeated his criminal conduct despite his age and experience, which should engender\nimproved judgment and willingness to comply with the law. Applicant did not present\nany information about his current circumstances that would show he is somehow\nrehabilitated. On balance, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns about\nhis criminal conduct.\nWhole-Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and J. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 31 years\nold. By virtue of his age and his experience in the U.S. Army, he is presumed to be a\nmature, responsible adult. However, since he was 23 years old, he has repeatedly\nengaged in conduct that undermines any confidence in his reliability, truthfulness, and\njudgment. Applicant did not present any information about his civilian employment\nperformance or other indicators of his character that might counter the adverse\ninferences drawn from the Government\u2019s information. Applicant had the burden of\nresolving the doubts raised about his suitability for a position of trust, but he failed to\nmeet that burden. As a result, those doubts remain. Because protection of the national\ninterest is paramount in these determinations, those doubts must be resolved in favor of\nthe Government.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to allow Applicant to have access to sensitive information. Request for\na position of trust is denied.\n                                         \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn August 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines J, Criminal Conduct, G, Alcohol Consumption, F, Financial Considerations,\nand E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG).\nMay 21, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on September 3, 2009, admitting all allegations\nexcept SOR Paragraph 4. On October 29, 2009, the case was assigned to another\nadministrative judge who scheduled the hearing for December 11, 2009. On December\n3, 2009, the hearing was continued. On December 15, 2009, the case was reassigned\nto me.  On January 13, 2010, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for\nFebruary 4, 2010. At the hearing, I received 20 government exhibits, 15 Applicant\nexhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was received on February 25, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old single man with one child, age 20. He was previously\nmarried from 1986 to 1996. The marriage ended in divorce. Applicant graduated from\ncollege in 1984 with a double major in Economics and Business Administration. (Tr. 55)\nFor the past two-and-a-half years, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor\nas a software tester. His duties include maintaining the media library used for data\nprocessing applications, and evaluating system test results for the purposes of\nidentifying defects. (AE I) According to a senior-level manager, Applicant is \u201cthe go-to\nguy when the team needs a dependable and trustworthy person to get the job done.\u201d\n(GE A) His immediate supervisor characterized him as exceptionally dedicated to the\njob, honest, and trustworthy. (AE C)\nIn September 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the\ninfluence (DUI) of alcohol. Subsequently, he was fined. (GE 1)\nTwo months later, in December 2000, Applicant was again arrested and charged\nwith DUI after the police stopped him driving down a one-way street. His blood/alcohol\ncontent at the time of the arrest was .394. (GE 2 at 9) He was fined and ordered to\nattend inpatient treatment. (GE 2) The record contains no evidence of whether he\nattended the inpatient treatment, as ordered.\nIn February 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with contempt of court for\nfailing to appear in court on a charge for inattention to driving. (GE 3 at 2) He was fined\nand sentenced to community service.\nOn the morning of February 21, 2001, the police stopped Applicant after\nobserving that his car did not have any license tags. Because of the heavy odor of\nalcohol emanating from Applicant\u2019s car, the officer administered a field sobriety test.\nApplicant failed, and was charged with DUI, driving without license tags, and driving on\na suspended license. (GE 16 at 4) Subsequently, he was fined.\nIn April 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with theft after the proprietor\nof a convenience store caught him stealing groceries and vodka. (GE 16 at 4; Tr. 44)\nApplicant was homeless at the time. (GE 16 at 5) He was sentenced to a fine and\nordered to perform community service.\n\nApplicant slashed the tires of an automobile in the parking lot.\n1\n3\nFrom February 2003 to August 2003, Applicant attended an inpatient alcohol\nrecovery program. (Answer at 1; GE 10 at 9) He was diagnosed alcohol dependent. (Tr.\n48) Applicant completed the treatment, but still had \u201cthe mindset of an alcoholic.\u201d (Tr.\n45)\nIn September 2003, Applicant was arrested after police responded to a call that\nhe was wielding a knife in an apartment parking lot and rambling incoherently. (AE 8 at\n14) When the police arrived, they charged him with disorderly conduct and criminal\ndamage.  Applicant testified that he had not been drinking before this incident. (Tr. 46)\n1\nAlso, he denied the police officers\u2019 account of what happened. Instead, he contended\nhe was walking down the street when two men threatened him. After they jumped in a\ncar, he then threw a rock at it. (GE 16 at 7) I find the police officers\u2019 account of what\nhappened is more credible.\nIn November 2005, Applicant lost control of his car and crashed it into a small\nyellow delineator. (GE 7) When the police arrived, Applicant was asleep at the wheel of\nthe car, and its driver\u2019s seat door was open. After smelling the odor of alcohol, the\nofficer woke Applicant and attempted to perform a field sobriety test. The officer stopped\nthe test after concluding Applicant was too intoxicated to safely administer it. (GE 7)\nSubsequently, Applicant was arrested and charged with \u201cextreme DUI.\u201d (GE 9 at 1) He\npleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 12 months of probation, ordered to serve 90 days\nin jail with 80 days suspended, and ordered to pay a $1,725 fine. Also, the court ordered\nApplicant to undergo alcohol treatment and attend an alcohol education class. The 80-\nday suspension of his jail sentence was contingent upon him complying with probation.\n(Id. at 3)\nApplicant complied with the court order. (GE 10 at 9) Applicant successfully\ncompleted the treatment in September 2006. (Id. at 22) Applicant continues to attend\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings consistent with his counselor\u2019s recommendations.\n(GE 10 at 22; Tr. 49) Initially he attended several times per week. Now, he attends twice\nper month. Applicant has not drunk any alcohol since the episode in November 2005\nthat triggered the DUI arrest. (Tr. 56) According to Applicant\u2019s therapist, he has a\nsupportive network of friends, recognizes the importance of AA, and lives in an\nenvironment supportive of recovery. (GE 10 at 5)\nIn the late 1990s, Applicant was a successful sales representative. (Tr. 43) He\nlost this job after his first DUI conviction. Between 2000 and 2003, he was an\n\u201cunemployed drunk.\u201d (Tr. 43) Consequently, by 2005, he had accrued 20 delinquent\ndebts, as listed in the SOR, in the approximate amount of $20,000. (Answer at 2)\nCurrently, Applicant earns approximately $36,000 per year, and has between\nfour and five hundred dollars of monthly after-expense income. (Tr. 58) On March 9,\n2009, Applicant negotiated a settlement for the delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph\n\nSection 23.f (In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)\n2\nnot listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the\nviolation was alcohol or drug related)).\n4\n3.n, a cell phone bill totalling $508. (AE N) He satisfied it two weeks later, consistent\nwith the agreement. (Id.)\nApplicant began satisfying a child support delinquency, as listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 3.d, in February 2009. At the time, he was nearly $4,000 behind. Since\nthen, he has made steady, monthly payments, and has reduced the arrearage to\napproximately $1,600. (AE M)\nThe remaining SOR delinquencies continue to be outstanding. Applicant has\nneither called nor written any of these creditors. (Tr. 57) He has not enrolled in financial\ncounseling. (Tr. 58) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in October 2007. In\nresponse to Section 23.d (Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any\noffense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?), he answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and listed his 2005 arrest.\nHe did not list the earlier alcohol-related arrests. \nIn his security clearance application, Applicant was also required to disclose any\narrests he had been charged with in the preceding seven years that were not alcohol\nrelated.  Applicant, in his Answer stated that he forgot about the 2003 arrest. Also, he\n2\nconcluded he did not need to list the others, including the alcohol-related arrests\nbecause he mistakenly thought they occurred more than seven years before he\ncompleted the security clearance application. (Tr. 53) \nApplicant indicated on his security clearance application that he was employed\ncontinuously between 2002 and 2003, which is contrary to his testimony. (GE 11 at 14)\nAlso, he listed his 2006 alcohol treatment, but failed to disclose his 2003 alcohol\ntreatment, as required, on the security clearance application. \nIn 2004, Applicant returned to school to earn a master\u2019s degree in educational\ntechnology. He graduated with honors in 2007. (GE 11 at 11) Applicant is highly active\nin the community, tutoring students, building housing for the homeless, and raising\nmoney for cancer research. (AE E)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\n\n5\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nUnder this guideline, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise\nof questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). Applicant has a history of\nexcessive alcohol consumption and DUIs. In 2005, a therapist evaluated him as alcohol\ndependent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving\nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d and 22(d), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has not consumed alcohol since November 2005. He has a network of\nfriends who support his efforts at maintaining sobriety, and received a favorable\nprognosis from his therapist. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 apply:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment,\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser), and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\n\nSee Personal Conduct section, infra.\n3\n6\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of AA or a similar organization, and has received\na favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (Id.)\nApplicant\u2019s series of criminal offenses between 2000 and 2005 trigger the application of\nAG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s criminal activity stemmed from his drinking problem.\nHe has gotten this problem under control through therapy and AA attendance. Since his\nlast DUI in 2005, he obtained his current job where he has excelled, earned a master\u2019s\ndegree, and immersed himself in community service, volunteering for multiple charities.\nAG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to,\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application in 2007,  however,\n3\nconstitutes a crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Consequently, it is too soon to conclude\nthat AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened . . .\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s mean\u2019s satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties corresponded with his descent into alcoholism in\nthe late 1990s. At the low point of his struggle with alcoholism, Applicant, while\nhomeless, was apprehended stealing groceries and liquor from a convenience store.\nAG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfinancial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling\nproblems, and other issues of security concern,\u201d applies.\n\n7\nApplicant satisfied one debt, and has been making payments toward the\nsatisfaction of another for the past nine months. However, he has neither satisfied any\nother delinquencies, nor contacted the remaining 18 creditors listed in the SOR. Also,\nalthough he acknowledged that financial counseling could be helpful, he has yet to\nenroll. AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is partially applicable, but none of the remaining mitigating\nconditions are applicable.\nPersonal Conduct\nThis security concern is set forth in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s omissions from his 2007 security clearance application raise the\nquestion of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant contends his 2003 arrest occurred after he threw a\nrock at the car of two men who had threatened him. Conversely, the arresting officer\ncontends that he arrested Applicant after he observed him wielding a knife in a parking\nlot and rambling incoherently. Regardless of whose recollection is more accurate, it is\nclear that the events leading to Applicant\u2019s arrest were neither mundane nor forgettable.\nConsequently, Applicant\u2019s contention that he did not list this arrest on his security\nclearance application because he forgot it about it is not credible.\nApplicant\u2019s lack of credibility demonstrated in explaining the omission of the 2003\narrest undermines the credibility of his explanations for omitting the other arrests from\nhis security clearance application. I conclude that Applicant falsified his security\nclearance application, as alleged in the SOR, and that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without\nmitigation.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n8\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant deserves credit for overcoming his alcohol dependence. He is a good\nemployee who is dedicated to community service. The completion of a graduate degree\nalso reflects favorably upon his character. However, Applicant has yet to make a\nconcerted effort to rehabilitate his finances. Also, he was not candid about the extent of\nhis arrest history and the extent of his alcohol-related problems on his security\nclearance application. Consequently, upon considering his case in the context of the\nwhole-person concept, I conclude Applicant is an unacceptable candidate for a security\nclearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a -2.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 3.e - 3.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 3.o - 3.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4:  Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 4.a - 4.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 3, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 19, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Shari Dam\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\nconsidered the totality of his financial problems dating from the late 1990s in reaching her decision.\nIt is Applicant\u2019s contention that his earlier financial problems were unrelated to his current financial\nproblems.  In the alternative, Applicant asks that he be granted a clearance so that he can have time\nto work out a plan to pay off his outstanding debts.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant\noutstanding debts, and was still trying to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing,\nthe Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors, and reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case\nde novo.  Nor does it have authority to grant a clearance on a conditional or probationary basis.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 08-03258 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2009).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\n3\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

On October 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 3, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On December 15, 2008, DOHA assigned the \ncase to me and issued a Notice of Hearing on December 16, 2008.  The case was \nFebruary 19, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nheard on January 13, 2009, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 7 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibit (AE) A \ninto evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open \nuntil January 28, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. \nApplicant timely submitted four exhibits that I marked AE B through E and admitted into \nthe record without objection by the Government. On January 26, 2009, DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.i, and denied the debt contained in \u00b6 1.a.  \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old and married. He and his wife have four children, ages \n30, 21, 18 and 16.  The two youngest children are still in high school.  In October 1996, \nApplicant began working for his current employer, a federal contractor. In June 1997, he \nwas interviewed by a Government investigator about financial matters that arose during \nthe security clearance process. During that interview, Applicant noted that several \ndebts, appearing on his credit bureau report (CBR), became delinquent after he was \nlaid off from a previous job. (GE 1) He subsequently received a Secret security \nclearance that is now in the renewal process. (Tr. 8) \n \n \n Applicant worked for said federal contractor until April 2000 when he was laid \noff. He was earning about $40,000 annually when he lost his position. Over the course \nof the next twenty-two months, he worked at various other jobs on and off, in between \nperiods of unemployment. He earned about $25-30,000 during that time frame.  His wife \nearns about $600 monthly.  \n \n \nApplicant returned to work with his former employer in February 2002.  He now \nearns about $80,000 annually, including his wife\u2019s salary.  In October 2007, Applicant \ncompleted an e-QIP in order to renew his security clearance. In December 2007, a \nGovernment investigator interviewed him about his financial circumstances. Applicant \nnoted that his current delinquent debts started shortly after he and his wife purchased a \nhome in July 2006. (GE 5 at 11; GE 3). They bought a $335,000 home with a $6,000 \ndown payment, requiring them to take out two mortgages. Applicant did not own a home \nprevious to this purchase. Shortly after the purchase, he was told by his realtor and loan \nofficer that he would be able to refinance the house, as he was having difficulty make \nthe payments and meeting his other obligations. During the interview, he addressed \nseveral debts (subsequently included in the SOR) and noted that he was attempting to \nresolve them. (GE 5 at 12)  He was hoping to renegotiate the mortgages, which would \ngive him additional monies to manage his other debts. (GE 5 at 12) \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant renegotiated the two loans, one to a rate of 8% and \nthe other to 11.60%, bringing the monthly mortgage payments to $2,600. Because of his \npoor credit rating, he could not find a more reasonable rate. Despite the monthly \nreduction, the payments continued to strain his budget and led to the accumulation of \n\n \n \n \n \n3\ndelinquent debts, as he still could not afford to make payments on the house and other \ndebts. (GE 5; Tr. 33-35) After receiving the SOR in October 2008, he tried to obtain a \npersonal loan, but was unable to do so because of his low credit rating. (Tr. 50; GE 5) \n \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not made mortgage payments for the \nprevious four months. (Tr. 45) He stopped making the payments in anticipation of \nobtaining another loan modification. (Tr. 56) He placed the money that he would have \nused for mortgage payments into a savings account to cover closing costs. He wants to \nresolve all of his debts and estimates that once he reduces the monthly mortgage \npayments he will have money for the repayment of delinquent debts. (Tr. 47)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has nine delinquent debts, totaling $19,484.  All \nof the debts are unpaid: \n \n1. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $164 is listed as owing to a credit card company. \nHe asserted the debt was paid. (Tr. 55-56) He was going to check into the \nmatter after the hearing. As of the close of the record, the debt remains \nunpaid. \n \n2. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $698 is owed to a department store. The original \ndebt was $400. (Tr. 36) \n \n3. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $2,798 is owed to a department store. Applicant \nbelieves the original amount was $2,000. (Tr. 37) \n \n4. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $1,417 is owed to a credit card company. The \noriginal debt was $1,000. (Tr. 39) \n \n5. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $8,622 is owed to a credit card company. The \noriginal debt was $6,000. (Tr. 40) \n \n6. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $644 is owed to a department store. The original \ndebt was about $500. (Tr. 40)  \n \n7. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $2,234 is owed to a credit card company. The \noriginal debt was around $2,000. (Tr.40) \n \n8.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h for $799 is owed to a credit card company. (Tr. 42)  \n \n9. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i for $2,108 is owed to a credit card company for a \ncomputer purchase. (Tr. 42)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted recent mortgage modification documents, listing one \nmortgage for $292,787 and the other for $75,526, for a total of $368,313.  As of \nFebruary 1, 2009, he will make two monthly payments, $1,475 and $429, totaling \n$1,904. (AE D) According to his current budget, he and his wife have a net monthly \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nincome of $5,600 (this includes his overtime) and expenses of $5,535, including the \n$2,600 mortgage payment. Under the re-negotiated payment schedule, he will have an \nadditional $700 in his monthly budget. He has not sought any type of credit counseling \nand does not know if his employer provides it. (Tr. 69) He stopped using credit cards in \n2006. (Tr. 65) He does not want to file bankruptcy. The house\u2019s value has decreased to \nabout $200,000 because of the economic downturn. (Tr. 50) \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter from a co-worker, who has known Applicant for 12 \nyears. He has a very high regard for Applicant, having worked with him closely over \nthose years. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties and does not believe that \nthey have or would compromise Applicant\u2019s integrity or create security concerns. He \nnoted that Applicant drives 160 miles a day to come to work.  Both of them are \nmachinists and have sole responsibility for maintaining a multi-million dollar building \nduring their shift. (AE E) \n \n \nDuring his testimony, Applicant honestly acknowledged his mortgage problems \nand debts. He admitted that he purchased a home he could not afford, which has \nrequired him to refinance twice. He hopes the new mortgage payments will help resolve \nthe delinquent debts listed on the SOR.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \npotentially applicable in this case. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant began \naccumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt after he purchased a home in \n2006 that he could not afford. Those debts remain unresolved. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifications. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant=s financial delinquencies arose after July 2006 and continue today. \nBecause the problems are recent, on-going and not isolated, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply.  \n \nApplicant accumulated significant delinquent debts after he and his wife \npurchased a home in July 2006 that their budget could not accommodate. That was a \ncircumstance within his control. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant has not obtained any credit counseling nor produced sufficient \nevidence to indicate that his financial situation is under control, as required under AG \u00b6 \n20(c).  As of February 1, 2009, his mortgage payment will be reduced by $700, which \nmay help him resolve the delinquent debts; however, to-date he did not produce any \ndocumentary evidence to show that he made attempts to resolve or pay the nine debts \nlisted in the SOR, despite having knowledge of the Government\u2019s concerns since \nDecember 2007. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.   \n \nThere is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) and AG \u00b6 20(f).   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 56-year-old married \nman with four children, two of whom live at home. He has a history of financial \nproblems, dating back to 1997 when he completed his first security clearance \napplication. He seemingly was able to manage them for periods of time, as documented \nby a CBR. However, that is not the situation since he purchased a home in July 2006 \nand assumed mortgage payments that he cannot afford despite a good income. He was \nforced to re-negotiate the loan in January 2008 and again in February 2009. He hopes \nthe recent reduction in monthly payments will leave him with money to resolve the \nmounting delinquent debts, now at $19,500. He realizes that he made a serious \nfinancial mistake when he bought the house and relied on his realtor and loan officer\u2019s \nadvice. With his overtime work, his budget may accommodate the revised mortgage \npayments and leave a small amount for debt reduction. Applicant wants to pay his debts \nand does not want to file bankruptcy.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s co-worker of twelve years is very supportive of Applicant\u2019s request for \nthe renewal of his security clearance. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems and \ndoes not believe Applicant poses a security threat because of them. More importantly, \nhis knowledge of the financial difficulties diminishes the potential for financial \nexploitation. The co-worker asserted that Applicant is honest and confirmed Applicant\u2019s \ndedication to his job.  \n \nWhile appreciating Applicant\u2019s mortgage difficulties in view of the current \nmortgage crisis in our economy and his desire to pay his debts, it is troubling that he did \nnot follow through on his statements to the Government investigator in December 2007 \nthat he intended to address the delinquent debts of concern. Furthermore, he obviously \ncould not afford the house he purchased in 2006 because his income was insufficient to \nmake the high mortgage payments. That financial decision fatally affected his ability to \nrepay his other debts.  And now he has failed to pay his mortgage in an attempt to save \nmoney to refinance his two mortgages for a second time. He continues to try to maintain \nthe house which he cannot afford on his income (albeit a good one) while allowing more \ndelinquencies to accrue. These current financial decisions demonstrate a lack of \njudgment. Unfortunately, he is now trapped by the current substantial decrease in the \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nmarket price of his house, which if sold, would leave him with over $160,000 in debt to \nrepay. On his income, only bankruptcy would eliminate all his delinquent debts. He \nrejects that option in a noble attempt to save his house and pay his debts.  \n \nAs of January 2009, Applicant did not produce evidence that he had contacted \nany of the creditors, most of whom are department stores and credit card companies, or \nsought help from a credit counselor. During the hearing, he indicated that he would \nsupply information after the hearing documenting the payment of the $164 debt listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. He did not do so.   \n   \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance based on issues involving his judgment. Until he \nestablishes a solid budget and a realistic plan for managing his finances, it is likely that \nthese financial difficulties will continue. For all of the above reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                           \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants. The Applicant has a history of excessive alcohol abuse that has continued off and on from 1983 until at least January 2007. During this twenty-five year period, the Applicant was charged, arrested and convicted of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol on three separate occasions, two of which involved accidents. Following each arrest, the Applicant participated in and completed a court ordered alcohol rehabilitation program. He also entered a voluntary lock-down half-way house facility after his most recent arrest. There is no evidence in the record that he has ever been formally diagnosed with alcoholism, but his pattern of drinking clearly indicates that he has a serious alcohol problem. The following facts outline each arrest. The Applicant was arrested on 1986, and charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.

During this twenty-five year period, the\nApplicant was charged, arrested and convicted of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol\non three separate occasions, two of which involved accidents.  Following each arrest,\nthe Applicant participated in and completed a court ordered alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram.  He also entered a voluntary lock-down half-way house facility after his most\nrecent arrest.  There is no evidence in the record that he has ever been formally\ndiagnosed with alcoholism, but his pattern of drinking clearly indicates that he has a\nserious alcohol problem.  The following facts outline each arrest.\n \nThe Applicant was arrested on 1986, and charged with (1) Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol.  Applicant was interviewed by an investigator on January 18, 2007.\nDuring that interview the Applicant explained that prior to his arrest, he had consumed\ntwo to three beers at a college basketball game before driving home.  On his way home,\nhe had an accident with another car.  Applicant was attempting to make a left turn\nthrough his lane from the opposite lane when the accident occurred.  He believes that\nthe reason he was at fault was because his blood alcohol level was above the legal\nlimit. He pled no contest to the charge.  The court sentenced him to three weekends of\ncommunity service, placed him on probation for one year, fined him $500.00 and\nsentenced him to participate in an alcohol treatment program.  Applicant completed all\nof the court ordered sentencing requirements.  (Government Exhibit 6).  \nApplicant second arrest occurred on July 16, 1989.  Applicant had been\nconsuming alcohol with his sister at a pub before attempting to drive his vehicle to his\nsister\u2019s house.  Applicant was pulled over for speeding.  The officer smelled alcohol on\nthe Applicant\u2019s breath and he was given a sobriety test which he failed.  He was\ncharged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  He pled guilty, was sentenced to\ntwo days in jail, was fined $1,300.00 and required to participate in an alcohol counseling\nprogram.  Applicant completed all of the court ordered sentencing requirements.\n(Government Exhibit 6).  \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s third arrest took place on May 23, 1999.  He was charged with (1)\nFelony Driving Under the Influence, and (2) Felony Driving Under the Influence with\nBAC above .08%.  Applicant stated that he began drinking in the early afternoon with\nhis friend and consumed at least nine beers over the course of the day.  While driving\nhome, he hit a motorcyclist head on while trying to make a left turn.  The motorcyclist\nand his female passenger flew or rolled over the top of his car before landing on the\nstreet with minor injuries consisting of scrapes.  Applicant was arrested and\nadministered a blood alcohol test which showed him over the legal limit.  He pled no\ncontest, the court found him guilty, he was sentenced to three years probation, his\nlicense was suspended for one year, he was fined $3,000.00 and required to participate\nin a one year alcohol rehabilitation program.  Applicant completed all of the court\nordered sentencing requirements.  (Government Exhibit 6).      \nHe currently consumes alcohol one to two times a week in social gatherings\nwhere he has about three to four beers on average.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant started using marijuana in high school, in 1980, and smoked it\nabout once every two weekends.  This pattern of use continued until he began attending\ncollege, at which time he started smoking it once a month.  This used continued until he\nfinished college.  He then started smoking it about once a week.  This pattern continued\nfor about five months when he started smoking it once every few months.  In July 2006,\nhe decided to stop using marijuana altogether.  He has not used marijuana since then,\nIn total, the Applicant used marijuana at least 100 times from about January 1980 until\nabout July 2006.  He usually used it in small groups at friends homes or in outdoor\nsettings.  At times he purchased it and other times his friends provided it for his use.   \nOn one occasion in 1983, when he was at a public park consuming alcohol with\nfriends, he was approached by police officers and searched.  Applicant has a marijuana\ncigarette on his person.  He was cited and charged with possession of marijuana.  He\npled guilty and was fined $100.00.  \nThe Applicant also used cocaine at least ten times form about June 1981 until\nabout January 2000.   Applicant used it with friends at their homes.  He eventually\ndecided that he did not like the stressful feeling it gave him and so he stopped using it\nand has not used it since January 2000.\nPolicies\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided\ninto \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n4\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n25.  (a) any drug abuse.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\n\n5\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol and drug abuse that demonstrates poor judgment\nor unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\n\n6\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G) and drug abuse (Guideline H).\nThis evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of\nthe Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude\nthere is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines G and H of the SOR.  Applicant failed to submit\nany respond in mitigation to the evidence presented in the FORM.  \nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, disqualifying conditions 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d and,\n22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent\u201d apply. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nThe Applicant\u2019s twenty-five year history of alcohol abuse includes three arrests\nand convictions for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  Although his most recent\narrest occurred in 1999, over ten years ago, there is no evidence in the record that the\nApplicant has stopped drinking or reduced his drinking for any period of time that would\nestablish a pattern of abstinence or responsible use as required by the DoD Directive. \nAlthough there is no formal diagnosis in the record of alcohol dependence, the\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol abuse is clearly indicative of a serious alcohol problem.\nBased upon his long history of alcohol abuse and its related effects on the Applicant\nthere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that he is sufficiently trustworthy for\naccess to classified information at this time. Accordingly Guideline G is found against\nthe Applicant. \n    \nUnder the particular facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use is just as\nserious.  His illegal drug use began as a teenager and continued as an adult.  He\ncontends that he stopped his illegal drug use in 2006, about three years ago.  But, he\nhas presented no convincing evidence that would demonstrate that he has clearly\nstopped this long time habit.  Under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying\nConditions, 25(a) any drug abuse, apply.  None of the mitigating factors apply.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\n\n7\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, it does not come close to mitigating\nthe negative effects of his alcohol problem and drug use above, and the impact that\nthey can have on his ability to safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is\nconcluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing\nhis request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding\nagainst the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 and 2  of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on November 20, 2007. On October 1, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E that provided the basis for its decision to deny him\na security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 6, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on October 16, 2008, and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on November 17, 2008, to conduct a hearing. On November 18, 2008,\nMay 21, 2009\n\nThe case file returned to me on or about March 24, 2009, for a decision based on the written record,\n1\ndid not include the previous case assignment, Applicant\u2019s request for a decision without a hearing, or my\nmemorandum returning the case for further processing. Copies of those documents concerning Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a decision on the written record had been retained by me, pending final adjudication of Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity suitability, and I included them in the file presented to me for a decision.\n2\nApplicant indicated he no longer wanted a hearing, and on November 20, 2008, I\nreferred the case to DOHA for processing of a File of Relevant Material (FORM).1\nOn December 30, 2008, the government submitted a FORM consisting of six\nexhibits (Items 1-6). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed\nhim to respond within 30 days of receipt. No response was received by the February 14,\n2009, due date. On March 24, 2009, the case was assigned to me to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor him. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer\nto the SOR allegations (Item 2), eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add a new\nGuideline J to allege that the conduct set forth under \u00b6 1.a. of Guideline E also raised\nsecurity significant criminal conduct concerns. There is nothing in Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 that prohibits the government from amending the SOR before\na hearing or decision based on the written record provided the proposed allegation has\na reasonable basis, is not confusing, and is relevant to a determination of the\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access.\nDepartment Counsel informed Applicant in the FORM of the motion and of his\nopportunity to respond. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on January 8, 2009, with\nclear instructions that he file any objections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received\nthe FORM on January 15, 2009. No response was received by the February 14, 2009,\ndue date. Given the specific allegation concerns an outstanding warrant for Applicant\u2019s\narrest in connection with criminal charges filed against him, and Applicant was placed\non notice and had an adequate opportunity to respond, I granted the motion to amend\non April 23, 2009. Applicant was directed to answer SOR \u00b6 2.a on or before May 4,\n2009, and that a failure to respond would be taken as an admission to the new\nallegation. No response was received.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the amended SOR DOHA alleged under Guideline E, personal conduct, and\nGuideline J, criminal conduct, that a warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest remains active after\nhe failed to appear at a pretrial conference on charges filed in September 1983 of\ncarrying a pistol without a license, altering marks of identification on a firearm, and\nsimple assault/battery (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a). Applicant was also alleged under\nGuideline E to have deliberately falsified the November 2007 e-QIP by denying that he\n\nApplicant was charged with violating \u00a7 11-47-8, which states in pertinent part:\n2\n11-47-8 License or permit required for carrying pistol-Possession of machine gun.\n(a) No person shall, without a license or permit issued as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 11-47-11. 11-47-12\nand 11-47-18, carry a pistol or revolver in any vehicle or conveyance on or about his or her\nperson whether visible or concealed, except in his or her dwelling house or place of business\nor on land possessed by him or her as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 11-47-9 and 11-47-10. The provisions\nof these sections shall not apply to any person who is a holder of a valid license or permit\nissued by the licensing authority of another state, or territory of the United States, or political\nsubdivision of the state or territory, allowing him or her to carry a pistol or revolver in any\nvehicle or conveyance or on about his or her person whether visible or concealed, provided\nthe person is merely transporting the firearm through the state in a vehicle or other\nconveyance without any intent on the part of the person to detain him or herself or remain\nwithin the state of Rhode Island. No person shall manufacture, sell, purchase, or possess a\nmachine gun except as otherwise provided in this chapter. Every person violating the\nprovision of this section shall, upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment for not less than\none nor more than ten (10) years, or by a fine up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or both,\nand except for a first conviction under this section shall not be afforded the provisions of\nsuspension or deferment of sentence, nor a probation. (R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 11-47-8).\n3\nhad ever been charged with or convicted of a firearm or explosives offense (SOR \u00b6 1.b).\nApplicant admitted the outstanding arrest warrant and explained that he was in the\nprocess of moving to another state for employment and had to carry his gun with him.\nHe denied falsifying his e-QIP and added that he had believed he had to list convictions\nonly.  After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 58-year-old electronic technician, who has been employed by a\ndefense contractor since October 1983. He seeks to retain the secret-level security\nclearance that he has held since November 1997 (Item 3).\nApplicant served on active duty in the United States military from March 1974 to\nNovember 1979 where he was trained as a fire control technician. He was awarded the\nNational Defense Service Medal, and at the end of his four-year enlistment term, the\nFirst Good Conduct award. In March 1978, his enlistment was ordered extended for 24\nmonths at the request and convenience of the government, but in November 1979 he\nwas granted an honorable discharge for reason of \u201cpersonality disorders.\u201d (Item 4).\nApplicant and his spouse divorced in about August 1978 after six years of marriage\n(Item 3).\nIn July 1983, an employee of a school bus company complained to police that a\nperson he did not know entered the office and punched him in the face for no reason.\nThe assailant was stopped by the police while walking along the road, and he was found\nto be in possession of a loaded .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol. Placed in custody,\nApplicant was positively identified at the station as the assailant, and his weapon was\nconfiscated. Applicant had an application for purchase and a bill of sale showing that he\nhad procured the weapon legally the month before, but the serial number had been filed\noff the handgun. On August 1, 1983, the handgun was test-fired by the police and it was\nfound to function perfectly. Applicant was charged with three criminal offenses: carrying\na concealed weapon without a license,  a felony; altering marks of identification on a\n2\n\n11-47-24 Alteration of marks of identification on firearms.\n3\nNo person shall change, alter, remove, or obliterate the name of the maker, model,\nmanufacturer\u2019s number, or other mark of identification on any firearm. Possession of any\nfirearm upon which any of these marks shall have been changed, altered, removed, or\nobliterated shall be prima facie evidence that the possessor has changed, altered, removed,\nor obliterated it. Violation of the provisions of this section may be punished by imprisonment\nfor not more than five (5) years. (R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 11-47-24).\n11-5-3 Simple Assault or battery.\n4\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 11-5-2, every person who shall make an assault or\nbattery or both shall be imprisoned not exceeding one year or fined not exceeding one\nthousand dollars ($1,000), or both. (R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 11-5-3).\nPursuant to section 11-1-2 of the state\u2019s general laws, any criminal offense which at any given time\n5\nmay be punished by imprisonment for a term of more than one year, or by a fine of more than $1,000, is a\nfelony. Any criminal offense which may be punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year,\nor by a fine of not more than $1,000, or both, is a misdemeanor. Any criminal offense which may be\npunishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or by a fine of not more than $500, or both,\nis a petty misdemeanor. (R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 11-1-2).\n4\nfirearm,  a felony; and simple assault,  a misdemeanor.  Applicant pleaded not guilty at\n3\n4\n5\nhis arraignment in early September 1983, and was released on $9,000 bail after\nacknowledging that he would appear before the court as required for all hearings, would\nkeep the peace and be of good behavior, would not leave the state while the matter was\npending without permission of the court, and would notify his attorney/bondsman and\nthe court clerk of any change of address. A week later, a public defender entered his\nappearance on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant failed to appear at a  pretrial conference on\nJanuary 26, 1984, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. In or before September\n1984, Applicant retained private counsel, who entered his appearance formally on\nOctober 24, 1984. Applicant did not appear at a proceeding to cancel the warrant in\nNovember 1984, and the warrant was ordered to remain in effect (Item 6).\nOn November 20, 2007, Applicant completed an e-QIP for his employment. He\nresponded negatively to the police record inquiries, including questions 23a. \u201cHave you\never been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those under\nUniform Code of Military Justice),\u201d 23b. \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted\nof a firearms or explosives offense?,\u201d and 23c. \u201cAre there currently any charges pending\nagainst you for any criminal offense?.\u201d  \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator on March 24, 2008, to\ndiscuss the 1983 criminal charges and possible omission of those charges from his e-\nQIP. Applicant told the investigator that he had been visiting his mother at a nursing\nhome (name unrecalled) when a maintenance man at the facility called him a slang term\nfor a homosexual. Applicant averred that the maintenance man referred to him in the\nsame derogatory manner when he returned to visit his mother a few days later. This\ntime, Applicant became enraged and an argument between the two men escalated into\na mutual physical altercation during which punches were traded.  Applicant added that\n\n5\nwhen the police were called, only he was arrested for simple assault and battery.\nAdditional charges were filed against him because the police found a loaded .25 caliber\npistol on him, and the serial number on the pistol had been altered. Applicant indicated\nthat he pleaded not guilty and was released on his own recognizance. He\nacknowledged that he had not returned to court, and claimed to be unaware that he was\nrequired to do so. When the investigator informed him that there was an outstanding\nwarrant for his arrest on the charges, Applicant denied any knowledge of the warrant.\nInformed that a follow-up investigation might be conducted to determine the status of his\ncase, Applicant indicated he had no intent to attempt to resolve the matter. Applicant\nadmitted that in 1983, he had routinely carried the .25 caliber handgun for his own\nprotection, and that he had purposely filed off its serial number, knowing that it was\nillegal to obliterate the serial number of a firearm. He claimed to have etched his name\non the pistol and explained that he thought his certificate of completion of a one-hour\nhandgun safety course was his permit to carry the firearm. Applicant explained that he\ndid not list the charges on his e-QIP because he had not been convicted. He denied\nknowing that he was required to list criminal charges. Applicant indicated that his\nemployer and coworkers were unaware of his arrest, but he denied he could be\nblackmailed or caused to act contrary to U.S. interests because of his arrest (Item 4).\nBy way of an interrogatory, DOHA asked Applicant to furnish court documents\nreflecting the status of his outstanding warrant. Applicant did not provide the documents\nbecause he had been \u201creleased on [his] own cognizance.\u201d He explained in his response\nof July 7, 2008, that he had moved out of the state for a job. Concerning any additional\nfacts that might assist in determining whether it was clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, Applicant added that he had\nserved his country and had lost his family while serving. He was raising his grandson\nwith his daughter, who were living with him (Item 4).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n6\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant exercised poor judgment within the meaning of AG \u00b6 15 by carrying a\n.25 caliber loaded handgun without a license in July 1983, by purposing filing the serial\nnumber from the pistol knowing that it was against the law to do so, and in failing to\ncomply with the terms of his release on personal recognizance. The evidence shows\nthat he not only failed to appear in court for his pretrial conference, which led to the\nissuance of the outstanding warrant for his arrest, but that he also left the state without\nnotifying the court. Applicant\u2019s version of the events that led to his arrest cannot be\nreconciled with the police report. He indicated he was provoked into a physical\naltercation with a maintenance man at a nursing home while the police report indicates\nhe was arrested on the street following a complaint that he punched a school bus driver\nwith no apparent provocation. At the same time, Applicant does not dispute that he had\na loaded handgun in his possession or that he had filed the serial number off the\n\nAG \u00b6 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not sufficient for an\n6\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a\nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information,\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly\ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d\n7\nweapon. Since this conduct is appropriately covered under the criminal conduct\nguideline, neither AG \u00b6 16(c) nor AG \u00b6 16(d) under Guideline E squarely apply.6\nHowever, the evidence supports application of AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant responded\n\u201cNo\u201d to the police record inquiries (question 23) on his e-QIP completed on November\n20, 2007. The government alleged only a falsification of question 23.b (ever been\ncharged with or convicted of a firearms or explosives offense), although clearly\nApplicant should have also answered \u201cYes\u201d to questions 23.a (ever been charged or\nconvicted of any felony offense) and 23.c (currently any charges pending for any\ncriminal offense). Applicant denies any intentional falsification, citing a belief that he had\nto list only convictions. While a mistaken belief held in good faith could negate the willful\nintent required for a knowing falsification, he clearly knew that he had been arrested,\nand released after posting bail. He retained a private attorney after a warrant had been\nissued for his arrest, so he knew that charges were still pending against him as of\nSeptember 1984. In the absence of any evidence of a final resolution of the charges,\nand given the unambiguous nature of the questions, his denial of deliberate falsification\nis not credible.\nAs of March 2008, Applicant believed his coworkers and supervisors at work\nwere not knowledgeable about the arrest. He had not discussed his arrest with them as\nhe believed it was none of their business. Although it would not be reasonable to expect\nApplicant to inform his coworkers about his arrest, there is no indication that he has\never informed his employer about the charges, which are still pending against him. He\nstarted working for the defense contractor in October 1983, only one month after his\narraignment. Vulnerability concerns are implicated under AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct,\nor concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known,\nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d\nNone of the potentially mitigating conditions under Guideline E are pertinent. His\ndisclosures about the offense during his March 2008 interview with a government\ninvestigator were not before confrontation, so AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt,\ngood faith-efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts,\u201d does not apply. AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\n\n8\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot be applied in this case\ndespite the passage of 25 years since his arrest. Carrying a loaded handgun without a\nlicense and eradicating the serial numbers from the gun are not minor offenses. His\nfalsification of his e-QIP raises recent personal conduct issues.\nFurthermore, considerable concerns persist for his judgment because he does\nnot intend to make any attempt to resolve the matter of the outstanding arrest warrant\nand pending criminal charges. Trustworthiness concerns are not overcome by ongoing\ndenials of intentional falsification of his e-QIP or by an account of his arrest that is\nirreconcilable with the police report. AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201c the individual has acknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps\nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d does\nnot apply.  Nor has he taken the steps needed to trigger AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has\ntaken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress.\u201d His assertion that he cannot be pressured or blackmailed has not been tested.\nCriminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern about criminal conduct:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nApplicant was arrested in July 1983 on charges of simple assault and on felony\ngun charges of carrying a concealed weapon without a permit and altering the markings\non the handgun. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, but failed to show for a\npretrial conference, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. According to the available\nevidence, that warrant remains outstanding. The lack of a conviction does not preclude\nme from considering the conduct for its security implications (see AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted\u201d). As noted under Guideline E, supra, the\nrecord evidence is conflicting on the facts of the assault. A police officer reported that he\nstopped Applicant as he was walking in the vicinity of the school administration building,\nwhich would tend to substantiate the victim\u2019s version of events. Yet, in light of\nApplicant\u2019s not guilty plea, and the absence of a conviction, the information does not\nprove that Applicant committed the assault that led to his arrest. But Applicant does not\ndispute that he was caught with a loaded gun, or that he had scratched off its serial\nnumber knowing it was against the law to do so. It is simply not credible for Applicant to\nclaim that he thought a certificate of completion of a one-week handgun training class\nwas his license to carry the gun. AG \u00b6 31(c) applies to an evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\ncontinued security eligibility.\nAlthough 25 years have now passed since his arrest, I am unable to fully apply\nAG 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\n\n9\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d because of\nthe outstanding arrest warrant. Applicant claimed in March 2008 that he did not know\nabout the outstanding warrant, which was issued when he failed to show for the pretrial\nconference in January 1984. Applicant retained a private attorney in September 1984,\nand this attorney formally entered his appearance with the court in October 1984. A\nhearing was then held on November 8, 1984, to cancel the warrant. Applicant\u2019s actions\ntend to indicate he knew as of that time that he had serious criminal charges pending\nagainst him. When Applicant failed to appear in November 1984, the warrant was\nordered to remain in effect. Applicant cannot now claim ignorance where he made no\neffort to comply with the court\u2019s conditions for his release on bail. Relocation for his\npresent employment is no excuse when he started his job in October 1983, well before\nhe retained private counsel, and he was required a condition of his release to notify the\ncourt before he left the state.\nApplicant has yet to resolve the matter of the outstanding warrant and criminal\ncharges pending against him and he is unlikely to do so. He told a government\ninvestigator in March 2008 that he did not intend to hire an attorney, to contact the court\nor the police, or to make any attempt to resolve the pending charges. He blamed the\ncourt for releasing him on his own recognizance. He made no effort to comply with\nDOHA\u2019s request to provide the court documents reflecting the status of the outstanding\nwarrant, citing the fact that he had been released on his own recognizance. Applicant\u2019s\nongoing, knowing disregard of a court order precludes me from concluding that he is\nrehabilitated. AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but\nnot limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement,\u201d does not apply despite his longtime employment with the\ndefense contractor.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments\nunder Guideline J and Guideline E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in\n\n10\nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional\ncomment.\nApplicant\u2019s ongoing, knowing disregard of a court order and his lack of candor\nabout his arrest on his e-QIP reflect an unacceptable tendency to act in self interest that\nis incompatible with continued retention of a security clearance. He has shown little\nappreciation for his fiduciary obligations as a cleared employee. Based on all the\ninformation presented, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue his access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s request for\neligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn October 8, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his job with\na defense contractor. After reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent\ntwo sets of interrogatories to Applicant to clarify or augment information in his\nbackground.  After reviewing the results of the background investigation and Applicant\u2019s\n1\nresponses to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary\nApril 8, 2010\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the adjudicative guidelines, approved by the President on December\n3\n29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, these guidelines take precedence over the guidelines provided in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included 11 documents (Items 1 - 11) proffered in\n4\nsupport of the Government\u2019s case.\n2\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue\n2\nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information. On April 23, 2009, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\naddressed in the adjudicative guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial\n3\nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct).\nOn October 13, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. On January 5, 2010, Department Counsel prepared a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM)  in support of the Government\u2019s preliminary decision.\n4\nApplicant received the FORM on January 13, 2010, and was given 30 days to file a\nresponse to the FORM. Applicant did not submit a response before the deadline, and\nthe case was assigned to me on April 2, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Government alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection\nin April 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and that he owes approximately $21,642 for 14 delinquent or\npast-due debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.o). Applicant admitted these allegations. (FORM Item 6)\nThe Government also alleged that, in response to e-QIP question 27.b (In the\nlast 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any property repossessed for\nany reason?), he answered \u201cno,\u201d thereby deliberately omitting that his car was\nrepossessed in January 2007 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that, in response to\ne-QIP question 28.a (In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on\nany debt(s)?), he answered \u201cno,\u201d thereby deliberately omitting the fact that he owes the\ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.l (SOR \u00b6 2.b); and that, in response to e-QIP question\n28.b (Are you currently more than 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?), he answered\n\u201cno,\u201d thereby deliberately omitting the fact that he owes the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\n- 1.o (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Applicant admitted that he answered \u201cno\u201d to these questions, but\nstated that he made a mistake in answering as he did. These responses are entered as\ndenials. In addition to the facts entered in the record through Applicant\u2019s admissions, I\nmake the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 54 years old and is employed by a defense contractor in a job that\nrequires him to have a security clearance. He and his wife have been married since July\n1991. He did not list any children in his e-QIP. (FORM, Item 7)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n3\nApplicant has experienced financial problems since at least April 2001, when he\nand his wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. They paid $700 each month until\nJanuary 2005, when the debts contained in the petition, which totaled about $39,000,\nwere discharged. (FORM, Item 7; FORM, Item 8; FORM, Item 9) \nSince December 2004, Applicant has amassed more than $21,000 in delinquent\nor past-due personal debt. The majority of this amount consists of a $10,896 debt (SOR\n1.j) for the remainder after resale of a car that was repossessed in January 2007.\n(FORM, Item 8; FORM, Item 10; FORM, Item 11) When he was interviewed for his\nclearance by a government investigator in January 2008, he acknowledged the debts in\nhis credit history and attributed his current problems to the fact that he was, until\nrecently, the sole income earner. He also averred that when he and his wife filed\nChapter 13 bankruptcy, the required monthly payment further strained their finances. He\napparently regrets not filing for Chapter 7 liquidation of his debts. However, Applicant\nalso admitted that he has no excuse for most of his debts. (FORM, Item 8)\nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) as part of his response\nto interrogatories. Based on the combined net monthly income of Applicant and his wife,\nafter paying monthly expenses (including about $540 to five debts not listed in the\nSOR), he has about $2,311 remaining. Applicant provided with his answer to the SOR\ndocuments showing he enrolled in a credit repair program in April 2009. However, he\nhas not provided information showing that he is making regular payments to any of the\ndebts in the SOR. It is not clear if the credit repair program also provides Applicant with\nfinancial counseling or other assistance in resolving his past-due debts.\nIn his October 8, 2007, e-QIP, Applicant listed his Chapter 13 bankruptcy but did\nnot list any of the debts reported through his background investigation. When he was\ninterviewed for his security clearance, Applicant acknowledged responsibility for most of\nthe debts in the credit report the investigator showed him. (FORM, Item 7; FORM, Item\n8)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative\nguidelines.  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the\n5\nnew guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concern and adjudicative factors under AG \u00b6 15\n(Guideline E- Personal Conduct) and AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the national interest.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe information in the FORM, along with Applicant\u2019s unqualified admissions,\nsupports the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.o. Further, according to the credit reports\n\n5\nprovided, the debts alleged became delinquent as far back as October 2005. Available\ninformation requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations).\nIn response, Applicant did not provide before the deadline to respond to the\nFORM any information that would mitigate or extenuate the adverse security\nimplications of the Government\u2019s information. Applicant\u2019s submission with his answer to\nthe SOR shows only that he has subscribed to a credit repair service. It does not show\nthat he has paid or is paying his debts, despite the fact that he has a significant positive\nmonthly cash flow that would allow him to pay more than his PFS showed. Further, his\ninformation does not show that he is receiving any financial advice or debt counseling to\nimprove the way he manages his finances. Accordingly, none of the mitigating\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 20 apply, and the security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances\nremain unchanged.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Government alleged (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c) that Applicant deliberately\nfalsified his answers to three questions in his e-QIP that asked him to disclose if he had\nproperty repossessed in the last seven years or if he had any debts more than 180 or\n90 days past due. The security concern raised by these allegations, as stated at AG \u00b6\n15, is that:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAlthough he admitted answering \u201cno\u201d to those questions, he denied the gravamen of the\nallegations; namely, that he intended his answers to deceive or mislead the\ngovernment. By denying these allegations, Applicant placed on the Government the\nburden of \u201cpresenting witnesses and other information to establish facts that have been\ncontroverted.\u201d (Directive, E3.1.14) \nAside from the e-QIP (Gx. 1) that shows he answered \u201cno\u201d as alleged, there is no\ninformation that directly shows that Applicant intentionally provided false answers as\nalleged. However, the totality of available information supports a conclusion that he did\nso. The summary of his January 2008 subject interview shows that Applicant did not\nrecognize a number of the debts listed in a credit report the investigator showed him.\nBut he specifically knew about his repossession and that he owed many other debts\nthat arose after his Chapter 13 bankruptcy was discharged in 2005. It can also be\nreasonably inferred that he knew when he completed the e-QIP that he was at least 90\nor 180 days past due on most of his debts. In light of all of the information about his\ndebts, Applicant\u2019s claim that he did not disclose his debts because he checked the\nwrong box is insufficient. Based on all of the foregoing, I conclude that the disqualifying\n\n The mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\n9\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) and AG \u00b6 17(f) (association with persons involved in\ncriminal activities has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations) are inapposite here.\n See footnote 5, supra.\n10\n6\ncondition at AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities) applies. At the very least, he could have answered \u201cyes\u201d to any\none of the questions at issue, thereby putting the government on notice that his finances\nafter his Chapter 13 bankruptcy might be a concern.\nBy contrast, Applicant presented no information that shows he tried to correct his\nomissions before his interview, or that his answers were given according to erroneous\nadvice from an otherwise qualified source. Accordingly, the mitigating conditions at AG\n\u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) and AG \u00b6 17(b) (the\nrefusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal\ncounsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security\nclearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide\nthe information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully) do not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s false statements in his e-QIP were made recently and constitute a\nsignificant offense in terms of the government\u2019s ability to manage its personnel security\nprogram. Accordingly, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or\nso much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  On balance, I\n9\nconclude he has failed to mitigate the security concerns about his personal conduct.\nWhole Person\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant, a 54-year-old defense\ncontractor, is presumed to be a mature, responsible adult. He and his wife have been\nmarried for over 18 years, and he appears to have a consistent record of steady\nemployment during that time. However, without additional information about his\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, positive inferences to be drawn from his age\nand his stable employment history are not enough to overcome the security concerns\nabout his recent delinquent debt that arose despite a bankruptcy petition completed less\nthan six years ago. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information\n10\ncreates doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a clearance that his response has\n\n See footnote 8, supra. \n11\n7\nnot adequately addressed. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in\nthese determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed $35,800 in delinquent debt (SOR 1.a-1.f). In his Answer, Applicant explained that the debt in SOR 1.a was a disputed fee from his divorce attorney, whom he felt he had overpaid. He expressed his intent to resolve that debt within the next 90 days, and also to pay the $86 debt in SOR 1.b within 60 days. Applicant denied owing the debts in SOR 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, on the basis that they had been paid. Applicant attributed the delinquencies to a divorce and costly vehicle repairs. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 50-year-old senior test engineer (Ex. 1), who served in the United States military from April 1979 to April 1985. He has held a Department of Defense security clearance for over the past 25 plus years for his work in the defense contract sector (Tr. 21), including the defense contractor for which he has worked since November 1999 (Ex. 1, Tr. 109). Applicant married in June 1985. He and his spouse had two daughters, who were born in 1989 and 1991 (Exs. 1, A). Around late 2002 (Answer) or early 2003 (Tr. 22), he and his spouse separated. In late October 2004, Applicant was granted a divorce from his spouse (Ex. A). He was ordered to pay child support of between $350 and $360 per month (Tr. 68). Unhappy with his legal representation, he fired his divorce attorney after incurring about $4,000 in leg",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Kenneth A. Leary, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owes about $29,228 in delinquent debt from the 2003/04 time frame.\nWhile the debts were incurred in part because of a divorce, financial concerns persist\nbecause of his failure to timely address his past due obligations. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on November 27, 2007. On April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, that provided the basis\nfor its preliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and to refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nJanuary 15, 2010\n\n2\nOn May 19, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 26, 2009, to conduct a hearing and to determine\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. On August 11, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for September 16,\n2009. With the agreement of the parties, on August 20, 2009, I rescheduled the hearing\nfor September 15, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as rescheduled. Six government exhibits (Exs. 1-6) were\nadmitted into evidence without any objections. Applicant submitted three exhibits (Exs.\nA-C), which were entered into the record without any objections, and he testified, as\nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on September 24, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed\n$35,800 in delinquent debt (SOR 1.a-1.f). In his Answer, Applicant explained that the\ndebt in SOR 1.a was a disputed fee from his divorce attorney, whom he felt he had\noverpaid. He expressed his intent to resolve that debt within the next 90 days, and also\nto pay the $86 debt in SOR 1.b within 60 days. Applicant denied owing the debts in\nSOR 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, on the basis that they had been paid. Applicant attributed the\ndelinquencies to a divorce and costly vehicle repairs.\nAfter considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old senior test engineer (Ex. 1), who served in the United\nStates military from April 1979 to April 1985. He has held a Department of Defense\nsecurity clearance for over the past 25 plus years for his work in the defense contract\nsector (Tr. 21), including the defense contractor for which he has worked since\nNovember 1999 (Ex. 1, Tr. 109).\nApplicant married in June 1985. He and his spouse had two daughters, who were\nborn in 1989 and 1991 (Exs. 1, A). Around late 2002 (Answer) or early 2003 (Tr. 22), he\nand his spouse separated. In late October 2004, Applicant was granted a divorce from\nhis spouse (Ex. A). He was ordered to pay child support of between $350 and $360 per\nmonth (Tr. 68). Unhappy with his legal representation, he fired his divorce attorney after\nincurring about $4,000 in legal costs (Answer, Tr. 66). In April 2005, his divorce attorney\nobtained a small claims judgment against him in the amount of $775 (SOR 1.a) (Ex. 6),\nfor unpaid billed charges (Tr. 67). Applicant disputed the fee as unjustified (Tr. 33).\nWhen his divorce was pending, Applicant fell behind in some consumer credit\nobligations because he could not afford to pay them while maintaining a separate\nresidence suitable for his daughters\u2019 visits (Tr. 25). He also incurred unexpected vehicle\nrepair costs (Answer), including about $2,500 to $3,000 each for two vehicle\ntransmissions (Tr. 64, 77). Some accounts were charged off or placed for collection or\nboth as follows:\n\nApplicant indicated that the creditor in SOR 1.f was attempting to collect a delinquent balance on an\n1\naccount ending in x3737. As of December 2008 (Ex. 4), there was no outstanding balance reported for the\ncredit card account ending in x3737. This is likely the account covered in 1.f, given Applicant\u2019s claimed\nsatisfaction and the recent withdrawal of the lawsuit by the assignee. Yet, Applicant also made\nunsubstantiated claims during his February 2008 interview suggesting that the debts in SOR 1.f and 1.e\npertained to a different account ending in x6032; that a balance of $7,599 was sold to the creditor in SOR 1.e\n(balance $13,890), and then to a subsequent assignee (balance $14,807), before it was bought by the lender\nin SOR 1.f (balance $5,711.31). His December 2008 credit report (Ex.4) shows an outstanding balance of\n$16,178 owed to the assignee in SOR 1.e.\n3\n\u2022\nA revolving charge account debt of $10,037 was placed for\ncollection after no activity since March 2003 (SOR 1.c).\n\u2022\nA credit card account held since August 2002 (Exs. 4, 5), was\ncharged off in October 2004 and placed for collection in about\nNovember 2004 (SOR 1.f) with about $5,431 owed. In August\n2007, a subsequent assignee filed a lawsuit to recover an alleged\nbalance of about $5,711.31 (Exs. 2, 3, B). Applicant contested the\ndebt in court on the basis that he had paid it in late 2004 (Ex. 3). In\nApril 2009, the plaintiff withdrew its lawsuit (Ex. B).\n\u2022\nIn October 2004, a bank placed a delinquent credit card balance for\ncollection in the amount of $8,508 (SOR 1.e) after no activity since\nJanuary 2003. As of November 2007, the assignee claimed a\nbalance due of $15,584 (Ex. 5).\n\u2022\nApplicant stopped paying his telephone bill after May 2003, and in\nOctober 2003, the creditor charged off a $1,683 balance (SOR 1.d)\n(Exs. 4, 5).\n\u2022\n A cable television debt of $86 from July 2005 remained unpaid as\nof January 2006 (SOR 1.b) (Ex. 4).\nApplicant moved in 2006, and he did not notify his creditors of his new address\n(Tr. 119). In renewal of his secret clearance, Applicant executed an e-QIP on November\n27, 2007. He responded affirmatively to question 28.a concerning whether he had been\nmore than 180 days delinquent on any debts in the last seven years, and he listed one\ndisputed debt of $15,000 held by the lender in SOR 1.f that he maintained he satisfied\nin June 2003. Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 28.b inquiring about any debts\ncurrently delinquent over 90 days (Ex. 1).\nApplicant\u2019s credit report of December 11, 2007, listed delinquent balances\ntotaling $28,330 (SOR 1.a-1.e) (Ex. 5). On February 4, 2008, Applicant was interviewed\nby a government investigator about his delinquent debt. He discussed the lawsuit\npending over the debt in SOR 1.f, which he claimed he had paid. He also claimed to\nhave satisfied the telephone debt (SOR 1.d) in 2005, and the credit card debt in SOR\n1.e with a bank check in late 2004 or early 2005.  Applicant also averred that he had\n1\npaid the debt in 1.c in full by transferring the amount to a different credit card in 2003.\n\nApplicant testified that he paid the $86 by personal check on September 14, 2009 (Tr. 56). Given the\n2\nsmall amount of the debt, his testimony is considered credible as to that debt.\n4\nConcerning the $775 judgment debt to his divorce attorney, Applicant claimed to have\nmade payments to reduce the balance to $500 and he expressed his intent to resolve it\nwhen he had the funds. Applicant denied any knowledge of the $86 debt in SOR 1.b. He\nindicated he was current on all his bills and that no one could question his ability to live\nwithin his means (Ex. 3).\nApplicant worked a second job in retail about 7 to 14 hours weekly from\nSeptember 2007 (Ex. 1, Tr. 111) until August 2008 (Tr. 111) to supplement his income\nwhen his defense contractor employer eliminated overtime for his project (Tr. 110).\nIn response to DOHA inquiries about any payments on the delinquent debts on\nhis credit report, Applicant no longer claimed as of August 2008 that the debt in SOR\n1.e had been sold to the assignee in 1.f. However, he continued to assert that the debt,\nwhich had a balance of $13,890 when it was placed for collection with the assignee in\n1.e, had been paid. As for his $1,683 telephone debt, Applicant denied receiving any\ncollection notices since 2004, and he expressed his belief the debt too had been paid.\nApplicant did not deny that his divorce attorney was continuing to claim a delinquent\nbalance of $775. He would make repayment of the debt a priority \u201cif pressed\u201d by the law\nfirm. Concerning the credit card debt in SOR 1.c, Applicant claimed it was transferred\n\u201cin a debt consolidation maneuver\u201d to the original creditor of SOR 1.e and it had been\npaid in or around 2004. Again, he denied any knowledge of the $86 collection debt\n(SOR 1.b). He reported that he was continuing to contest in court the debt in SOR 1.f on\nthe basis that it had been paid. He provided documentation showing that the creditor\nhad been willing to settle on receipt of half of the $5,711 balance by July 25, 2008 (Ex.\n2).\nIn October 2008, Applicant informed DOHA that he had recently consulted with\nan attorney about resolving the financial matters listed on his credit report, and that he\nintended to be proactive in addressing the issues of financial delinquency listed on his\ncredit report (Ex. 3). On December 18, 2008, Equifax Information Services reported\ndelinquencies totaling $30,089 (SOR 1.a-1.e) in Applicant\u2019s name, including the debts in\nSOR 1.c and 1.e that he maintains are the same debt, and SOR 1.b, all of which he\nclaims to have paid  but provided no proof (Tr. 25-28, 32, 38, 56). He was current in his\n2\n$691 monthly payments on an automobile loan with a high interest rate taken out in\nAugust 2007 for $32,497 (Tr. 73-74). Applicant\u2019s 2004 Ford Explorer had serious\nmechanical problems that \u201cforced [him] to jump into [his] present car.\u201d  The lender rolled\na portion of the balance owed on the loan for that car and added it to the purchase of a\nnew 2007 model-year vehicle (Tr. 74-75).  The balance of his automobile loan was\n$28,385 as of November 2008 (Ex. 4). His car insurance costs him about $340 per\nmonth because he covers his two daughters as well as himself (Tr. 75). Applicant was\nalso current on a credit card account opened in August 2007 that had a balance of\n$1,732 (Ex. 4, Tr. 79). He bought a computer for his daughter entering college (Tr. 79).\n\n5\nOn June 19, 2009, Applicant obtained a money order of $400, which was\nforwarded on September 15, 2009, to the creditor to settle the judgment debt in SOR\n1.a (Ex. C, Tr. 33-34). Applicant continues to dispute that he owes the telephone\ncompany $1,683, which was for cell phone service he incurred during his divorce (Tr.\n34-35). Sometime in 2008, a collection agency for the telephone company wrote to him\nabout setting up a payment plan to repay the debt (Tr. 39-40). Applicant refuses to pay\nthe debt until he receives a full accounting of the charges (Tr. 35). The telephone\ncompany wants his social security number to respond to his inquiry and he is not willing\nto provide the information over the phone. He has made no effort to contact the creditor\nin writing (Tr. 117). With the assistance of his attorney, he intends to determine the\nextent of his liability with regard to the credit card debts in SOR 1.c and 1.e and to\narrange for repayment if the creditors continue to hold him responsible (Tr. 46, 84, 96).\nApplicant was no longer legally obligated to pay child support as of August 9,\n2009 (Tr. 69). He paid child support until his elder daughter moved in with him in 2008.\nWith his ex-wife\u2019s agreement, they called it \u201ca wash\u201d (Tr. 70-71) and he stopped paying\nchild support after 2007. Applicant pays his rent of $825 per month and his car loan on\ntime (Tr. 41, 73-74, 78). As of mid-September 2009, Applicant had no money in his\nsavings account. He had about $1,000 on deposit in his checking account, although he\nhad not yet paid all his bills for the month (Tr. 78). Applicant has a budget that he\nfollows but he has not had any credit counseling (Tr. 82). His annual salary from his\ndefense contractor employment is \u201croughly $70,000 a year.\u201d (Tr. 108), and he estimates\nhe has $300 to $500 remaining at the end of each month after he pays his expenses\nand gives his daughter in college between $100 and $150 per month for college\nexpenses (Tr. 71, 113). The funds go to pay down credit cards or everyday household\nexpenses (Tr. 114).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n6\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nAfter he and his ex-wife separated, Applicant stopped paying on some consumer\ncredit card accounts and on his cellular telephone account. By 2005, three delinquent\ncredit card accounts had been referred for collection in the approximate aggregate\namount of $23,976, and his cellular telephone provider had charged off an unpaid\nbalance of $1,683. Furthermore, while he had paid his divorce attorney about $4,000,\nthe attorney had to resort to a court judgment when he refused to pay the $775\nremaining fee balance. In addition, an $86 cable debt from late 2005/early 2006 was\nreferred for collection. AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d\napplies. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d is implicated to the\nextent that he  did not have the funds to make timely payments on those obligations. \n\n7\nConcerning potential factors in mitigation, the timing of the delinquencies\nsupports Applicant\u2019s contention that he fell behind because of his divorce. He incurred\nexpenses for a separate residence (although he provided no detail as to their extent)\nand for legal representation that took priority over his consumer credit obligations.\nDivorce is a circumstance that is unlikely to recur. See AG \u00b6 20(a) (stating, \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). Similarly, the breakdown in the\nmarital relationship was neither reasonably foreseeable nor completely within his\ncontrol. See AG \u00b6 20(b) (stating, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance\u201d). Yet, neither AG \u00b6 20(a) nor \u00b6\n20(b) can be fully applied. While he is paying his current obligations (e.g., living\nexpenses, car loan) on time, he has failed to act responsibly with regard to resolving the\nlarger debts in his SOR.\nAs of early February 2008, Applicant had a copy of his credit report listing his\ndelinquent accounts. He told a government investigator that he had paid his consumer\ncredit card and wireless phone debts, and that he would pay the $775 judgment\nawarded his divorce attorney when he had the funds to do so. He made no payments\nand did not contact his creditors that summer, even though he was no longer paying\nany child support. It was only after Applicant received interrogatories from DOHA that\nhe consulted with an attorney for assistance in verifying his liability and resolving any\noutstanding debts. Through his attorney, he was successful in getting the creditor in\nSOR 1.f to withdraw its lawsuit in April 2009 (Ex. B), but no progress had been made\ntoward resolving the sizeable delinquent credit card debts in SOR 1.c and 1.e as of the\nhearing on his clearance eligibility, despite a reported annual salary of around $70,000\nfrom his defense contractor employment. Applicant\u2019s testimony that he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d\nthat he had moved all his debt to one credit card account which he then paid off (Tr. 64,\n105) is not enough to meet his burden, especially where his December 2008 credit\nreport shows unpaid collection balances of $11,367 on SOR 1.c and $16,178 on SOR\n1.e. Furthermore, Applicant had not resolved his wireless phone debt in part because of\nhis unwillingness to provide the creditor with requested personal information.\nUnder the circumstances, it would be premature to apply AG\u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d Although Applicant\nhas a budget that he follows, he has received no credit counseling despite evidence\nshowing that he could benefit from sound financial advice. He testified that he has\nbetween $300 and $400 in discretionary income each month, yet he had no savings.\nWhile he had $1,000 in checking deposits, he had outstanding bills to be paid. He\nclaimed that he had paid all his debts by moving some credit lines around based on\ninterest (Tr. 57) but he was unable to recall which credit cards were involved in debt\nconsolidation efforts. The absence of any new delinquency is some evidence that he\nhas a better handle on his current obligations. However, his failure to timely investigate\nand attend to his delinquent debts, especially knowing that they were of concern to the\n\n8\nDepartment of Defense, raises considerable doubts about his financial judgment and\nabout his commitment to resolving the remaining delinquencies in the near future.\nAG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies in limited part. He paid the $86 cable debt (SOR\n1.b) and settled the judgment debt (SOR 1.a), although the timing of those payments\nmade just before the security clearance proceedings suggests that he was motivated\nby the clearance issue rather than obligation to his creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) and \u00b6 20(e),\n\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt\nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d applies to the\ndebt in SOR 1.f. Available information, including Applicant\u2019s admissions during his\nFebruary 2008 interview, shows that a credit card account ending in x3737 was referred\nfor collection in the approximate amount of $5,431, likely with the assignee in SOR 1.f.\nApplicant contended that the debt had been paid. While he did not furnish proof of\npayment, the creditor\u2019s withdrawal of the lawsuit coupled with Equifax not listing any\ncurrent delinquency for that account substantiates his position that he does not\npresently owe the alleged debt. In contrast, Applicant did not meet his burden of\ndemonstrating that SOR 1.c and 1.e pertain to the same debt, or that he does not owe\nthe balances in SOR 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. Financial concerns are not fully mitigated in light\nof his demonstrated disregard of those debts over the past five years.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s divorce explains why he fell behind in his financial obligations initially,\nand he had unexpected vehicle repair expenses and ongoing child support payments\nthat affected his ability to repay his debt. But he did not show good faith when he did not\nreport his change of address to his creditors in 2006. As of 2008, he was no longer\npaying child support and should have been in a better financial position to make\npayments on his old debts. Faced with a credit report that listed unpaid delinquent debt\nthat adversely affected his credit, such as a higher interest on a car loan making his\npayment $691 a month, Applicant largely ignored the debts until he was contacted by\nDOHA in the fall of 2008. While he retained the services of a lawyer, neither he nor his\n\n9\nattorney showed any urgency in resolving the issues of concern. As of mid-September\n2009, Applicant had not contacted the creditors in SOR 1.c or 1.e. He presented nothing\nthat would definitively disprove his liability. Nor had he saved any funds to make\npayments on those debts should the creditors continue to hold him liable for past due\nbalances. Given the ongoing concerns about Applicant\u2019s financial judgment, I am unable\nto conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",
