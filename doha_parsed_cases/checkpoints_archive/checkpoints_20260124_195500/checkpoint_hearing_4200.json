A previous \nemployer sponsored her for a security clearance. A security clearance is unnecessary \nfor her current job, but her employer is sponsoring her for a public trust position. She is \na high school graduate. She married in 2008 and divorced in 2018. She has two \nchildren. Applicant has legal custody of her older child and joint custody of her younger \nchild, but the children primarily live with her ex-husband. She has lived with her fianc\u00e9 \nfor more than six years. (Tr. at 6-9, 17-21, 35-36; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $44,000. Applicant admitted \nowing all the debts. The debts are also listed on one or more credit reports from May \n2020, July 2022, or January 2023. (GE 3-5) \nApplicant is required to pay $224 per month in child support for her younger \nchild. Credit reports show balances of $4,427 in May 2020; $11,026 in July 2022; and \n$12,331 in January 2023 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Her pay is garnished by the court for the child \nsupport. The January 2023 credit report shows a payment of $313, which means a \nportion is going to the arrearages. (Tr. at 19-22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a $3,057 delinquent debt. Applicant stated the debt was the \nfinancing for a new sofa that she bought or rented. Not too long after the sofa was \ndelivered, she discovered bedbugs in the sofa. The furniture store refused to accept the \nsofa as a return. She did not feel like she should have to pay for a sofa that had \nbedbugs. (Tr. at 25-26; GE 3-5) \nApplicant admitted that she was financially irresponsible when she was younger, \nand she \u201cmade some dumb decisions.\u201d Other than her child support, she has not paid \nany of the SOR debts. She is hoping to devise a plan to pay her debts. Her only current \nplan is to wait for them to fall off her credit report. She has not received credit \ncounseling. (Tr. at 16, 24-25, 27-36; GE 3-5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nI am giving Applicant the benefit of the doubt about the debt for the sofa. If a \nsofa is delivered with bedbugs, one should not have to pay for it. Her child support \narrearages are being paid by garnishment. See ISCR Case No. 20-03457 (App. Bd. \nJun. 15, 2023). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.j are mitigated. \nApplicant admitted that she was financially irresponsible when she was younger, \nand she \u201cmade some dumb decisions.\u201d She has not received credit counseling. Other \nthan her child support, she has not paid any of the SOR debts. She is hoping to devise \na plan to pay her debts. Her only current plan is to wait for them to fall off her credit \nreport. Intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a \ntrack record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. \n11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her \ndebts. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the above mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

The allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his June 2022 security clearance application (SCA), his August 2022 background interview, and credit bureau reports from July 2022 and May 2023. The July 2022 credit bureau report lists both SOR debts, and the May 2023 credit bureau report lists only the charged-off credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Items 1-6) Applicant attributes his delinquent debts to his divorce. He obtained an auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) to purchase his then-spouse a car during their marriage. Her poor credit prevented her from obtaining an auto loan solely in her name or co-signing the auto loan with him.

The July \n2022 credit bureau report lists both SOR debts, and the May 2023 credit bureau report \nlists only the charged-off credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to his divorce. He obtained an auto loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) to purchase his then-spouse a car during their marriage. Her poor credit \nprevented her from obtaining an auto loan solely in her name or co-signing the auto \nloan with him. When they separated approximately one year later, he allowed her to \nkeep the car with the understanding that she was going to make the monthly car \npayments. Unbeknownst to him, the car was repossessed when she failed to do so. He \nhas not made any efforts to resolve this debt as he does not have the financial means to \ndo so. He does not intend to obtain any auto loans in the future unless he needs to buy \nhis own vehicle. (Items 2-4) \nApplicant obtained a pre-paid credit card (SOR \u00b61.b) to rebuild his credit. He \ndeposited $200 onto the card, of which he used $75, and then he cancelled the service. \nHe was unaware that the card was charged off, and he did not understand why it was \ncharged off since he still had money remaining on the card. He stated in his Answer, \u201cI \nnever got any of [my] money back so therefore I don\u2019t see how I owe them anything, \ndoesn\u2019t make any sense to pay them.\u201d (Items 2-4) \nApplicant indicated during his background interview that he monitors his credit \nusing Credit Karma, and he lives within his financial means. He stated in his Answer \nthat he is the primary breadwinner, as his spouse does not work outside of the home, \nand he would not jeopardize his ability to care for his family. The May 2023 credit \nbureau report lists the following additional debt that is not alleged in the SOR: an auto \nloan account for which Applicant is $2,109 past due, with January 2023 reflected as his \ndate of last payment. I will not consider this unalleged debt in evaluating the \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline; however, I will consider this information in \nmy mitigation and whole-person analysis. There is no information in the record about \nwhether Applicant has received credit counseling.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and, AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not \npaying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely  \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his delinquent debts. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Applicant incurred the pre-paid credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b under \nsuch circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and this minimal debt does not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies to the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b and I find that allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, Applicant failed to \nmake any effort to resolve the debt in debt SOR \u00b6 1.a, and he has incurred an additional \ndelinquent debt as evidenced by the 2023 credit bureau report. There is no indication \nthat he has received credit counseling. I find that Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are not established . \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant mitigated \ndrug concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive \nnational security position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 5, 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline the DoD \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR in February 2023, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on June 5, 2023. A hearing was scheduled for August 23, \n2023, and initially heard on the date as scheduled. Because Applicant had not received \nthe Government\u2019s exhibits by the time of the hearing, the hearing was adjourned and \nrescheduled for August 30, 2023. Within the seven days allotted for resending the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits, the Government furnished Applicant the documents it intended \nto submit at the rescheduled hearing. \nAt the rescheduled hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits \n(GEs 1-4) that were admitted without objection. Applicant relied on one witness (herself) \nand 12 exhibits (AEs A-N) that were admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) \ncovering the rescheduled hearing was received on September 12, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with a transcript of her \nadministrative separation board proceeding in 2021. For good cause shown, she was \ngranted 30 days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded two days \nto respond. Within the time permitted, \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a letter \nexplaining her unsuccessful efforts to obtain official documentation of her administrative \nboard proceeding convened in 2021. Applicant\u2019s submission was admitted without \nobjections as AE O. On my own initiative, I admitted DoD instruction 1010.16, entitled \nTechnical Procedures for the Military Personnel Drug Abuse Testing Program (effective \nJune 15, 2020) for consideration, after copying the parties and receiving no objections, \nas hearing exhibit HE 1. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly received a General Under Honorable \nConditions discharge from her Air Force National Guard unit after testing positive for \nTHC during a random urinalysis screening conducted in approximately February 2021. \nThe allegations were cross-alleged under Guideline E. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, she admitted the allegations with \nexplanations. She claimed that she was aware of the requirements needed to retain the \nsecurity clearance she was granted while holding. a security clearance. She claimed, \ntoo, that the THC she tested positive for in February 2021 came from a vape pen she \nmistakenly accepted from her mother-in-law and used. \nClaiming important lessons learned from accepting vape pens from others while \nnot being more careful about checking the contents before using the device, she without \nstrangers, she aimed to be more vigilant in the future in her efforts to ensure such an \nincident never happens again. And, she claimed she never had an intention to use \nillegal drugs of any kind and has no has no intention of using them in the future. \n2 \n\nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant and \nmaterial findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant has never entered into a civil marriage or legally recognized civil union, \nbut has cohabited with another since August 2021 and considers herself married, \nalthough not legally married. She has no children. (GE 1) She earned a high school \ndiploma in May 2011 and completed military training classes between May and \nNovember 2013 without earning a degree or diploma. (GE 1) Between November 2015 \nand May 2016, she attended military university classes without earning a degree or \ndiploma. (GE 1) Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force (AF) in March 2013 and served \nthree years of active duty before receiving an honorable discharge in December 2016. \n(GE 1) She enlisted in the AF National Guard in her state of residence in December \n2016 and served four and one-half years of Active Reserve duty. (GE 1) In May 2021, \nshe received a general discharge under honorable conditions after testing positive for \nTHC during a random urinalysis screening conducted in approximately February 2021. \n(GE 1) \nSince June 2021, Applicant has worked for her current employer as a simulator \ntechnician. (GE 1) Previously, she worked for another defense contractor as a simulator \ntechnician. Between December 2016 and May 2021, she was employed as a full-time \nmilitary technician for her Air National Guard unit. Applicant held a security clearance \nthroughout her active-duty AF career. (GE 1-4 and AEs A-B and D; Tr. 13-14) \nApplicant\u2019s positive drug test \nDuring her three years of active AF duty, Applicant never used illegal drugs \n(marijuana included) and was randomly tested for illegal drugs five to six times without \nany positive test results. (Tr. 33-34) Drug testing was also a requirement for her current \njob, which she passed in 2021. (Tr. 33) \nIn February 2021, Applicant tested positive for THC in her system during a \nrandom urinalysis screening in February 2021. (GEs 1-2) How much THC was found in \nher system is unclear, as no documented test findings were supplied by either the \nGovernment or Applicant. As the direct result of her positive drug test, she received a \nGeneral Discharge Under Honorable Conditions. (GEs 1-2) Applicant does not deny her \npositive drug test; she only disputes any inferred pre-test knowing and intended \ningestion of THC. \nMore specifically, Applicant denied any intentional or knowing receipt and use of \nmarijuana or other illegal drugs containing THC in either February 2021, or at any time \npreceding or after her positive drug test. (GEs 1-2 and AE D; Tr. 33-38) She assured \n3 \n\nshe borrowed a vape pen from her mother-in-law during a visit to her home while her \nhusband was away on AF deployment. (Tr. 43-44) The mother-in-law told Applicant \nshe used the vape pen to mitigate her back pain. (Tr. AE C; Tr. 42) Detecting no scent \nand finding no reason to believe the vape pen might contain a substance other than \nnicotine, she accepted the vape pen from her mother-in-law and inhaled one time. (Tr. \n41-42) Unbeknownst to her, the vape pen contained THC. (GEs 1-2 and M; Tr. 40) \nWhile the vape pen did not taste right to her in the one time she inhaled from the pen, \nshe encountered no symptoms that would have prompted her to believe she might have \ninhaled a controlled substance. (Tr. 42-43) \nApplicant was corroborated on her account of innocence by her mother-in-law \nwho denied any knowledge of THC contents in the vape pen she furnished Applicant. \n(AE C; Tr. 35) While Applicant could not attest to her mother-in-law\u2019s overall character \n(claiming she regularly acts without consideration of others), she did not deny or \nquestion the truthfulness of her mother-in-law\u2019s own denial of any knowledge of the \ncontents of the vape pen. (Tr. 35) Since the incident, her mother-in-law moved back to \nher previous state of residence. Because of some of the character questions Applicant \nharbored about her mother-in-law, she has kept her communications with her to a \nminimum. (Tr. 35) \nWhile acknowledging her smoking from the vape pen loaned her by her mother-\nin-law and later testing positive for THC (i.e., 34 ng/mL) in her system in a conducted \nrandom drug test, she denied knowing at the time that the substance she inhaled \ncontained THC. (Tr. 38) While she didn\u2019t challenge the sufficiency of the test results, \nshe never offered any specific detailed knowledge of DoD\u2019s testing criteria when asked. \n(Tr. 38) \nWithout the full testing details of Applicant\u2019s February 2021 randomized drug-\ntesting results and administrative record of the Air National Guard separation \nproceedings, testing results detailing the percentage of THC content in her blood stream \ncannot be reliably traced and evaluated. DoD\u2019s Technical procedures for its drug testing \nprogram prescribes two check points for testing an applicant\u2019s THC level in a \nrandomized drug test. (HE 1) One records the initial screening level of THC in the \napplicant\u2019s blood stream and refers any testing of a subject\u2019s THC concentration test \nresults exceeding the 50 ng/mL cutoff level to further testing for a confirmatory test \ncutoff concentration level. See DoD Instruction 1010.16, supra. For confirmatory test \ncutoff concentrations, the test cutoff concentration is only 15 ng/mL (HE 1) \nWhether Applicant\u2019s reported 34 ng/mL THC content from her February 2021 \nurinalysis represented her initial screening result or an ensuing confirmatory test result \nis unclear. Applicant admitted only that her reported 34 ng/mL test result exceeded a 15 \nng/mL limit when asked, without clarifying whether her reported 34 ng/mL test results \nrepresented the initial screening results or the confirmatory results. (Tr. 38) Without \ndocumented test results and the transcript of the Administrative Separation Board\u2019s \nproceedings, findings on the core issue of whether Applicant knowingly and consciously \ningested THC from her borrowed vape pen cannot reliability determined. Although \nDOHA fact finders are not estopped from making favorable findings on issues of \n4 \n\n \nknowledge and intent that presumably run contrary to the findings of a separation board, \nthey are constrained to respect a separation board\u2019s findings unless challenged by facts \nthat clearly warrant different results. Without the Administrative Separation Board\u2019s \nfindings and transcript to review the Board\u2019s findings must be respected and adopted. \nWhen asked about what she faced from the convened Administrative Separation \nBoard, Applicant replied that the Board was interested in two issues: whether she \nintentionally smoked marijuana and if so, whether she should be separated. (Tr 52) \nWhile she believed that some of the Board members were not convinced she knowingly \ningested THC from a borrowed vape pen, she came away from the hearing with the \nimpression that the Board\u2019s legal office could not excuse her from any imputed knowing \ningestion of THC and mandated her separation without breaking precedent with an \nexception. (Tr. 53-56) \nConvinced her chain of command believed her and worked to retain her, her \ncommand, she acknowledged her command\u2019s ultimate reliance on its furnished legal \nadvice and issuance of a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions to Applicant \nin May 2021. (Tr. 53-54) Without the transcript of the Board\u2019s proceedings to validate \nher recited understanding of what transpired in the proceedings, her understanding of \nwhat transpired in the proceedings cannot be substituted for the Board\u2019s implicit findings \nof knowing use of a substance containing THC. \nWith no administrative record to verify and validate Applicant\u2019s impressions, the \nmost that can be inferentially drawn from Applicant\u2019s Administrative Separation Board\u2019s \nfindings is that the Board hearing her claims found enough wrongful or reckless use of \nher borrowed vape pen to warrant a general discharge under honorable conditions. \n(GEs 1-2 and AE D) Because she did not elect to appeal the Board\u2019s general discharge \nfindings to the Air Force\u2019s board of correction, the Administrative Separation Board\u2019s \nfindings and conclusions were finalized. (Tr. 57) \nWhen the concentration of THC in tested urine exceeds 50 ng/mL, most tests will \nyield a positive result according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention. See https//www.cdc.gov. In defense of her assurances that she did not \nknowingly ingest THC-laced content with the vape pen furnished her, she claimed she \nfound the pen to have \u201cno scent\u201d and produced no sense of drug intoxication. (GE 1) \nOnly after she was randomly tested for illegal drugs days later did she learn that her \nborrowed vape pen contained THC. (GEs 1-2 and AE O) To reinforce her own \nunderstanding of typical symptoms of intoxicating use of marijuana products, she cited a \nstudy from the National Library of Medicine that identified some typical symptoms \nassociated with ingested high doses of marijuana. (AE G) \nBesides denying any knowing and intended ingestion of THC from the vape pen \nshe was provided in February 2021, Applicant cited the legalization of marijuana in her \nstate of residence, while acknowledging its illegality under federal law and DoD drug \npolicy constraints. (GEs 1-2) What this illustrates is Applicant\u2019s understanding of the \ncomparative legal criteria to be applied when assessing the credibility of her claims that \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \nshe had no pre-test knowledge of the THC contents in the vape pen she was furnished \nby her mother-in-law. \nWhat the comparison of her understanding of the respective federal and state \nlaws does not answer is the question of what criteria should be used to assess her own \ncredibility. Should credibility inferences of actual knowledge or intention to use a THC-\nlaced product be drawn based on the consideration and weighing of Applicant\u2019s \nsubjective claims of a lack of knowledge and intent, or should a more objective civil \nstandard be used that takes account of all of the surrounding circumstances? \nUsing an accepted DOHA blend of personal subjective knowledge and intention \naccounts of the applicant assessed along with all of the surrounding circumstances, \nApplicant\u2019s credibility is firmly established in the accounts she has given with the aid of \ncorroborating sources. Even without an administrative record of the detailed test results \nand ensuing Administrative Separation Board proceedings to fully assess and evaluate \nthe merits of a discharge based solely on her positive test results, Applicant can be \npresumed to have offered a consistent account of her lack of knowledge and intent to \nthe administrative separation board (even if ultimately rejected by the board). \nEndorsements \nApplicant\u2019s chain of command and current supervisors and coworkers hold \nApplicant in high esteem and confidence. (AEs H-N) Uniformly, they credit her with an \nexemplary work ethic, honesty, professionalism, trustworthiness, and overall \noutstanding character. Her references expressed knowledge of her positive drug test \nwithout covering the details. (AEs H-N; Tr. 24-25) Applicant earned numerous awards \nrecognizing her AF contributions. (Tr. 19) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nDrug Involvement \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove. AG \u00b6 24. \n7 \n\n \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack f \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest a \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative and adjudicative processes. . . AG \u00b6 15. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s receipt of a General Under \nHonorable Conditions discharge from her Air National Guard unit in May 2021 after \ntesting positive for THC during a random urinalysis screening conducted in February \n2021. Her reported positive drug test raises security concerns over whether Applicant\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \nactions reflect pattern marijuana use incompatible with the judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness requirements for gaining access to classified information. \nDrug involvement concerns \nApplicant\u2019s randomized positive test for marijuana in 2021 warrants the \napplication of four disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement. \nApplicable DCs are DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d; 25(b) \u201ctesting positive for an \nillegal drug\u201d; 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia,\u201d and 25(f). \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nBefore addressing the merits of Applicant\u2019s challenges of the allegations that she \ntested positive for THC during a random urinalysis screening conducted in February \n2021, questions need addressing about which test results were used to find Applicant \nviolated the DoD\u2019s drug guidelines. The SOR references a screening urinalysis that both \nApplicant and the Government agree registered 34 ng/m. The DoD drug-testing \nguidelines assign a cutoff of 50 ng/mL for initially screen-tested individuals and only \nrefer the test results for further testing in the event the individual\u2019s urine specimen \nexceeds the 50 ng/mL cutoff threshold. \nReferred positive tests that are confirmed are subject to a lower cutoff rate of 15 \nng/mL Neither the SOR nor the evidence of record provide clarification of which testing \nlevel was used to prompt Applicant\u2019s Air National Guard to issue a general under \nhonorable conditions discharge to Applicant in 2021. Without the necessary testing \nclarity, it becomes understandable for Applicant to use the screening level cutoff to \nemphasize the low level 34 ng/mL cutoff found in her system when initially tested. \nWhether testing results for Applicant\u2019s urine specimen ever achieved a below 15 ng/ml \nlevel for positive test confirmation is unclear and cannot be resolved without Applicant\u2019s \ndocumented test results. \nApplicable federal law on the use of controlled substances \nTo prove a violation of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 829(a)), the \nGovernment must establish an applicant\u2019s \u201cknowing and intentional\u201d violation of the Act. \n(CSA) While proof standards for demonstrating knowledge and intention to use THC-\nlaced products (inclusive of marijuana) in DOHA proceedings are not totally limited to an \napplicant\u2019s subjective personal account, they do require consideration of circumstances \nsurrounding the individual\u2019s use of the product that take into account the person\u2019s \nexperience with the product (if any), visible signs or scents that the product might \ncontain a controlled substance, the reliability of the source, and other indicators that \ncould be expected to arouse the person\u2019s suspicions. See ISCR Case No. 22-01176 at \n5, n. 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 2023) While use of a reasonable, good-faith belief standard (a \nrecognized civil standard of proof) might be used as an aid in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nclaimed unknowing and unintended use of a banned THC product, it may not be used \nas a substitute for a subjective intent test that takes account of the applicant\u2019s personal \n9 \n\n \n \nclaims of innocence and the surrounding circumstances in making an overall credibility \nassessment. \nEvidentiary sufficiency of Applicant\u2019s knowledge denials \nAny inferences to be drawn of unlawful use or possession of an illegal substance \n(e.g., THC) must be the result of a knowing and intentional use or possession of a \nbanned controlled substance. This requirement holds for not only criminal and civil court \ncases, but ISCR cases as well where all that is required to meet the Government\u2019s initial \nburden is the making of a prima facie case. See Ruan v. United States, 142 Sup. Ct. \n2370, 12378 (2023) Plausible explanations for Applicant\u2019s positive drug test results for \nTHC (likely from marijuana) in February 2021 are quite limited based on the evidence in \nthe record. What is at issue is the state of Applicant\u2019s knowledge and intentions when \nshe accepted her mother-in-law\u2019s vape pen inside her pen. \nApplication of the kind of subjective intent standard in Applicant\u2019s case in making \na credibility assessment of her innocence still requires consideration of all of the \nsurrounding circumstances before assigning any inferred acceptance of her account of \nher vape pen incident. Using this set of factors to assess the credibility of Applicant\u2019s \nclaims of innocence, Applicant\u2019s claims of not knowing or intending to inhale THC-laced \nmarijuana or other federally controlled substance cannot be accepted and incorporated \nwithout an administrative record (inclusive of a transcript) to verify her claims. \nStill, Applicant\u2019s positive drug test in February 2021 was an isolated incident that \nis highly unlikely to recur in the foreseeable future, given the lessons she has learned \nfrom this experience in what has otherwise been a drug-free lifestyle (both before and \nafter her 2021 positive drug test). With an otherwise unblemished record of abstinence \nfrom illegal drug use and a rich glossary of reassurances of reliability and \ntrustworthiness from her supervisors and colleagues, safe predictions and be made of \nher avoiding illegal drugs in the future. Fully applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation is MC \u00b6 \n26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d With all of her character support \nfrom her prior command and current civilian supervisors and colleagues, the incident is \nnot considered to cast doubt on her current reliability, and trustworthiness. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nCross-alleged under Guideline E are security concerns raised over Applicant\u2019s \nreceipt of a General Under Honorable Conditions discharge in May 2021 based on her \ntesting positive for THC during a random urinalysis screening in February 2021. The \nconcerns raised are fully covered by the Guideline H assessment and are concluded to \nbe isolated and unlikely to recur. Fully applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation is MC \u00b6 17(c), \n\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d By \ntreating Applicant\u2019s positive test of THC to be isolated and unlikely to recur considering \n10 \n\n__________________________ \nall of the circumstance surrounding the incident itself and her overall history, a formal \nfinding of whether knowledge and intent to use a controlled substance need not be \nreached and formally resolved. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her positive drug test and resulting General Discharge Under \nHonorable Conditions discharge is fully compatible with minimum standards for holding \na clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions and her \nunblemished record of drug avoidance (both before and after her positive 2021 drug \ntest) and the strong character references she has received from both members of her \nAir National Guard command and current employer, she is credited with making a \nsufficient showing of good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to overcome the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns about her positive drug test and resulting General Under \nHonorable Conditions discharge from her Air National Guard unit to satisfy minimum \nrequirements of trust, reliability, and judgment for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude that drug involvement and \npersonal concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nGUIDELINE H (DRUG INVOLVEMENT): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRoger C. Wesley \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

As Department Counsel notes in the FORM, Applicant \ndrives a $60,000 luxury car, purchased in August 2022. (Item 4 at 4) While the account \nis current, it suggests that he is not addressing his delinquent debts responsibly and has \nchosen instead to incur more debts. \nThe record did not indicate that he participated in more recent credit counseling \nthrough the debt relief company, or otherwise. He also provided no details about his \ncurrent assets, employment situation, or income stream, to determine the reasonableness \nof his efforts to resolve his debts. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant incurred numerous debts in recent years, related to employment \ninstability including multiple job furloughs as well as medical surgery. The debts are \nestablished by the credit reports in the record, and by Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are ongoing and unresolved. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant stated that his delinquent debts began with his job furloughs in 2019. He \nthen retained a debt counselor but his efforts to address his debts were derailed by his \n2021 job loss and surgery. These are circumstances beyond his control, and he initially \nappears to have tried to address them responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore has some \napplication. However, his efforts have not continued, and he did not establish sufficient \nevidence that he has acted responsibly or in good faith in addressing his numerous \ndelinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant challenges his responsibility for certain debts \nbecause they have been charged off or placed for collection with a collection agency who \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe says is unable to confirm validity of the debt. He did not establish a reasonable basis \nfor his belief, nor did he provide any supporting documentation. \nApplicant\u2019s assertions that certain debts are \u201csatisfied\u201d because they have been \ncharged off are misplaced. A delinquent debt is not considered mitigated because the \ncreditor has charged off the account. The creditor\u2019s choice to charge off the debt for \naccounting purposes does not affect the debtor\u2019s obligations to the creditor. ISCR Case \nNo. 09-01175 at 2 and fn. 1. (App. Bd. May 11, 2010). While several debts may now be \ncharged off, this does not excuse Applicant from making reasonable efforts to resolve \nthem since he does not dispute that they are his. He did not provide sufficient evidence \nthat he did so. \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts have been dropped from his credit report under \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act. However, that \u201cis not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. \n14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The FCRA requires removal of most negative \nfinancial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the \ndebt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is \nlonger. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. However, this does not establish that the debts are \nresolved, nor does it mitigate the security significance of the debts. \nApplicant did not establish that AG \u00b6 20(b) should fully apply because he has not \nshown that his actions are reasonable. He did not establish that he has undertaken a \ngood-faith effort to resolve his debts, for instance by establishing a track record of steady \npayments towards his creditors, or otherwise. He did not establish that AG \u00b6 20(d) should \napply. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply, as Applicant did not show that he has participated \nin recent credit counseling or that his debts are being resolved or are under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Given the limited documentation in this case, \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his delinquent debts, even if they \noccurred due to employment instability and medical issues. Since Applicant requested a \ndecision on the written record, I did not have the opportunity to question him in a hearing \nabout the status of his SOR debts, to better assess the reasonableness of his actions in \naddressing them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. This does not mean that Applicant cannot \nestablish at a later date that he is taking reasonable steps to resolve his debts, but at this \ntime, he has not shown that he has done enough to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations due to his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 30 years old, has never married, and has no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2019. He has worked for a DoD contractor as an engineer since July 2019. He submitted a security clearance application in July 2019 (2019 e-QIP) and was granted national security eligibility in January 2020 at the Secret level. He submitted the 2022 e-QIP to apply for eligibility for a Top Secret clearance in connection with his increased employment responsibilities. (Tr. at 10-12; GE 2 at 5, 12-13, 23-24 37-38.) Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he has a history of drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant used Ecstasy in about August 2017 and marijuana from about March 2018 through at least January 2022 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). The SOR also alleged that Applicant used marijuana after having been granted eligibility for access to classified information in January 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations \u201cwith clarifications.\u201d I make the following findings of fact with respect to the SOR allegations: SOR \u00b6 1.a. Ecstasy Use. Applicant used Ecstasy on one occasion in August 2017 at a music festival he attended with some college friends. He was given the drug by a friend. Applicant views this as a one-time experience. He had never taken Ecstasy before 2 this music festival and has never taken it sin",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his most recent Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on January 31, 2022 (2022 e-QIP). On December 28, 2022, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse).

Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 22, 2023. The case \nwas initially assigned to another administrative judge and then was reassigned to me on \nApril 6, 2023. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 20, 2023, scheduling the case \nto be heard via TEAMS video teleconference on June 6, 2023. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered two documents \nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which I admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and offered 16 exhibits, marked as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through P. Applicant\u2019s exhibits were also admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel subsequently requested that the record be reopened so that he could submit one \nadditional exhibit. Department Counsel raised no objection, and I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest. On June 20, 2023, Applicant\u2019s counsel timely submitted an exhibit marked as \nAE Q, which I admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on June 13, 2023. (Tr. at 9-10.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 30 years old, has never married, and has no children. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 2019. He has worked for a DoD contractor as an engineer since \nJuly 2019. He submitted a security clearance application in July 2019 (2019 e-QIP) and \nwas granted national security eligibility in January 2020 at the Secret level. He submitted \nthe 2022 e-QIP to apply for eligibility for a Top Secret clearance in connection with his \nincreased employment responsibilities. (Tr. at 10-12; GE 2 at 5, 12-13, 23-24 37-38.) \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a \nclearance because he has a history of drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged \nthat Applicant used Ecstasy in about August 2017 and marijuana from about March 2018 \nthrough at least January 2022 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). The SOR also alleged that Applicant \nused marijuana after having been granted eligibility for access to classified information in \nJanuary 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations \u201cwith \nclarifications.\u201d \nI make the following findings of fact with respect to the SOR allegations: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Ecstasy Use. Applicant used Ecstasy on one occasion in August 2017 \nat a music festival he attended with some college friends. He was given the drug by a \nfriend. Applicant views this as a one-time experience.

Applicant disclosed this illegal drug use \nin his 2019 e-QIP. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 21-24; GE 1 at 37-38.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. Marijuana Use. Applicant wrote in the Answer that he smoked \nmarijuana a few times with friends in 2018 while he was attending college. He smoked \nmarijuana using a THC wax pen. He estimated that this occurred four or five times. The \nfriends were in his study group during his senior year in college. He never possessed, \nbought, or sold the drug. He stopped using marijuana prior to starting work at his \nemployer. His employer has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal drug use. Applicant \ndisclosed his 2018 use of marijuana in his 2019 e-QIP. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 24-33, 38-42; \nGE 1 at 38.) \nApplicant also admitted in his Answer that he used marijuana twice in 2021. He \nreported his use of marijuana in his 2022 e-QIP, and the two instances of illegal drug use \nare the subject of these SOR allegations. The first time he used marijuana in August 2021 \nwas at a friend\u2019s wedding. Applicant joined with friends he knew from high school and \ntook \u201ca few puffs\u201d on a THC wax pen. The wedding was the first occasion that he had \nseen these friends since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. The second time in \n2021 was at a New Year\u2019s Eve (2021-2022) party with friends from college. (Answer at 1; \nTr. at 24-33; GE 2 at 34-36.) \nApplicant wrote in his 2019 e-QIP that, \u201cI sacrificed a lot to make sure that I \ngraduated college and have no intention of jeopardizing my early career by using THC \nwax pens.\u201d At the hearing, he admitted that he used poor judgment on two occasions by \nsmoking marijuana in 2021. He also described his judgment as a \u201ccareless lapse.\u201d In the \nfuture, he plans to be very diligent and \u201cvery, very conscious of my actions.\u201d He also \nattributed his lapses of judgment to the end of the COVID-19 restrictions on socializing. \nNow that the restrictions have been lifted for some time, he is comfortable that socializing \nwith friends is not such a special occasion, and he can exercise better judgment in his \nactions. He has never been a habitual user of marijuana. He estimates that he has used \nmarijuana about eight times in his life. He is unhappy with himself that he used such poor \njudgment that he put himself in the position of being scrutinized for his recent drug. He \nintends to make sure that he never puts his career in jeopardy again. He is now more \nconscious of his actions at his workplace, when he is away from work, and when he is \naround others. He is confident that his past poor judgment will not be repeated. (Answer \nat 2; Tr. at 38-42, 44-48, 49; GE 2 at 35.) \nMitigation and Whole-Person Evidence \nIn his 2022 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed his marijuana use in 2021 because he knew \nit was important to be completely transparent and honest. He feels that his work is \nimportant, and he takes his work seriously. He does not intend to ever use an illegal drug \nagain. He feels strongly that the incidents in 2021 are in the past and will not be repeated. \nHe has had subsequent experiences where others were using drugs in his presence, and \nhe has refrained from participating. He understands now that his work is very important \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto him, and he does not want to jeopardize his career in any way. Applicant submitted a \nwritten letter expressing his intent to abstain from illegal drugs in the future. (Tr. at 33-37; \nAE I.) \nApplicant introduced three character-reference letters written by former \nsupervisors. Each reference provided strong endorsements of Applicant\u2019s character and \nwork ethic. (AE F; AE G; AE H.) \nApplicant also presented a psychological evaluation from a board-certified \npsychologist. The psychologist concluded that Applicant \u201cdoes not have any \npsychological conditions, behavioral patterns, or substance use problems that could \nimpair his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness related to properly safeguarding \nnational security information or working in a secure setting.\u201d In support of this conclusion, \nthe psychologist noted that Applicant has admitted to making poor choices in the past. \nThe psychologist wrote further that Applicant \u201celected to disclose the information [about \nhis past drug use] to the Government when it would have been easy to omit and conceal \nit. [Applicant] said, \u2018I just decided I would rather be honest and up front about it. That\u2019s \nwho I want to be.\u2019\u201d (AE Q at 5-6.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his e-QIPs, Answer, and his testimony at the hearing \nregarding his past drug use establish AG \u00b6 25(a). He also admitted using marijuana after \nbeing granted access to classified information, which establishes AG \u00b6 25(f). This \nevidence shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by his \nconduct. \nGuideline H includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility.  \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana and issued the Guidance to \u201cprovide \nclarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed the previous SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding \nthe importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and documentary evidence has established mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant\u2019s drug use was infrequent. He has used Ecstasy once and \nmarijuana about eight times in his 30 years. On two occasions, he exercised very poor \njudgment using marijuana after he had been granted national security eligibility. He \npresented significant and persuasive evidence that this behavior will not recur. After using \nmarijuana twice in 2021, he acknowledged his error and disclosed his actions in the 2022 \ne-QIP. This acknowledgment and disclosure illustrated a significant change in character \nand values and represented an important break from his past as a college student and \nthe two years following his graduation. He now appreciates the responsibilities he has as \none entrusted to safeguard classified information.

(AE I.) This statement establishes AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). I recognize that he made \na similar statement in his 2019 e-QIP and that his failure to abide by that prior statement \nraises questions about the evidentiary value of his current statement of intent. I am \nconvinced by Applicant\u2019s sincere testimony and the fact that he reported his \ntransgressions in his 2022 e-QIP that his undertaking set forth in AE I is sincere and that \nhe will fully honor his commitment to the U.S. Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the above whole-person factors and the potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in Guideline H, as well as the SecEA\u2019s Guidance, in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s poor judgment in \nusing marijuana twice after being granted a security clearance in January 2020 has had \na significant impact on his career, and he has come to realize that he is now an adult \nworking in the adult world, not a college kid with few responsibilities other than completing \nhis course work and graduating. His age, and more importantly, his stage in life were \nsignificant factors in his past mistakes. He has presented sufficient evidence to convince \nme that his past immaturity is behind him and that he is fully functioning in his adult life \nwith significant responsibilities for U.S. national security. He now fully appreciates the \nimportance of those responsibilities. The most important evidence is that he showed \nsignificant character and a change in attitude by disclosing his drug use in 2021 after he \nhad been granted national security eligibility. Applicant mitigated his past drug use. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence does not raise any questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

He also did not submit a \nbudget and did not detail or document his total monthly income and expenditures. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to \nAG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 1, 2012). \nThe adjudicative guideline notes two conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19 and are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence reflect that he has incurred delinquent \naccounts that occurred over several years and are ongoing. Both of the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. \n905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15. \nThere are three pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:  \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has maintained consistent employment since leaving the Army in 2016 \nand little is known about the potential causes of his ongoing delinquent accounts. In his \nSOR answer, Applicant stated that he had formulated a plan to address his remaining \ndebts and the credit reports reflect that he resolved the consumer rental account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and two other delinquent credit card accounts not alleged in the SOR. \nHowever, he has not presented any details or supporting documentation to show that he \nis resolving the debt associated with the vehicle repossession or any of his remaining \ndelinquent accounts. \nIt is also noted that several of Applicant\u2019s debts that were in a collection status \neventually dropped from his most recent credit report. However, the fact that a debt no \nlonger appears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent \nevidence as to the disposition of the debt. ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug.15, 2015). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant learned of this debt \nduring his security clearance background interview. Shortly afterwards, he took action to \nresolve the debt. \nHowever, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), and 20(d) are not applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.j. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s current financial position has sufficiently improved to resolve one \nSOR debt, his history of financial difficulties has not been adequately addressed, and \nseveral delinquent debts remain ongoing and unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is also not applicable. Applicant has not described any circumstances \nbeyond his control that led to the financial problems. Instead, Applicant claimed he was \nlargely unaware of his delinquent accounts until his background interview in July 2022 \nand that his wife managed the family finances. However, an applicant\u2019s lack of \nawareness of significant debt problems may still raise substantial questions about the \napplicant\u2019s security worthiness. See ISCR Case No. 13-00786 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, \n2014). Further, after he became aware of the debts, Applicant has not shown sufficient \nevidence to establish that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has resolved one of his delinquent accounts. However, his actions to \ndate are insufficient to establish mitigation of the ongoing financial security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nApplicant honorably served in the Army from December 2012 through May 2016 \nand has since maintained consistent employment. Once he learned of his delinquent \naccounts, he took some action to resolve one debt alleged within the SOR. However, he \nhas not established a plan or taken sufficient action to establish good-faith, responsible \nefforts to resolve his delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

The August 2021 credit bureau report lists the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.c. The November 2022 and July 2023 credit bureau reports list the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (Items 1-7) \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to minimal income, relocation costs, the \nhigh cost of living in state A, and his spouse\u2019s and father-in-law\u2019s unforeseen medical \nexpenses. He stated in his response to interrogatories that his spouse worked only part \ntime and her income fluctuated. He acknowledged that he and his spouse were also \nfinancially overextended; they utilized credit cards to meet their financial obligations; \nand they incurred some of their medical expenses when they voluntarily elected in \napproximately 2017 not to have medical coverage. He stated in his SCA: \nTook on loans and credit card debt in order to fund relocations. Shortly \nafter had healthcare expenses not covered by insurance. Our revolving \ndebt ate up all our disposable income and we had to use credit cards to \nstay afloat.  (Answer; Items 3, 7; Form Response) \nApplicant obtained the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a to purchase a car necessary for him \nto commute from state B, where he resided with his family, to state C, where he worked. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is for the cost of breaking the lease on the apartment that \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law resided in when it was no longer feasible for him to live on his \nown due to his health issues.

Applicant obtained the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c to \nassist with relocation costs, debt consolidation, and to pay for his spouse\u2019s medical \nexpenses. They could not afford the monthly minimum payment for the loan. He stated \nin his SCA that this debt was sent to a debt servicing agency (Company B). This debt is \nonly reported on the August 2021 credit bureau report. The November 2022 and July \n2023 credit bureau reports reflect that this charged-off debt has a zero balance. \n(Answer; Items 3, 4, 5, 7; Form Response) \nApplicant stated that in his SCA he was working with a debt consolidation \ncompany (Company A) to resolve his debts. He also stated that Company A provided \nhim with financial counseling. In his response to interrogatories, he acknowledged that \nhe had not paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. He stated that he and his spouse \nintended to pay their smaller debts first before tackling the larger ones. He noted in his \nJune 2022 personal financial statement (PFS) that he allotted a monthly payment of \n$623 to Company A. He stated in his Form Response that he and his spouse were in \ntouch with their creditors. He also stated that they listed their home for sale, and they \nintended to use any profit to resolve their debts. He also stated that they were \ndownsizing to reduce their monthly expenses, and they intended to sell the car that he \npurchased with the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a and use the profit to resolve the outstanding loan \nbalance. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his efforts to resolve his \ndebts through Company A, to include any payments he has made to date to Company \nA, and he did not provide documentation to corroborate his efforts to resolve his debts \ndirectly with the creditors. (Items 3, 7; Form Response) \nApplicant\u2019s June 2022 PFS reflects a net monthly income of $12,662. After \nexpenses, to include the monthly allotment of $623 to Company A, his monthly net \nremainder was $306. The July 2023 credit bureau report lists three additional charged-\noff credit cards, for $2,013, $7,275, and $12,282, respectively, that are not alleged in \nthe SOR. I will not consider these unalleged debts in evaluating the disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline; however, I will consider this information in my mitigation \nand whole-person analysis. (Item 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and, AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not \npaying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely  \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his delinquent debts. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Applicant failed to provide documentation to corroborate his efforts \nto resolve his debts, and he has incurred additional delinquent debts as evidenced by \nthe 2023 credit bureau report. Although he stated that Company A provided him with \ncredit counseling, there are not clear indications that his financial problems are being \nresolved or are under control. I find that Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems continue \nto cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established . \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He \nwas married to his first wife from 1991 until 2002 when they divorced, and they have two \nadult sons who are financially independent and serving in the U.S. military. In December \n2019, he received a Bachelor of Science in business administration and a certificate in \nentrepreneurship. He has worked as a secured communications analyst for a DOD \ncontractor since December 2022. He enlisted in the United States Navy in 1988 as a \nSeabee, served one year in the Reserves, and four years on active duty.

He does not currently have a security \nclearance. (Tr. 12-13, 26-31, 33-36; GE 1; GE 2; AE Y) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer, he admitted all the debts except for SOR \u00b6 1.h; however, \nall his positive responses were qualified by language that his debts had been settled, paid \nin full, or a settlement had been reached and they would be paid off shortly. Therefore, I \nam considering these answers to be de facto denials. He also denied the two Guideline \nJ allegations and indicated they were dismissed. (Answer; AE I) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was a credit card account opened in 2018 and \ncharged off in 2021. A judgment was filed against Applicant in 2022 in the amount of \n$22,277. At the hearing, he testified he entered into a payment agreement with the \ncreditor in September 2022 to make monthly payments of $376, and his wife was \nnegotiating with the creditor to settle the debt for a lump-sum payment. His April 2023 \ncredit bureau report (CBR) reflects a balance of $20,168, indicating he did make \npayments. After the hearing, he provided documentation from the creditor demonstrating \nhe made a $10,000 payment between April 10, 2023 and May 2, 2023, and settled this \ndebt. It is resolved.

(Tr. 69-70; AE D; AE E; AE R) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife\u2019s four bouts with cancer, his \nunder and unemployment, and a failed business. His wife has been unable to work since \napproximately 2018. In addition to her lost income, costs related to uncovered transplant \nmedications, chemotherapy, and travel for her treatment affected their finances. Her latest \nillness also coincided with the period he returned to school full time (2017 to 2019). They \nrelied on his education benefits from his military service (GI Bill) and his Navy retirement \nand VA disability pay. However, they had insufficient income for their needs, and they \nused credit cards to support themselves and pay for her necessary medications. (Tr. 18-\n19, 36-39, 56-58; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 9; AE Y) \nApplicant was unemployed from June 2017 to December 2019, while he was a full-\ntime student, and from December 2019 until March 2020, when he was preparing to open \na restaurant, with his parents\u2019 financial support. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic he was \nunable to make the business successful and despite multiple attempts, he shut it down in \nOctober 2021. He was subsequently unemployed until January 2022. Additionally, since \nretiring from the Navy, he struggled to find a position in his field, because he lacked a \ncollege degree. (Tr. 27-28, 41, 56, 63-66, 76-78; GE 1 at 10; GE 2 at 2-3) \nApplicant does not have any new delinquent debt, and he provided documentation \ndemonstrating he resolved several large unalleged debts. When he and his wife moved \nfrom State A to State B in November 2021, they moved in with his parents to reduce their \nexpenses and save money. They were subsequently able to make payments and resolve \nsome of their debts in the fall of 2022. In April 2023, he and his wife sold their home in \nState A and used the proceeds to resolve their remaining debts.

As of the hearing date, he nets a monthly income of $6,000 \nfrom his civilian position ($105,000 salary) and approximately $2,076 from his combined \nretirement and disability pay.

(GE 2; GE 9; AE U)  \nApplicant received the following awards and decorations while serving on active \nduty in the Navy: Army Commendation Medal; Joint Meritorious Unit Award; Navy Unit \nCommendation Medal; Navy \u201cE\u201d Ribbon; Navy Good Conduct Medal (5); National \nDefense Service Medal (2); Southwest Asia Service Medal; Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal; Global War on Terrorism Medal; Navy Sea Service Deployment \nRibbon (5); Navy Sharpshooter Rifle Medal; and Navy Sharpshooter Pistol Medal.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Concerns \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant experienced personal financial issues related in large part to his wife\u2019s \ncancer (her loss of income and additional expenses for treatments), and personal periods \nof under and unemployment. After retiring from the Navy in 2012 as a CTT1, he was \nunable to find a position in his field because he lacked a college degree. While he was in \nschool full time to obtain a degree, his wife became ill again, and their income was \ninsufficient. These were circumstances that were not within his control. Just before the \nCovid-19 pandemic started, he attempted to open a restaurant; however, he ultimately \nhad to close it in October 2021. After obtaining a position in his field in January 2022, he \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas able to save money by living with his parents. In the fall of 2022, he made payments \ntoward and resolved several of the alleged delinquent debts. After he sold his home in \nApril 2023, he used the proceeds to resolve the remaining alleged debts. Additionally, he \nalso resolved several unalleged debts prior to the issuance of the SOR, demonstrating a \ngood-faith effort. The record evidence reflects that the debts alleged in the SOR are \nresolved. \nApplicant pays his current financial obligations and has no new delinquent debt. \nHe is willing and able to live within his means, which is reflected in the testimonial and \ndocumentary evidence. Mitigation was established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d). \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nThe record evidence did not establish sufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s criminal \ncharges were disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 31: \n(a) pattern of minor offenses, any of which on its own would be unlikely to \naffect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe two alleged incidents do not establish a pattern of behavior or offenses. As of \nthe hearing date, it was almost three years since the last underlying conduct occurred. \nTogether, the two incidents do not establish doubt regarding Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record regarding the October 2020 event to \ndetermine if the complaining witness made a credible allegation. Applicant testified he \nwas the one who was assaulted; the charges were made approximately eight months \nafter the incident; and dismissed shortly thereafter. \nThe circumstances surrounding the 2019 incident and Applicant\u2019s explanation are \nwith merit. He and his wife purchased $200 worth of merchandise and failed to pay for \nthree smaller items, totaling $19. They forgot these items were in the upper basket under \nhis wife\u2019s purse in the shopping cart. It is commonplace for shoppers to place smaller \nitems in the upper basket area of a cart to prevent them from falling through the slats of \nthe larger lower area. The Navy Exchange did not accept their explanation and charges \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nwere filed against them, but the record does not establish a credible accusation.

There is \ninsufficient evidence in the record to establish Applicant engaged in criminal conduct. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under the guidelines at issue in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and J and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nat issue. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security of the United States to grant him eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information.

Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 provides one personal conduct condition that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in relation to her provision of inaccurate information on \nher SCA: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nApplicant did not disclose on her June 12, 2021 SCA that she received written \nwarnings or reprimands and she was terminated from employment with Employers A and \nB. The questions about termination of employment and receipt of reprimands or warnings \nare straight forward and easy to understand. She knew her answers were false at the \ntime she provided them. She provided a false reason for leaving the employment of \nEmployers A and B, that is, she falsely said she left due to downsizing.  \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about [her] intent and state of mind when [she] executed \n[her] Security Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they [are] not binding on \nthe Administrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd.

Feb. 14, 2019), the Appeal \nBoard recognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification \ncases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd.

This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of:  . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing . . . . \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3) and 16(e)(1) apply to Applicant\u2019s reprimands or warnings and \nterminations from employment by Employer A. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3) and 16(e)(1) apply to her \nreprimands or warnings during her employment by Employer B, but not to her termination \nfrom employment with Employer B. \nNone of the disqualifying conditions apply to Employer B\u2019s termination of \nApplicant\u2019s employment. On July 20, 2020, the state unemployment agency wrote, \u201cThe \nclaimant was not discharged for just cause. Insufficient information has been provided to \nestablish that the employer had just cause to discharge the claimant.\u201d (SOR response) \nThe allegation that her termination from employment with Employer B was due to her \nunsatisfactory performance is refuted. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Those errors have \nnot recurred for more than seven years. She does not work with inmates or parolees. She \nhas a fianc\u00e9e.

Applicant \nbelieves that waiting 58 days to report accurate information on her SCA is sufficiently \nprompt to mitigate security concerns under AG \u00b6 17(a). I disagree. Her false statements \non her SCA continue to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old semi-tractor trailer driver, and she has held this \nemployment with her current employer for two years. The week before her hearing, she \nreceived a safety award from her current employer. In 2007, she received an associate \ndegree in human services. In 2010, she received bachelor\u2019s degrees in criminology and \npsychology. \nApplicant said she has ensured that sensitive information is safeguarded \nthroughout her employment history. She was honest to the OPM investigator, in her SOR \nresponse, and at her hearing about admitting \u201cthe lies that [she] put\u201d on her SCA. (Tr. 47) \nHer mistakes as indicated on the SOR do not define her as a person. She promised to \ncarry out her assigned duties. Her difficulties with her employers are not recent, and they \nwere not a pattern. She promised to carefully and accurately fill out her SCAs in the future. \nThere is no evidence of employment problems at her current employment. \nThe factors weighing against granting her security clearance are more substantial \nthan the mitigating circumstances. Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on her \nJune 12, 2021 SCA in her response to the questions in Section 13A, Employment \nActivities. In addition to denying receipt of warnings or reprimands during her employment \nwith Employer A and B, she said her terminations from those employments were the result \nof downsizing. She is credited with revealing the truth to the OPM investigator 58 days \nlater. This belated truthful disclosure was not soon enough to qualify as a prompt \ndisclosure under AG \u00b6 17(a). \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more time without conduct raising a serious concern, she may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e through 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant admits to each of the delinquent accounts listed in the SOR. Credit \nReports of Applicant dated May 27, 2022; and March 16, 2023, confirm the \nindebtedness listed in the SOR. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from December 1986 to January \n1990. He then joined the Navy reserves where he served for three years. He received \nan honorable discharge. While in the military he held a security clearance without \nincident. \nAfter leaving the military, Applicant worked a few jobs and then in 1994, got into  \nan electrical apprenticeship which allowed him to work and go to school.  He also took \nclasses in industrial controls.  In 1996, he decided to start his own company doing \nindustrial controls.  By 1998, he decided to start a partnership business venture with a \nfriend he met in the Navy, who married his mother and who became Applicant\u2019s step-\nfather.  The business was successful from 1998 until 2017, when Applicant was forced \nto close the doors.  As a result of the downturn in the economy, Applicant\u2019s business \npartnership venture, followed by a period of self-employment, caused Applicant to \nbecome delinquently indebted and unable to pay his debts.  Applicant started working \nfor a defense contractor in April 2022, and a month later, he applied for a security \nclearance.  He currently earns about $162,000 annually.     \nThe following delinquent debts listed in the SOR remain owing: \n1.a. \nA delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $25,682. This was Applicant\u2019s personal credit card that he used \nto finance his self-employment after closing his business.

This was a Home Depot credit card that Applicant used \nfor business items. The debt remains owing. (Tr. p. 57.) \n1.f. \nA delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $367.

This is for Applicant\u2019s primary residence which was \ngoing to be foreclosed upon. \nApplicant contacted the lender and has set up a \nrepayment agreement. \nApplicant stated that since August 2022, he has followed the \nterms of the repayment agreement and has reduced what he owes on both the first and \nsecond loans on the property to about $77,000. (Tr. p. 60.) \n1.h. \nA delinquent mortgage account was reported as past due in the \napproximate amount of $1,324 with a balance of $2,022. This was a mortgage on a \nhome Applicant owns in Alaska. He stated that he has paid the debt in full. (Tr. p. 26.) \n1.i. A delinquent credit card debt was reported as past due in the approximate \namount of $632, with a balance of $3,588.

A judgment was filed against the Applicant in 2017 in the approximate \namount of $1,511,304. Applicant was sued by his business partner, who was a friend of \nthe Applicant\u2019s he met in the Navy; who is a year older than Applicant; and who married \nApplicant\u2019s mother. Applicant and his partner operated a business together from 1998 \nto 2017. Applicant\u2019s partner sued Applicant for breach of fiduciary duty claiming that \nApplicant was improperly paying or running his personal expenses through the \ncompany. There was no formal agreement between the parties. Applicant performed \nall of the industrial control work and his partner or stepfather, did electrical work. \nApplicant explained that from the beginning he worked full time and much harder than \nhis partner, who worked only part-time and did less difficult jobs, working only when he \nwanted to. Applicant also generated most of the clientele base for the company. (Tr. \npp. 36-45.) \nIn 2010, Applicant caught his mother stealing from the company. When she was \nsupposed to be helping out by doing the \u201cbooks\u201d, and was showing that the company \nwas paying a vendor for something, she was actually writing a check to herself or her \nhusband, Applicant\u2019s business partner. Over the years the company prospered, but it \ntook a significant hit during the economic slowdown in 2008, and business significantly \ndecreased. At this point, debts mounted and grew out of control. Applicant stated that \nhe worked single handedly to pay off the company debt, and he tried to keep the \nbusiness open for as long as he could. In 2017, Applicant closed the business. (Tr. pp. \n35-45.) \nApplicant denies that he has ever done anything wrong in handling the business \naffairs. To defend himself in litigation, Applicant hired an attorney, which cost him about \n$70,000 over a six-month period. He then hired a second attorney to review things, and \nwas told that he had a simple accounting case and needed an accountant. Applicant \nran out of money before being able to do more, and his attorney walked away. \nApplicant stated that he does not have the money to pay the judgment and he has no \nintention of paying it. (Tr. pp. 51-52.) \nApplicant explained that his mother is currently divorcing the man who was his \nbusiness partner. If his mother\u2019s divorce results in her getting control of the court \njudgment against him, Applicant\u2019s mother has agreed to vacate it or settle it against the \nApplicant. Applicant stated that he will then do the right thing and take out a second \nmortgage on his house in Alaska and make offers with his creditors to settle the debts. \n(Tr. p. 57.) At this time, however, there is no documentary evidence to show that \nApplicant has done anything to resolve his delinquent debt. \nApplicant was self-employed as a Control Systems Integrator from 2017 until \nNovember 2021, when he broke his hip, and was unable to work. He had no one to \ncover for him and he lost his customers.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial indebtedness. His answer to the SOR, his \ntestimony, as well as his credit reports, clearly confirm this indebtedness. Applicant has \nnot, for the most part, resolved his delinquent debts and they remain owing. Applicant \nfailed to provide any documentary evidence to show that any of his delinquent debts are \nbeing resolved in any fashion. Although he testified that he has made payments on \neach of his two delinquent mortgages, and has paid off one of them in full, he has \nprovided no documentary evidence to substantiate his testimony. \nApplicant has \nsubmitted no documentary evidence at all. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant explained that he became excessively indebted due to problems \nrelated to his business venture followed by a period of self-employment where he did \nnot earn enough to support his expenses. Since then, and after becoming employed full \ntime with a defense contractor, he has done little to nothing to resolve his delinquent \ndebt. He is currently waiting to see the outcome of his mother\u2019s divorce from his ex-\nbusiness partner to determine what he plans to do about his delinquent debts. He may \nfile Bankruptcy and/or he may obtain a second on his mortgage loan to pay off debt. He \nis not sure. Under the particular circumstances here, Applicant has failed to establish \nthat he has acted reasonably or responsibly with respect to his debts. \nWithout \ndocumentation to substantiate his testimony, as it stands, Applicant has done nothing to \nresolve his debts. Furthermore, he has not demonstrated that future financial problems \nare unlikely. But, most importantly, it has not been demonstrated that his current \nfinancial problems are under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThere is nothing in the record to indicate when Applicant\u2019s financial indebtedness \nwill be resolved, and whether it is likely to recur. There is insufficient documentation in \nthe record to show that Applicant can control his finances and live within his means \nwithout difficulty. He remains excessively indebted. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. There is insufficient documentation in the \nrecord to show that Applicant has made any effort to resolve or work toward resolving \nhis delinquent debt. Accordingly, Applicant has not demonstrated that he is financially \nresponsible. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(Item 3 at 37) Though he claimed in his January \n2023 answer to the SOR that there were long periods when he did not use the drug, he \nindicated in his October 2022 PSI that he used marijuana three or four times a year \nbetween 2007 and 2018. He stated that he last used the drug in 2021 at a music \nconcert. He declared that he did not intend to use illegal drugs in the future because he \nchanged his lifestyle to be a better parent. Applicant knew that he was not to use \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance (Item 5 at 4; January 2023 answer to \nSOR), but used the drug anyway. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 In his July 2022 e-QIP, Applicant acknowledged using cocaine a \nfew times from October 2016 to 2017.

(Item 3 \nat 41) In his January 2023 answer to the SOR, he rationalized his occasional marijuana \nuse while possessing a security clearance as not a serious infraction. Unlike his \noverseas deployment (November 2009 to June 2010) when he had regular access to \nclassified information and was not using any illegal drugs, after his return from \ndeployment, he had little contact with classified information, and did not view his \nconduct away from work to be subject to stringent controls. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f (cocaine), 1.g (Adderall) \u2013 Applicant used cocaine and \nunprescribed Adderall to improve his emotional condition at the end a ten-year \nmarriage.

SOR \u00b6 1.d is mitigated by the \nisolated use, the passage of time since January 2006, and the fact that Applicant had \nno security clearance when he used the mushrooms in college. See also Item 3 at 38-\n39 and Item 5 at 4. \nIn the last paragraph of his January 2023 answer to the SOR, Applicant \ninterpreted the voluntary disclosure of his past illegal drug use as redemptive to show \nthat he again qualifies for security clearance eligibility. See January 2023 answer to \nSOR. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available \nand reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 12564 signed by the then-President of the United States on September 15, \n1986. The primary positions addressed in the E.O. are: (1) federal employees cannot \nuse illegal drugs; (2) illegal drug use by federal employees, on or off duty, is contrary to \nthe efficiency of the service; and (3) persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for \nfederal employment. \nI have also taken administrative notice of the Director of National Intelligence \nMemorandum Adherence of Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, (October 25, \n2014), which clearly stated that state laws do not authorize persons to violate federal \nlaw. Including the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which \nidentified marijuana as a Schedule 1 controlled drug. \nChanges in state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use \ndo not change the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017). An individual\u2019s disregard of the \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana involvement remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. Agencies are required to \nemploy the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine if an applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant began using marijuana in 2004. Following his regular marijuana use \nin college, he continued to use the drug three or four times a year until 2018.

Even though he may not have \npurchased the drug, he still had to possess or have control over the drug to use it. If \nApplicant\u2019s isolated use of mushrooms had been the only illegal drug that Applicant \nused, his drug use could have been mitigated. However, Applicant also used cocaine \nabout six times in 2017. Furthermore, he used the prescription drug Adderall a few \ntimes in 2017. His use of all the drugs occurred after he had been granted a security \nclearance in November 2009. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nWhile the Applicant\u2019s marijuana usage apparently stopped in 2021, he used the \ndrug regularly from 2004 to 2006. He used the drug occasionally between 2007 and \n2018, and once again in 2021. He used the illegal drugs and the unprescribed drug \nwhile holding a security clearance. He knew that illegal drug use was against federal \nlaw. His continued use of illegal drugs for nine years after receiving his security \nclearance raises continuing doubt regarding his judgment and reliability. AG \u00b6 26(a) \ndoes not apply. \nThough Applicant admits his involvement with marijuana and the other listed \ndrugs, he has furnished no independent evidence of action taken to overcome his illegal \ndrug use, with an objective directed at abstinence from all drugs. While he indicated that \nhe has severed all ties with drug users and changed his lifestyle to be a better role \nmodel as a parent, he made that same statement in September 2009 when he fervently \ndeclared a similar position as he continued to use marijuana for another nine years. AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(1) does not apply. I am unable to conclude one way or the other whether \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has successfully changed his environment. AG \u00b6 26(b)(2) does not apply. \nLastly, the record contains no signed statement of intent by Applicant that any future \ndrug involvement will constitute grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(3) is inapplicable. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, \nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally \nresult in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation or further processing for \nnational security eligibility.  \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that he may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient \nconfidentiality, release \nof \nproprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information \u2026 \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement has independent significance under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) \nand 16 (d)(3) because his drug involvement demonstrates questionable judgment and \nan unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. The condition requires a prompt, good-faith effort to \ncorrect the omission. While Applicant finally revealed his drug involvement in October \n2022, this disclosure occurred after he had intentionally concealed his illegal drug use \nfrom 2006 (e-QIP, Item 4) to October 2022. (PSI, Item 5). Considering the evidence in \nits totality, Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his overall drug use was neither prompt nor made in \ngood faith. \nApplicant\u2019s falsification in November 2009 of his illegal marijuana use was not \nminor and continues to raise doubts about his trustworthiness, reliability and good \njudgment. Though he has acknowledged his illegal drug use and misuse of an \nunprescribed drug, he knew that such drug involvement conflicted with federal law, but \nused the drugs anyway. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 37 years old. He has an eight-year-old son. He plans to marry his \nfianc\u00e9. He has been working for his employer since July 2008. He began as a data \nanalyst and is currently and associate principal for his emplyer. \nThe favorable evidence supporting security eligibility is insufficient to overcome \nthe countervailing evidence. Applicant illegally used marijuana between 2004 and \nNovember 2021. He used cocaine and Adderall in 2016 and 2017. Although his use of \nthese two drugs was infrequent and were triggered by the approaching end of his \nmarriage, the use occurred after he had been awarded a security clearance in \nNovember 2009. Holding a security clearance is a 24-hour-responsibilty which requires \ncomplying with all federal laws at work and after work, even when the clearance is \ninactive, and regardless of the amount of classified information the holder may handle at \na given time. Even though some states have decriminalized marijuana use, it is still \nillegal at the federal level. After weighing the entire record under the whole person, \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation odes not overcome the drug involvement and \npersonal conduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-c, e-g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant (Under \n2.b, Subparagraph 1.d is found for Applicant) \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted the Guideline E allegations in the SOR, with explanations. In his written answer to the amended SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation, however, during his hearing testimony, when asked about what his response to the amended SOR allegation was, he denied it. I take from the evidence that he was trying to explain that he admitted that he was accused of the conduct, but he denied engaging in the conduct. That is the manner in which I will consider this admission under Guideline D. As to the Guideline E admissions, I adopt them as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. (Tr. 11-12; HE I, IV) Applicant is 61 years old. He is married and has 10 children. He works in information technology for his current employer. He holds two bachelor\u2019s degrees.

(Hearing exhibit (HE) I) The Applicant \nanswered the amended SOR allegation on March 28, 2023. (HE IV) \nThe case was assigned to me on July 11, 2023. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 25, 2023, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on September 12, 2023. The Government offered exhibits (GE) \n1-2. All offered exhibits were admitted without objection. The Government\u2019s discovery \nletter and exhibit index were marked HE II and III respectively. Applicant testified, but \ndid not offer any exhibits. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 22, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted the Guideline E allegations in the SOR, with \nexplanations. In his written answer to the amended SOR, Applicant admitted the \nallegation, however, during his hearing testimony, when asked about what his response \nto the amended SOR allegation was, he denied it. I take from the evidence that he was \ntrying to explain that he admitted that he was accused of the conduct, but he denied \nengaging in the conduct. That is the manner in which I will consider this admission \nunder Guideline D. As to the Guideline E admissions, I adopt them as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. (Tr. 11-12; HE I, IV) \nApplicant is 61 years old. He is married and has 10 children. He works in \ninformation technology for his current employer. He holds two bachelor\u2019s degrees. (Tr. \n6; 34; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline E, The SOR alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his \nOctober 2021 security clearance application (SCA) when he answered \u201cno\u201d when asked \nif in the last seven years he had been fired from a job, quit after being told he would be \nfired, or left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct when he \nfailed to disclose that he left his employment in May 2017 by mutual agreement after he \nwas accused of masturbating in his employer\u2019s bathroom. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant made false statements to an investigator in \nFebruary 2022, during his background interview. Those statements included: that he left \nhis employment in May 2017 because he secured a job elsewhere; that the reason he \nleft his employment in May 2017 was not related to conduct or disciplinary action; and \nthat he left his employment in May 2017 due to personality differences with the new \nmanager. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nUnder Guideline D, the amended SOR alleged in May 2017, Applicant was \naccused of masturbating in the bathroom of this employer, a church. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nFrom August 2013 to May 2017, Applicant worked as a network engineer for a \nlocal church. He and his family were also members of this church.

While he did not provide the specific \nlanguage of this clause, he stated that it was very strict. His interpretation of the clause \nwas that an allegation of misconduct alone was sufficient to trigger the clause and end \nhis employment. In May 2017, he was called to a meeting of the church elder\u2019s and told \nhe had been accused of masturbating in the church\u2019s bathroom. He denied this act \nbefore the elders. His accuser(s) was not made known to him and he was unaware if an \ninvestigation took place because of the allegation. If one did occur, he was not apprised \nof it. Based upon the allegation, the church terminated his employment. (Tr. 23-24, 28, \n36; GE 2) \nApplicant claims that the terms of his termination were that if he chose not to \ndispute the termination, he would receive several weeks of paid insurance after he left \nand a small severance payment. Applicant stated that he did not want to fight the \ntermination or cause any trouble for the church. He also believed that he and the church \nagreed that if either was asked about the circumstances of his leaving, they would state \nthat he left for another job rather than advance the true reason he left, i.e., the \nmasturbation allegation. (Tr. 23) \nIn October 2021, Applicant completed a SCA while working for his current \nemployer. In response to questions about his employment record (Section 13C), \nApplicant was asked whether he had been fired from a job, quit a job after being told he \nwould be fired, or if he left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of \nmisconduct. He answered \u201cno\u201d to this question. Earlier in the SCA, in Section 13A, \nApplicant listed his former employment with the church. He listed two reasons for \nleaving this employment. Those reasons were that he received another job offer and \nthat his contract with the church had ended. He also answered \u201cno\u201d under this section to \nthe question of whether he left this employment because he had been fired from the job, \nquit the job after being told he would be fired, or if he left the job by mutual agreement \nfollowing allegations of misconduct. Applicant admitted he answered this way because \nof the agreement he had with the church where both parties would conceal the true \nnature of his termination. He claimed he was trying to protect the church\u2019s reputation as \nwell as his. (Tr. 23-24; GE 1; SOR answer) \nIn February 2022, Applicant was interviewed as part of his background \ninvestigation. He was asked why he left the church\u2019s employment, and he told the \ninvestigator that he \u201creceived a job elsewhere.\u201d He was then asked if he had any \nconduct issues or disciplinary actions when he was employed by the church, to which \nhe said \u201cno.\u201d He was then told that the investigation revealed that he left the church by \nmutual agreement due to specific reasons. Applicant responded to this by stating that \nhe decided to leave the church by mutual agreement because of personality differences \nwith his new manager. Applicant then admitted to the investigator that he left by mutual \nagreement because he was accused of masturbating in the bathroom at work. Applicant \nadmitted that it was only after being confronted by the investigator about the true nature \nof his termination and his realization that the church had not lived up to their agreement \nnot to disclose the true reason for his termination that he disclosed the truth to the \ninvestigator.

They promised me only the best recommendations. They, in fact, \ngave me recommendations to several other jobs that I had on the list. So I \nwas surprised when the adjudicator [sic] presented me with the \ninformation that they had answered differently then they told me they \nwould. (Tr. 25) \nApplicant admitted the allegation that he was accused of masturbating in \nthe bathroom of the church, but he denied that he actually did the act itself. No \nother evidence was offered by the Government establishing this allegation under \nGuideline D. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and   \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to deliberately providing false information on his October \n2021 SCA and during his February 2022 background interview with an investigator \nsatisfy both disqualifying conditions. The deliberateness of his action is established by \nhis belief that he and the church made a sub rosa agreement not to disclose the true \nnature of his termination. It was only after he was confronted by the investigator and \nlearned that the church did not honor the sub rosa agreement that he disclosed the true \ncircumstances of his termination. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and   \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant admitted that he did not reveal the true circumstances about his \ntermination from the church until he was confronted by the investigator during his \nbackground interview. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nDeliberately providing false information on a SCA and during a background \ninterview is not a minor offense and his action occurred as recently as 2022. A more \ntroubling aspect of Applicant\u2019s actions is his willingness enter and abide by a sub rosa \nagreement with the church not to disclose the true nature of his termination. His actions \nin this regard cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 \n17(c) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant acknowledged his behavior by admitting his past \nfalsifications, he failed to provide any information that shows he has taken positive steps \nto change that behavior. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that such behavior is \nunlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment or \ndiscretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. These issues, together or individually, may raise questions about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Sexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in \nthis Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe allegation under Guideline D alleges that Applicant was accused of \nmasturbating in the bathroom at church where he worked. That allegation, if true, would \ncertainly fall under the above listed disqualifying conditions. However, Applicant denied \nthe conduct and there is no evidence in the record except for an anonymous allegation \nmade to church officials. No investigation concerning the allegation was disclosed to \nApplicant. Based upon the record evidence, I conclude that the Guideline D allegation \nwas not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. The guideline D allegation was not established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

On February 14, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency (DCSA), formerly the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility, sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline H. The DCSA acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 17, 2023, and requested a decision \nbased on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

Although Item 5 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, \nI conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 5. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of her right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 5 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if she \ndid not raise an objection to Item 5 in her response to the FORM, or if she did not respond \nto the FORM, she could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item \n5 could be considered as evidence in her case. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 51, is unmarried with a minor child. She received her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2007. She worked as a detective for a large metropolitan city police department \nin State A from 1993 to 2013. Since 2013, she has been self-employed as a private \ninvestigator. She relocated her residence from State A to State B in 2016. In June 2021, \nshe was hired into a contract investigator position by the defense contractor who \nsponsored her EQIP. The record did not address whether Applicant either submitted to a \npreemployment drug test or was advised of a drug-free policy upon hire. DCSA granted \nher interim eligibility for a secret clearance on August 8, 2022. As of September 27, 2022, \nshe had not yet begun employment in the position for which eligibility was granted. (Items \n3-5) \nApplicant did not disclose any drug use on her July 25, 2022 EQIP. She answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to all questions in \u201cSection 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity,\u201d including \nwhether she had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances within the last seven \nyears, while possessing a security clearance, or while employed as a law enforcement \nofficer. The opening paragraph of Section 23 noted that all questions pertained to the \nillegal use of drugs or controlled substances \u201cin accordance with Federal laws, even \nthough permissible under state laws.\u201d The question about \u201cillegal use of drugs or \ncontrolled substances\u201d in Section 23 noted, \u201cUse of a drug or controlled substance \nincludes injecting, snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise \nconsuming any drug or controlled substance.\u201d (Item 3) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s September 27, 2022 security clearance interview (SI), she self-\nreported that she experimented with marijuana twice after completing the EQIP, on an \nunspecified date in July 2022, and on an unspecified date in September 2022. On each \noccasion, she inhaled one hit of marijuana from a vaping pen supplied by a friend while \nattending a concert. She attributed her decision to use marijuana to the fact that it is legal \nin State B.

She maintained that she never used \nany other illegal drugs or marijuana on any other occasions. She professed an intent not \nto use marijuana in the future because it could affect her security clearance. (Item 2, 5) \nAlthough not explicitly stated, information in the record implied that both concerts \nApplicant attended were in State B. In her Answer, she reiterated that, to the best of her \nknowledge, her marijuana use was legal under State B law. The Government did not \nproffer evidence to the contrary. She maintained that she would never have used \nmarijuana had she known that its use was illegal under federal law. The record did not \nindicate when or how she acquired that knowledge. (Items 5) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005)). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use in July and September 2022 establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions set forth under this guideline in AG \u00b6 25 this guideline: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe SOR did not allege facts to establish the disqualifying condition set forth in AG \n\u00b6 25 (f) (any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position). Although Applicant was granted interim eligibility for a security \nclearance in August 2022, the record did not establish that she was either working in a \nsensitive position or had otherwise been granted access to classified information when \nshe used marijuana. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nI considered all the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following warrant some discussion: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nI sua sponte took administrative notice of the following facts relevant to the parties\u2019 \nrespective positions: 1) recreational possession and use of up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana \nby adults over the age of 21 has been legal in State B since July 2021; 2) marijuana \nremains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law; 3) changes in the laws \npertaining to marijuana by states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the \nAG; and 4) federal marijuana laws supersede state marijuana laws. \nI also considered the October 2014 guidance issued by the Director of National \nIntelligence (DNI) which advised, \u201c[a]n individual\u2019s disregard of federal law concerning the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security \ndeterminations.\u201d The DNI updated its guidance in December 2021 to reaffirm that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to marijuana use, possession, production, and \ndistribution; and that individuals who hold security clearances or occupy a sensitive \nposition within the federal government are currently prohibited by law from using \ncontrolled substances, such as marijuana, on or off-duty. The updated guidance made \nclear that prior recreational marijuana use by an individual applying for a security \nclearance or national security position might be relevant to adjudications, but not \ndeterminative. The guidance instructed federal agencies to adjudicate each potential \napplicant through a \"whole-person concept\" by evaluating multiple variables in an \nindividual's life to determine whether past marijuana use raises a security concern and \nwhether that concern has been mitigated. \nApplicant\u2019s two-time use of marijuana could be considered innocuous in any other \ncontext since it was legal in her home state. However, in evaluating security worthiness, \nher decision to use marijuana at all is problematic. Further exacerbating the concern are \nthe timing and circumstances of her marijuana use, especially as a former law \nenforcement officer. She chose to use marijuana for the first time within days of \ncompleting an EQIP that contained plain language placing her on notice of the security \nconcerns associated with drug use, regardless of its legality under state law. I am troubled \nby her claimed ignorance, at the time she used marijuana, that its use remains illegal \nunder federal law, particularly given her law enforcement background. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhether or not Applicant knew at the time she used marijuana, she has since \nacknowledged that marijuana use is both illegal under federal law and incompatible with \nmaintaining a security clearance. However, she cited the potential impact on her security \nclearance, and not its illegality, as her motivation to abstain from future marijuana use. \nShe did not provide the signed statement of intent described in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nWithout having an opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor and ask questions, \nI am unable to assess her credibility. Considering the record as a whole, I am unable to \nconclude that her marijuana use is unlikely to recur. I also have doubts about her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment, and her willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Accordingly, I conclude that she failed to meet her burden to establish \nmitigation sufficient to overcome the recency and circumstances of her marijuana use. \nNeither AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) nor 26(b) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis, \nand considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) and the DNI\u2019s December 2021 guidance. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated her marijuana use. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He is 45 years old. He \nmarried in 1999, divorced in 2020, and he has two minor children. He has owned his \nhome since December 2019. He earned an associate degree in 2006. He has worked \nas a design engineering manager for his current employer since May 2022. He has \nnever held a security clearance. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from approximately April 1996 \nto at least December 2022. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He used marijuana after completing his security \nclearance application in June 2022. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He intends to use marijuana in the \nfuture. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) He first used marijuana in April 1996, and he used marijuana \nsporadically thereafter. Since December 2019, he used marijuana monthly to \nsporadically, at home with friends. It made him feel relaxed. Initially, his friends \npurchased the marijuana but since December 2019, he has purchased marijuana for his \nown consumption. He likened his use of marijuana to the way that people consume \nalcohol socially. He indicated that his marijuana use has not had a negative impact on \nhim, and he would not rule out if he would continue to use marijuana. He indicated that \nrecreational marijuana use is legal in his state. (Answer; Items 1-2, 4) \nApplicant did not disclose the information about his marijuana use during his first \nbackground interview on August 11, 2022. He contacted the investigator and disclosed \nthis information during his second background interview on August 24, 2022. He stated \nin his January 2023 response to interrogatories that he intended to use marijuana in the \nfuture, and that his employer\u2019s policy is to abstain from illegal drug use. In his Answer, \nhe stated that his recreational use of marijuana is during his personal time, and he \nreiterated the possibility that he might continue using marijuana in the future. (Answer; \nItems 1-2, 4) \nApplicant did not disclose his drug involvement in response to section 23 of his \n2022 SCA, which inquired about illegal use of drugs or drug activity. He marked \u201cNo,\u201d \nand did not disclose his marijuana use in response to a question that inquired whether \nhe had illegally used any drug or controlled substances in the last seven years, and to a \nquestion that inquired whether he had been involved in the illegal purchase, \nmanufacture, cultivate, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, handling or \nsale of any drug or controlled substance in the last seven years. (SOR \u00b6 2.a; Items 1-3) \nHe indicated during his second background interview that he did not disclose his \nmarijuana use on his 2022 SCA because he did not feel comfortable disclosing it.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ;\u201d \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d and \n\u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \nApplicant used marijuana from 1996 to 2022. He used marijuana after he \ncompleted his SCA in June 2022. He also intends to use marijuana in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; and \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused. \nApplicant used marijuana from 1996 to 2022, he used marijuana after he \ncompleted his SCA in June 2022, and he intends to use marijuana in the future. I find \nthat none of the above mitigating conditions are established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant marked \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose his marijuana use and purchase in \nresponse to relevant questions in section 23 of his 2022 SCA. He admitted that he did \nnot disclose this information because he did not feel comfortable doing so. AG \u00b6 16(a) is \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating condition: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nWhen Applicant was initially interviewed by a background investigator in August \n2022, he did not disclose information regarding his marijuana involvement. He did \ncontact the investigator and disclose this information during his second interview in \nAugust 2022. As such, he made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct his omission \nregarding his relevant drug use on his 2022 SCA. AG \u00b6 17(a) is established for SOR \u00b6 \n2.a. However, although he disclosed his marijuana use during his second background \ninterview in August 2022 background interview, he lied about it on his 2022 SCA and \nduring his first background interview in August 2022. His omissions are not minor, and \nthey occurred recently, in 2022. While he expressed his regret over his false answers, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis deliberate omissions in his SCA raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. As such, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the personal conduct and drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all nine financial allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i, without comment. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 52-year-old logistics technician working full time with a defense contractor since February 2022. He worked with a different defense contractor from November 2018 through January 2022. He stated he was unemployed for about a month when that contract ended. From March 2015 through about October 2017, Applicant worked as a commercial driver. He disclosed he was summarily dismissed from the position after he declined to take on new stops which, he stated, would have increased his workload beyond his existing 11\u201312-hour workday. He stated he was unemployed for about nine months prior to accepting a position in July 2018, where he worked as a lead housekeeper, until finding a new position more related to his technical field in November 2018. (Items 3 and 6) During his periods of unemployment, Applicant stated he was supported by unemployment benefits and savings from his 401(k)-retirement plan. No additional information was provided concerning potential tax consequences created by his early withdrawal of his 401(k)-retirement funds.

He received the FORM on May \n11, 2023 and did not respond. The case was assigned to me on July 27, 2023. The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits, including Items 1 through 7, are admitted in evidence without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all nine financial allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.i, without comment. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \nApplicant is a 52-year-old logistics technician working full time with a defense \ncontractor since February 2022. He worked with a different defense contractor from \nNovember 2018 through January 2022. He stated he was unemployed for about a month \nwhen that contract ended. \nFrom March 2015 through about October 2017, Applicant worked as a commercial \ndriver. He disclosed he was summarily dismissed from the position after he declined to \ntake on new stops which, he stated, would have increased his workload beyond his \nexisting 11\u201312-hour workday. He stated he was unemployed for about nine months prior \nto accepting a position in July 2018, where he worked as a lead housekeeper, until finding \na new position more related to his technical field in November 2018. (Items 3 and 6) \nDuring his periods of unemployment, Applicant stated he was supported by \nunemployment benefits and savings from his 401(k)-retirement plan. No additional \ninformation was provided concerning potential tax consequences created by his early \nwithdrawal of his 401(k)-retirement funds. (Items 3 and 6) \nApplicant was previously married from 1994 to about 2006. He has been married \nto his second wife since August 2007. He has three children ages 19, 16, and 14 years \nold. (Items 3 and 6) \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling about $47,900. Applicant admitted \nall debts alleged in the SOR. He described his overall financial situation as being able to \npay expenses with no money left over. (Item 6 at 11) He stated he and his wife have jobs \nand are trying to better themselves. In July 2022, the DOD investigator provided Applicant \nan opportunity to submit documentary evidence concerning his financial situation. \nHowever, Applicant declined stating he discussed the matter with his wife, and that they \ndetermined no extra funds were available to pay delinquent debts because of expected \nexpenses for school, children\u2019s birthdays, and holidays. He was afforded several \nopportunities to submit documentary evidence to support his case, but he never did. He \ndid not respond to the FORM; nor did he provide documents or materials in answering \nthe SOR. (See Item 6 pp. 11-12) \nThe evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($32,882): The oldest delinquent debt is a joint mortgage account \nopened in August 1999. The last payment on the account was made in May 2018. The \ndebt was charged off in about 2021. (Item 4 at 3; and Item 5 at 2) \nThis is a mortgage on a mobile home. Applicant stated he became delinquent on \nhis mortgage when he lost his job in October 2017. He stated he paid his $30,000 \nmortgage for about 22 years, but that the balance he owed was reduced by only $1,000 \nduring this entire period. He asserted his belief that his mortgage was not legal under \nstate law because it exceeded seven years. He presented no proof to support his \nassertion, nor did he explain further. Applicant stated he ultimately decided to abandon \nhis home because he was unable to pay. He did not notify or communicate with the \ncreditor when he abandoned the home in about 2021; nor has he communicated with the \ncreditor since that time. (Item 6 pp. 8-9). This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($8,857) and 1.c ($3,573): Applicant admitted both delinquent debts, \nstating he had credit cards with both creditors. He stated both debts were about $7,000 \neach, with monthly payments of about $300 per account. He disclosed he stopped making \npayments and communicating with creditors because he lacked income after losing his \njob. Both accounts are listed as individual accounts and both appear in his June and \nDecember 2022 credit bureau reports. (Items 4 and 5) SOR \u00b6 1.b was opened in April \n2016 and the last payment credited towards the account occurred in December 2017. \nThe account was charged off in about May 2022. (Item 4 at 5; and Item 5 at 2) SOR \u00b6 1.c \nwas assigned for collection in August 2018, and debt amount remained the same in his \nDecember credit bureau report. Both delinquent debts are unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g (altogether totaling $2,145): Applicant admitted all four \nconsumer debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g, without comment. He stated he believed the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d was a credit card account he used to purchase holiday gifts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.g were balances on mobile phone or wireless accounts for early termination \nfees or similar charges. Applicant did not communicate with the creditors regarding these \ndebts, as in other instances, because of his inability to pay. Applicant did not recall the \nreason for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f because he did not recognize the creditor. (Item 6 at 10) \nAll four delinquent debts are listed as individual accounts. Two accounts, SOR \u00b6 1.d and \n1.g, were opened in October 2018. SOR \u00b6 1.f was opened in July 2019, and SOR \u00b6 1.e, \nthe most recent debt, was opened in October 2021. All of these debts remain in a \ncollection status. (See Items 4 at 4; and Item 5 pp. 3-4) These debts are unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h ($216) and 1.i ($237): Applicant admitted delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h and 1.i, without commenting or providing clarifying information. During his July 2022 \ninterview with investigators, he stated he believed at least one medical debt related to a \n$2,000 bill he owed for treatment. He stated he paid about $100 per month for two years, \npursuant to an arrangement with the creditor, but that it is possible mail related to this \ndebt was not forwarded to him after he moved. He had no further information concerning \nthis debt.

Evidence for SOR \u00b6 1.h lists the original debt as $162 with \nan outstanding balance of $216, with activity and assignment dates listed as March 2021 \nand April 2021 respectively. (Item 5 at 4) Similarly, evidence for SOR \u00b6 1.i shows the \nsame underlying information in \u201c3rd party collection details.\u201d (Item 4 at 2) The original \ndebt was listed as $162, with a balance of $216.00. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i was reassigned \nto a new collection agency in September 2022. After reassignment, the collection balance \nincreased from $216 to $237. (Item 4 pp. 1-2) The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i \nare duplicate accounts. SOR \u00b6 1.i is therefore resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i allege duplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged \ntwice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nrecent and ongoing, and all except one remain unresolved. He did not provide \ndocumentary evidence to support his case. Though Applicant was unemployed from \nabout October 2017 to July 2018, he has not shown he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Additionally, he has been gainfully employed since that time. He made no \nattempt to communicate with creditors or otherwise address his delinquent debts. He did \nnot provide information or evidence about his income, or other financial resources at his \ndisposal during the time. Nor did he provide information or evidence he received or is \nreceiving financial counseling. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. There is evidence Applicant took steps to \naddress his delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h and is credited with substantially addressing it. \nHowever, none of the other debts in the SOR have been addressed. It is well settled that \nadverse information in credit bureau reports is sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s \nprima facie case that Applicant had delinquent debts that are of security concern. See \ngenerally ISCR Case No. 19-02993 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2021). Once established, it is the \nApplicant\u2019s burden to mitigate the security concern. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Applicant \nhas not met his burden here. \nOverall, there is insufficient evidence to determine that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable time. I am unable to find he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to repay his \ndebts.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate security concerns based on financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

On April 26, 2023, the case was forwarded to the DOHA \nhearing office for assignment to an administrative judge for a decision on the written \nrecord.

He denied the \nremaining debt (SOR \u00b6 1.m) and denied the falsification allegation under Guideline E \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a). His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. He is employed as a security officer. According to his \nSCA, he has worked for the employer sponsoring him for a clearance since June 2022. \nHe also reported working as a security officer for another employer since June 2018.

He served in the Marine Corps from 1986 to 1990 on active duty \nand then from 1990 to 1999 he served in the Marine Corps Reserve. He was discharged \nhonorably. He married in 1996, and he and his wife separated in July 2018. They remain \nseparated. He and his wife have two adult children in their 20s. (Item 2) \nThe record includes credit bureau reports (CBRs), from July 2022 and March 2023 \n(Items 4, 5), which establish the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. \nThe SOR debts total $60,334 in past-due debts, either charged off or reported for \ncollection. All but one of them appear to be consumer credit accounts. Applicant asserts \nin his SOR Answer that all of the charges were made by his spouse during a time when \nhe was not working. He said she was paying on the debts until they separated. He said \nhe was not aware of them until he spoke to the investigator (during his background \ninterview). Applicant provided no indication that any debts have been, or are being, paid, \nor that he has taken any steps to resolve or dispute them. \nAll of the debts are listed on Applicant\u2019s July 2022 credit report (Item 4) and most \nof them are listed on his March 2023 credit report as well.

(Item 4)The debts are detailed as follows:  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($18,527) is a credit account that has been charged off by a department \nstore. SOR \u00b6 1.b ($10,063) is an account that has been charged off by a bank. SOR \u00b6 1.c \n($6,255) is an account placed for collection by a bank. SOR \u00b6 1.d ($5,822) is an account \nthat has been charged off by a bank. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($5,036), 1.f ($4,352) and 1.g ($2,287) are accounts placed with the \nsame collection agency by three separate banks. SOR \u00b6 1.h ($2,286) is an account \nplaced for collection by a bank. It has the same account number and the same bank \ncreditor as the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.g, so I conclude it is the same debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,957) is an account placed for collection by a bank. SOR \u00b6 1.j ($1,879) \nis a credit account placed for collection by a department store. SOR \u00b6 1.k ($1,087) is an \naccount placed for collection by a credit card company. SOR \u00b6 1.l ($568) is an account \nplaced for collection by a bank. SOR \u00b6 1.m ($215), which Applicant denies without further \nexplanation, is a cable account placed for collection. \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts on his SCA. (Item 2 at 32-33). In \nhis September 2022 background interview, he confirmed his negative answers to all \nfinancial related questions on his SCA and did not acknowledge any delinquencies. He \nwas then confronted with evidence of his debts. He then said they were all credit cards \nor store credit card accounts that his wife opened. He said she would pay the accounts \nuntil they separated but then stopped making the payments out of spite. He thinks she \nopened more accounts after they separated. He asserted that he gets no information from \ncreditors, such as bills or notices. He said he did not list them on his SCA because he did \nnot have information about them at the time. He said he planned to address these \naccounts appropriately during divorce proceedings with his divorce attorney. He never \nused these cards but the balances are probably right. (Item 3) \nApplicant did not provide any documents with his answer to the SOR. There is no \nindication that he has made any effort to pay or resolve any of his SOR debts. He has \nnot indicated that he has participated in credit counseling or follows a budget. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant admitted all but one of the delinquent debts alleged, though he asserted \nthat they are his wife\u2019s responsibility. He and his wife are separated but he has given no \nindication that they are formally divorced. The SOR debts are all established by credit \nreports in the record. All of them are established as individual accounts, in his name. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 (a) and 19(c) apply. The exception is SOR \u00b6 1.h, which is listed as a debt with both the \noriginal creditor (\u00b6 1.h) and the collection agency (\u00b6 1.g). SOR \u00b6 1.h is therefore a \nduplicate.  \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that any mitigating \ncondition should apply. His assertion that his wife, from whom he is separated, is \nresponsible for all of the debts, is uncorroborated. He did not accept responsibility for any \nof them. He did not establish that he has taken any steps to address, pay, resolve, settle, \nor dispute any of the debts listed in the SOR. The debts are all ongoing, and none have \nbeen resolved. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose the 13 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m) listed on his July 2022 CBR when he \nsubmitted his SCA the same month. Applicant denies the allegation of falsification but \noffered no explanation for the omission. \nIn his background interview, Applicant did not acknowledge any debts until he was \nconfronted about them. He said his wife was responsible for all of the debts and stopped \npaying on them after they separated. All of the accounts are listed as individual accounts \non his credit report. Yet he asserted that he did not get any bills or notices about them \nand that he did not know anything about them when he submitted his SCA. I do not find \nthis assertion credible. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is established, notwithstanding \nApplicant\u2019s denial. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nFalsification of a security clearance application is a serious matter. It goes to the \nheart of an applicant\u2019s judgment, trustworthiness, and eligibility for a clearance. During \nhis interview, Applicant confirmed his negative responses to the financial questions on \nhis SCA and did not acknowledge any delinquencies until he was confronted about them. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce disqualifying conditions are established, Applicant has the burden to establish \nmitigation. He has not done so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his delinquent debts and \ndid not sufficiently or credibly explain why he did not list them on his SCA. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g, 1.i-1.m: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

In 2019, he . . . would occasionally go to the \ndispensary to use for anxiety and relaxation. He denied his THC use has \never crossed over into a problem and he has never had a problem with \nstopping the use of the drug. He denied any other type of illicit drug use. \n(AE P at 1)  \nIn his evaluation, Applicant \u201cdenied ever having a problem with alcohol or \nmarijuana. He has no plans to use the drug now or in the future. There is no \nrecommendation for treatment at this time.\u201d (AE P at 2) \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant minimized the extent of his marijuana use on his April \n9, 2022 SCA when he said that he used marijuana \u201c[a]pproximately 10 times total\u201d during \nthe previous seven years. (GE 1). SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges he said on his SCA that he did not \nintend to use marijuana in the future \u201cdue to paranoia and lack of feeling in control of \npersonal actions.\u201d (Id.) \nA May 17, 2022 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) summary of personal \nsubject interview (PSI), indicates Applicant told the investigator: \nSubject first smoked marijuana in or about Sep 2017. He smoked the drug \nwith friends. He did not smoke marijuana again until 2019. From 2019 to \nabout Oct 2021, Subject smoked marijuana 36 to 40 times, discrepant. He \nadvised that he listed 10 times on his security clearance paperwork because \nhe wanted to minimize the amount of his usage. Subject stated his decision \nto falsify his security clearance paperwork pertaining to his marijuana use \n[was] deliberate and willful.  \nFrom 2019 to Oct 2021, Subject would purchase his marijuana from \ndispensaries in [a state] where recreational usage is legal. Subject stated \nhe stopped smoking marijuana in or about Oct 2021 because he was \napplying for jobs and was concern[ed] he would not pass a drug test. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n    \nSubject was asked about his future intent regarding marijuana usage, and \nhe advised it is highly probable that he\u2019ll use marijuana in the future. Subject \nwas asked if he would smoke marijuana in the future knowing that it violates \nfederal law; he advised yes. However, he initially stated that he would not \nsmoke marijuana while holding a clearance. Shortly thereafter, he \ntransitioned his answer that there was a reasonable chance he would \nsmoke marijuana while holding a security clearance even if it violated policy \nand federal law.  \nSubject was asked what [other] federal law he feels he does not have to\ncomply with. He advised this is the only federal law he does not comply with.\nSubject was asked if it showed poor judgement that he violated and is willing\nto violate federal law; he advised yes that it does show poor judgement.\nSubject was asked if a person that exercises poor judgement should hold a\nsecurity clearance. He stated no. He was asked if he should be granted a\nsecurity clearance and he advised yes. He stated after further reflection, he\nhas decided not to use marijuana in the future as long as it violates federal\nlaw or violates security clearance rules. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubject denied any other illegal drug use. (GE 2) \nApplicant had an opportunity to submit corrections to the summary of the OPM \ninterview, and he failed to make corrections because of \u201ca lack of due diligence.\u201d (Tr. 37, \n52) At his hearing, he said he told the OPM investigator he used marijuana 36 to 40 times \nbased on use every two weeks over a 19-month period from 2020 to 2021. (Tr. 45-46) As \nto the number of his marijuana uses, he said \u201cI do not believe it\u2019s an inaccurate number, \nbut I am not sure of the exact number.\u201d (Tr. 48, 62-63) He estimated the true number of \nmarijuana uses to be in the mid-20s or more generally between 10 and 40 times. (Tr. 49, \n63) He acknowledged he may have underreported his marijuana use on his SCA, and he \nmay have given the OPM investigator an inaccurate number of marijuana uses due to \nbeing \u201cflustered\u201d and out of a desire to be cooperative and to agree with the investigator. \n(Tr. 50, 59) He denied that he deliberately underreported his marijuana uses on his SCA, \nand he insisted \u201c[a]t the time [he] filled it out [he] believed it was, approximately 10.\u201d (Tr. \n60-61) \nAs to his future intentions about marijuana use, Applicant told the OPM investigator\n\u201cto his knowledge\u201d he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 33-34) The \ninvestigator interpreted the words \u201cto his knowledge\u201d to be an equivocal denial of his \nintention not to use marijuana, and the investigator pressured Applicant on this issue. (Tr. \n33-35) Applicant attempted to convey to the OPM investigator that he did not intend to \nuse marijuana in the future; however, he \u201ctripped over [him]self and said, in kind of \nthinking [he] said no at the time, or the only other answer in this situation, is yes.\u201d (Tr. 57) \nHe was \u201ckind of scrambl[ing] to pick up the pieces in a sense.\u201d (Tr. 58) He was flustered \nand did not \u201cknow exactly why [he] said that\u201d there was a good chance he would use \nmarijuana in the future.

(Tr. 36, 38) \nCharacter Evidence \nThree coworkers, including his manager, and two friends from his university \npraised his good character and/or contributions to his employer. (Tr. 41-43; AE K-AE O) \nThe general sense of their statements and his academic records is that he is exceptionally \nintelligent, diligent, skilled, talented, dedicated, responsible, and professional employee. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; and \u201c(g) express intent to continue drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and \n25(g). \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c).

The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security .clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)). \nApplicant used marijuana 36 to 40 times. He knew his marijuana possession or \nuse or both was prohibited by federal law. His decision to repeatedly possess and use \nmarijuana is an indication he lacks the qualities expected of those with access to national \nsecrets. He told the OPM investigator that he intended to use marijuana in the future; \nhowever, he said he would not use marijuana while holding a security clearance or while \npossession or use of marijuana was prohibited by federal law. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed \nhis marijuana possession and use during the security clearance process. He disclosed \nhis marijuana use on his SCA, to an OPM investigator, in his SOR response, and during \nhis hearing. He provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, and he acknowledged that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he ended his marijuana use in October 2021, and he \ndid not intend to use marijuana use in the future. However, Applicant made inconsistent \nstatements about his future intentions concerning marijuana use and his number of \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarijuana uses.

I am uncertain \nabout his history and future marijuana use. Guideline H security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 describes the security concern about personal conduct as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes disqualifying one condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies and will be addressed in the mitigating section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns as follows: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nThe Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, \nstating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission.  \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant intended to use marijuana in the \nfuture. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant minimized the extent of his marijuana use on his April \n9, 2022 SCA when he said that he used marijuana \u201c[a]pproximately 10 times total\u201d during \nthe previous seven years. SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges he said on his SCA that he did not intend to \nuse marijuana in the future \u201cdue to paranoia and lack of feeling in control of personal \nactions.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant failed to honestly and candidly disclose negative information on his April \n9, 2022 SCA. He intentionally understated the extent of his marijuana use on his April 9, \n2022 SCA. He is exceptionally intelligent, and he was evasive at his hearing about the \nextent of his marijuana use during the seven years prior to completion of his SCA. I \nconclude the best estimate of his marijuana use was 36 to 40 times. He calculated the \nnumber of marijuana uses, and he was attempting to be honest with the OPM investigator. \nHe told the OPM investigator that he minimized or understated the number of occasions \nhe used marijuana on his SCA. \nApplicant denied at his hearing that he knowingly and intentionally fabricated his \nSCA with intent to deceive. I do not find his denials in this regard to be credible. His false \ndenials of his true state of mind when he completed his SCA show a lack of rehabilitation \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand weigh against mitigation of the personal conduct security concerns. None of the \nmitigating conditions fully apply. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 24 years old, and he is enrolled in a graduate program to enable him \nto earn a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. In 2021, he received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in computer engineering. He works for a defense contractor as a testing and \ndesign engineer. He received an award and a scholarship because of his academic \naccomplishments, and he maintained a high-level GPA. His resume provides additional \ndetails about his professional and technical experiences. Five-character witnesses \npraised Applicant\u2019s good character and/or contributions to his employer. The general \nsense of their statements and his academic records is that he is an exceptionally \nintelligent, diligent, skilled, talented, dedicated, responsible, and professional employee. \nThe character evidence provides important support for his access to classified \ninformation. \nApplicant discussed his history of involvement with marijuana on his SCA, during \nhis OPM personal subject interview, in his SOR response, and at his hearing. He did not \ntest positive on a urinalysis test, and he does not have any drug-related arrests. He \npromised not to use marijuana in the future. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive at this time. \nApplicant said he used marijuana about 10 times in the previous seven years on his April \n9, 2022 SCA. He told an OPM investigator that he used marijuana 36 to 40 times in the \nprevious seven years, and he admitted to the OPM investigator that he intentionally \nunderstated the number of times he used marijuana on his SCA. In response to DOHA \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \ninterrogatories, he certified the accuracy of his OPM interview. At his hearing, he claimed \nthat the information about using marijuana 10 times on his SCA was not a deliberate \nfalsification or made with intent to deceive. He said he honestly believed he only used \nmarijuana 10 times when he was completing his SCA. I find that he deliberately \nunderstated or minimized the number of occasions he used marijuana on his SCA. He \nwas not a credible witness at his hearing. \nAn honest and candid self-report of marijuana use is an important indication that, \nif granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to \nnational security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her \nown career or personal reputation. However, to receive full credit, the self-report must be \ncandid and honest. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

Applicant \ntestified that he cooperated with the police, and the police took no action. (Tr. at 17-18.) \nThe Complainant submitted her charges to the police the day she moved out of \nApplicant\u2019s house. The police prepared an extensive report (GE 3). The report states that \nshe felt \u201cvery uncomfortable around [Applicant].\u201d Her first complaint was that Applicant \nstared at her body in a sexual manner. She reported that on a trip to an amusement park \nwith Applicant, his son, and a friend of the son, Applicant made inappropriate comments \nto her about her body. Also, she went on a water ride wearing a white jumpsuit and got \nwet, which made her outfit transparent revealing her body and undergarments. She \nclaimed Applicant tried to take a picture of her in that condition. She also complained that \nwhile swimming at the amusement park, he would swim underwater and grab her legs \nand stomach. (GE 3 at 1.) \nThe police report contains numerous other complaints about Applicant\u2019s actions \ndirected at the Complainant. She reported that he often would enter her bedroom \nunannounced. He would lie on her floor, or on occasion, he would lie down next to her on \nher bed to talk. He also tickled her almost daily. She also claimed that he once grabbed \nher buttocks. On one occasion, she walked out of her bathroom and observed Applicant \nstanding naked in front of his bedroom door. She complained that Applicant would \nfrequently tap her on the buttocks with his hand or foot. She commented to the police that \nApplicant is very friendly, but she was scared that \u201che will take it to the next level.\u201d She \nreported to the police that Applicant\u2019s wife was \u201cvery distant\u201d and did not interact with her \nat all. She felt so uncomfortable with Applicant\u2019s behavior that she called her parents, and \nthey arranged for her to be removed from Applicant\u2019s home and relocated to another host. \nShe lived at Applicant\u2019s home from August 10, 2010, to September 17, 2010. The SOR \nincorrectly alleged that Applicant\u2019s sexual misconduct occurred in 2011. The \nComplainant\u2019s parents refused to permit their daughter to participate in a \u201cpretext call\u201d \nproposed by the police to try to have Applicant say something incriminating to confirm her \nallegations. They advised the police that their daughter was happy with her new host, and \nthey did not want her to be further involved with Applicant out of concern it would upset \nher more. The police report concludes that the case was referred to the District Attorney\u2019s \noffice for their review for possible criminal charges against Applicant for annoying or \nmolesting a child. (GE 3 at 3-4, 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, 16.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied all of the most serious allegations made by the \nComplainant. He admitted, however, he did grab her leg while swimming under water at \nthe amusement park, just as he did with his son and the son\u2019s friend. He also admitted \nthat on one occasion he sat of the end of her bed and another time laid down on the floor \nto talk with her. On another occasion, he claimed that while he was in her room, she \ninvited him to lie on top of the covers of her bed while they talked. On cross-examination, \nhe admitted that this occurred at least twice, but he said she was under the bed covers. \nHe acknowledged that he made a mistake by retrieving a towel from a hallway closet \nwhile he was unclothed after a shower. He later learned that she saw him from the rear. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \nHe thought he was being discreet and was careful to avoid being seen. He also admitted \nthat he hugged her as well others in his family and one time when she was sick, he gave \nher medicine and kissed her on the forehead. He also wrestled with her standing up as \nhe did while playing with his son. Applicant testified that he thought he had a good \nrelationship with her and was surprised when she made her complaints to the police. He \nbelieves she misinterpreted certain events when she lived in his home, and he asserted \nthat he never touched her in an inappropriate way. He also claimed that the Complainant \nwas removed from other host homes due to causing problems during her nine-month \nexchange student status in the United States. He also falsely stated that after he spoke \nto the police, the police determined that the Complaint\u2019s claims had no merit and \ndismissed the matter. On cross-examination, he acknowledged that he was never told by \nthe police that the Complainant\u2019s charges had no merit. He also noted that his family \nhosted seven exchange students over seven years, two of which were females, the \nComplainant and an exchange student with whom he had an extramarital affair in 2008 \nafter her exchange year had ended and she had turned 18 years old. (SOR \u00b6 1.b, below) \n(Tr. at 18, 20, 22-24, 30-34, 39-40.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. The Government alleged in this subparagraph that in 2008 Applicant \nhad an 18-month extramarital affair with an 18-year-old German woman (the German \nStudent), who had been hosted by Applicant as a foreign exchange student in 2006-2007. \nShe was 16 or 17 years old at that time. Applicant acknowledged that he treated this \nstudent with similar physical behaviors of touching and hugging during her school year \nliving at Applicant\u2019s home. Applicant admitted this allegation in the Answer but noted that \nthe affair occurred 15 years ago and was not criminal in nature, presumably because of \nher age at that time. At the hearing, Applicant argued that the affair was private, \nconsensual, and discreet. She was 18 years old, and he was 42. He acknowledged that \nthe affair was wrong and asserted he has not done anything similar since then. He \nexplained that they had remained in contact after her exchange student school year. In \n2008 the German Student returned to visit Applicant, and she initiated an affair with him. \nShe only stayed in the United States for four weeks, but they continued the relationship \nthrough electronic communications until 2010. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 26-28, 34-36; GE 2 at \n7.) \nApplicant testified that he ended the relationship with the German Student after six \nmonths because he felt what he was doing was wrong. He claimed that he told his wife \nsome years later about it in the spirit of being honest with his wife. His disclosure of the \naffair occurred sometime after the Complainant\u2019s allegations (SOR \u00b6 1.a). In his \nresponses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant noted that the disclosure of the affair to \nhis wife was in about 2014. He last communicated with the German Student in February \n2021. She also sent him birthday greetings in July 2022 or 2023.

They also remarked about his sound judgment. His \nchurch minster commented that Applicant has a strong marriage and is a man of faith. \nTwo close friends wrote about Applicant\u2019s integrity and sound values. (AE A through F.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline D \u2013 Sexual Behavior) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Two conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s conduct with a 17-year-old foreign exchange \nstudent, who was entrusted in his care as a host, was substantial, credible evidence of \nbehavior of a sexual nature so as to render the term \u201csexual behavior\u201d in AG \u00b6 13(c) and \n13(d) applicable. The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior \nwith both the Complainant and the German Student causes him to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior with the \nComplainant and the German Student also reflects a serious lack of judgment. His \nbehavior establishes both AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(c) and 13(d) as does the overall pattern of Applicant\u2019s \nsexual behavior with the two young females. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the burden of persuasion shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his actions. The following three mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 \nare possibly applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior established by \nthe record evidence happened a number of years ago. However, the overall pattern of his \nbehavior makes it difficult to conclude that other misconduct of a sexual nature with young \nfemales would be unlikely to recur. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nAG \u00b6 14(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s denial of any misconduct with the \nComplainant is not credible in light of the very unusual conduct he acknowledges. His \nbehavior is even more concerning because he only knew her for a brief period when his \ntroubling interactions began. Applicant provided no corroborating evidence from his wife \nto indicate that she knows the full extent of his misconduct with the Complainant or \nApplicant\u2019s 18-month affair with the German Student and his more recent contacts with \nher. Based on the record evidence, the Complainant, her parents, and the German \nStudent are potentially in positions to assert coercion and duress against Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 14(d) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s conduct of a sexual nature with \nthe Complainant was not consensual because she was a minor at the time. Also, some \nof the behavior she complained about occurred in front of Applicant\u2019s son and was \ntherefore public and not discreet. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s sexual affair with the \nGerman student was private, consensual, and discreet. \nThe quality of Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence did not fully address the seriousness \nof the security concerns raised by the record evidence under Guideline D. Overall, \nApplicant failed to carry his burden to establish mitigation under this guideline. \nParagraph 2 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 sets forth the following condition that could raise security concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is established. Applicant\u2019s conduct could affect his personal, \nprofessional, and community standing if known. This renders him vulnerable to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress by others, including a foreign intelligence entity. \nThe evidence also supports a conclusion under AG \u00b6 15 that Applicant\u2019s conduct involves \nquestionable judgment that raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. He was entrusted with the wellbeing \nof two young girls far from their homes and parents, and he abused his fiduciary \nresponsibility to them. Security concerns under \u00b6 15 have been established. \nAccordingly, the burden of persuasion shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his actions. The guideline includes the following two conditions in AG \n\u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s misconduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s offenses are not minor, though they happened many years ago. As \nnoted above, the repeated nature of the misconduct (or at least poor judgment) does not \npermit a conclusion that additional similar misconduct with young girls or young women \nis unlikely to recur. Moreover, his offenses cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand good judgment. Applicant failed to carry his burden to establish mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant has also not established mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(d) because he has \nnot fully acknowledged his misconduct and poor judgment and has not obtained \ncounseling. Although he is no longer hosting foreign exchange students, there is always \nthe risk that he might engage in future similar misconduct with other teenagers. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the whole-person \nfactors quoted above. I have weighed the fact that Applicant\u2019s behavior occurred a \nnumber of years ago. I have also given significant weight to what I conclude was predatory \nbehavior directed at two young females by Applicant, a much older man in a position of \npower, authority, and fiduciary responsibility. Applicant sumitted noteworthy character \nevidence, but overall, he has not provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his conduct with the Complainant and the German Student. Applicant \nhas expressed little or no regret for his actions, and I cannot conclude that such behavior \ndirected at young women or teenage girls will not recur. Overall, the record evidence \nraises questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and \na security clearance. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a). In her Answer \nApplicant denied this allegation and provided an explanation of the circumstances of the \ndrug test. \nI make the following findings of fact with respect SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a: \nApplicant was drug tested on July 27, 2020, in connection with her ANG service. \nThe test results were reported by the lab on August 5, 2020, as positive for THC, or \nmarijuana. On August 18, 2020, a flag was initiated by the Deputy Chief of Staff G-1 of \nState 1\u2019s ANG.

The memorandum further reflects that she \u201csuccessfully attended and \nparticipated in the required inpatient program.\u201d A May 8, 2023 memorandum from the \nState 1 ANG Joint Force Headquarters recites the details of Applicant\u2019s positive drug test, \nincluding her being. \u201cFlagged for drug abuse.\u201d and her successful completion of the \nsubstance abuse inpatient program, as set forth in GE 7. Applicant\u2019s positive test result \nfor THC is substantial evidence of her use of marijuana prior to the test. (GE 4 through \nGE 8.) \nOn August 18, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by a U.S. Government investigator \nin connection with her 2021 security clearance application (GE 1). The investigator \nprepared a summary of Applicant\u2019s statements during the interview in a report (ROI). \nApplicant confirmed the accuracy of the report in her responses to DOHA\u2019s \ninterrogatories. The ROI recites that Applicant denied in her interview that she had used \nmarijuana prior to testing positive for THC in July 2020. She claimed that she was first \nadvised about three months by her commander after the drug test that she tested positive \nand had to retest the next day. Applicant declined to retest because she said she had a \nfamily emergency and was unavailable the next day. She further asserted in the interview \nthat this conversation about three weeks prior to her separation from the ANG, which was \nin October 2020. (GE 3 at 4.) \nApplicant\u2019s interview statements are inconsistent with the Government\u2019s \ndocumentary evidence described above that she was advised in August 2020 that she \nwas flagged for drug abuse and that she was required to participate in an inpatient \nsubstance abuse treatment program beginning on August 27, 2020, which she \nsubsequently completed. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she first learned about the positive drug test \nwhen her sergeant advised her of the test results just prior to her separation from the \nANG. She denied that she had used marijuana prior to her drug test or at any other time \nsince 2010. She testified that her sergeant told her to speak with their unit commander \non October 18, 2020, for further instructions. She advised the commander that the test \nresults were inaccurate due to a label mix up. She explained to the commander that new \nlabels had to be printed during the testing process and that a mix up produced an \nerroneous positive test result for Applicant. She also claimed at the hearing that neither \nshe nor anyone else taking a drug test at that time were asked to re-sign the new labels. \nApplicant made the additional assertions that the October 2020 Memorandum contained \ninaccurate information in that she never participated in the ANG\u2019s SAP. (Tr. at 13-14, 24-\n26, 29-30.) \nApplicant further testified that her commander told her that she could file a \ncomplaint with the Inspector General (IG) and that she would receive paper copies of all \nof the relevant documentation.

She did not produce a copy of her IG complaint at the hearing. \nShe claimed that she followed up on her complaint several times, but she never heard \nfurther and did not receive paper copies of anything related to the drug test. Applicant \nalso testified that prior to receiving the Government\u2019s evidence from Department Counsel \nin March 2023, she had never seen GE 6, the August 2020 DA 286. (Tr. at 14-15, 22, 25-\n27.) \nParagraph 2: Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR sets forth three allegations under the Personal Conduct guideline. The \nGovernment alleged that Applicant has engaged in dishonest and unreliable conduct by \nfalsifying responses to questions in her 2021 e-QIP and her 2014 e-QIP regarding her \npast use of illegal drugs. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b.) The SOR also cross-alleged the allegation \nset forth in \u00b6 1.a under Guideline H. (SOR \u00b6 2.c.) \nI make the following findings of fact with respect SOR allegation \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through \n2.c: \nDepartment Counsel submitted the 2021 e-QIP (GE 1) and an excerpt for the 2014 \ne-QIP (GE 2). In the 2021 e-QIP, Applicant responded in the negative to the question in \nSection 23 of that application about her drug use in the past seven years. The excerpt \nfrom Applicant\u2019s 2014 e-QIP are the pages of that application in which Section 23 \nappears. The SOR points to Applicant\u2019s failed drug test in July 2020 as evidence that she \nhad used marijuana prior to the drug test and that her response to the seven-year drug \nquestion in Section 23 of the 2021 e-QIP was a deliberate falsification. In view of my \nfinding above that her positive drug test was substantial evidence of Applicant having \nused marijuana prior to the test, I conclude that the Government has met its burden to \nestablish its allegation that Applicant deliberately falsified her answers in Section 23 of \nthe 2019 e-QIP. (GE 1 at 31-32.) \nAs stated, Department Counsel also submitted an excerpt of Applicant\u2019s 2014 e-\nQIP with her responses to Section 23 regarding drug use in the past seven years. \nApplicant answered these questions in the negative. During her 2022 background \ninterview, she disclosed that she had use marijuana once in 2010 when she was a \nfreshman in high school. She also wrote in the Answer that she had smoked marijuana in \nAugust 2010, which was the same high school incident. She blamed the non-disclosure \nof that drug use in the 2014 e-QIP on her recruiter, who she claimed filled out the form \nfor her. She asserted in her Answer and at the hearing that she had advised the recruiter \nabout her one-time prior use of marijuana, and he failed to note her response in the 2014 \ne-QIP. (Answer; Tr. at 18; GE 2 at 20-21; GE 3 at 5.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained the non-disclosure of her drug use in 2010. \nShe testified that she advised her recruiter of her drug use in high school, and he told her \nnot to mention it or she would not be allowed to enlist. She reported that the recruiter told \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher everything would be \u201cfine\u201d if she passed the drug test when she enlisted. She claimed \nthat the recruiter prepared her 2014 e-QIP. She did admit that she signed the 2014 e-QIP \nunder penalty of perjury for any deliberately false statements. (Tr. at 18-20.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nAG \u00b6 25 sets forth the following condition that could raise security concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAs noted, the Government\u2019s evidence of Applicant\u2019s drug use is substantial \nevidence that she in fact used marijuana and establishes the disputed allegation in SOR \n1.a and the potentially disqualifying condition set forth in AG \u00b6 25(a). Applicant\u2019s denial \nof this allegation based upon a claim that her test sample was mislabeled is not credible \nand does not refute the documentary evidence in the record. Applicant\u2019s similar claim that \nshe did not receive a copy of the August 2020 DA 286 in 2020 and her denial of the facts \nset forth in the October 2020 Memorandum regarding her participation and completion of \nthe ANG inpatient SAP before she acknowledged receiving the August 2020 test results \nis also not credible. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s credible documentary evidence shifts \nthe burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by her conduct.  \nAG \u00b6 26 contains the following two conditions that could mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by Applicant drug use: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana and issued the Guidance to \u201cprovide \nclarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed the previous SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding \nthe importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nIn light of Applicant\u2019s denial of using marijuana notwithstanding the positive test \nresults for THC, neither of the above mitigating condition are applicable. Her behavior \ncast doubts on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The threshold \nrequirement for the application of AG \u00b6 26(b) is that Applicant acknowledge her drug \ninvolvement. She has not done so. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists the following two conditions that could raise security concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant deliberately omitted two instances \nof drug use from her e-QIPs, first her 2010 marijuana use in her 2014 e-QIP and then her \n2020 drug use in her 2021 e-QIP. As noted above, the record evidence of Applicant\u2019s \npositive drug test for THC established that she used marijuana in 2020. Applicant admits \nthat she used marijuana in 2010. This evidence shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by her omissions and her 2020 drug use. \nThe guideline includes the following three conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s falsifications on the e-QIPs and her positive \ndrug test: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, of falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirements to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been established. Applicant did not \nmake a prompt good-faith effort to correct her omissions. In fact, she denied omitting \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nanything in her 2021 e-QIP as recently as the hearing in this case. Her admission in her \n2022 background interview of her omission of her 2010 drug use was hardly prompt. \nMoreover, her admission was not in good faith since she denied making the decision to \nomit the information on her own, claiming that the recruiter filled out the 2014 e-QIP and \nprovided a false negative answer to the past seven-years question about illegal drug use \nin Section 23. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that she was instructed by her recruiter to omit the \ninformation about her 2010 drug use lacked credibility, as did much of her testimony about \nother important facts. Throughout the hearing, Applicant showed a reluctance to accept \nany responsibility for her actions and found excuse after excuse to deny her responsibility. \nHer claim about her recruiter\u2019s instructions is a significant example of this pattern of \nbehavior. Other examples are her claim that the drug test administrator in 2020 \nmislabeled her test sample; that she never received the August 2020 DA 268 in 2020; \nthat she was not advised about the August 2020 positive drug test results until October \n2020, just prior to her discharge; and that the October 2020 Memorandum contained false \ninformation about her participation and completion of the ANG mandatory inpatient SAP \nstarting in August 2020 following her positive test for THC. Her unwillingness to be candid \nduring her background investigation, in the Answer, and at the hearing casts doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the above whole-person factors and the potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, as well as the SecEA\u2019s Guidance, in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated her drug use in July \n2020 and positive drug test results. She also has not mitigated her falsifications in two \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance applications. Her testimony lacked credibility on the key issues in this \ncase and she presented no documentation to support her version of the facts. I cannot \nconclude that Applicant will be any more candid in the future if her behavior is ever \nscrutinized for propriety. Overall, the record evidence raises questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted she used marijuana on one occasion in about the spring of 2020, SOR \u00b6 1.a, and she denied both allegations of falsification of her 2022 SCA, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, in her Answer to the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 32 years old. She has been married to her husband since June 2017. She does not have any children. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in December 2013. In August 2016, she received a certificate in information accessibility and design policy. She was previously employed by a government contractor from June 2017 to February 2021 as a web developer. She has possessed a secret security clearance since 2018.

The hearing was held as \nscheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nand 2, and a Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1; I admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified, and a witness testified on her behalf. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 20, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted she used marijuana on one occasion in about the spring of \n2020, SOR \u00b6 1.a, and she denied both allegations of falsification of her 2022 SCA, SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, in her Answer to the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 32 years old. She has been married to her husband since June \n2017. She does not have any children. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer \nscience in December 2013. In August 2016, she received a certificate in information \naccessibility and design policy. She was previously employed by a government \ncontractor from June 2017 to February 2021 as a web developer. She has possessed a \nsecret security clearance since 2018. In February 2021, she was hired by her current \nemployer, also a government contractor, that sold the contract to another federal \ncontractor in September 2022. She discovered that she needed a top secret security \nclearance for her current position as software engineer, and she completed an SCA on \nJuly 29, 2022. (Tr. 14-17, 31; GE 1, GE 2) \nDrug Involvement and Falsification \nIn her July 2022 SCA, Applicant stated that she inadvertently failed to disclose, \nas required, that she had used marijuana on one occasion in about the spring of 2020, \nwhich was during the time she possessed a secret DOD security clearance. She \ntestified at the hearing that when she completed the SCA online in July 2022, it took her \nabout a week to update all of the detailed information. After it was completed, she \nsubmitted the SCA and then she printed it out. Although she had admitted she had \nthoroughly reviewed the form online for accuracy and completeness, it was not until \nafter she had printed out the SCA that she realized that she had gotten an address \nwrong, and she had incorrectly answered two of the illegal drug questions. She did not \ndisclose her one-time use of marijuana in 2020 while possessing a DOD security \nclearance because it had completely slipped her mind. (Tr. 15-20, 28; GE 1, GE 2) \nWhen her attorney asked her how her one-time use of marijuana could have been \nmomentarily forgotten, Applicant stated: \nWell, it\u2019s like if -- if anyone asks me, I\u2019m not in -- I\u2019m not in the kind of \nsocial circles to -- around people that do that kind of thing all the time. So \nif anyone asked if I smoke or whatever, no, I don\u2019t. That\u2019s not for me. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThat\u2019s not something I have -- I do or have done. I mean, I have to \nreconcile that in my mind of, yes, I did do that once, and that was a \nmistake and not something I plan to repeat. (Tr. 20) \nWhen Applicant realized she had incorrectly answered the drug questions, she \nimmediately called her best friend and asked her what she should do about it. After \nsome discussion, Applicant decided she would correct her mistake when she \nparticipated in her background subject interview with an authorized DOD investigator on \nSeptember 20, 2022. Applicant started off the interview by providing clarification about \nher physical location/updated address. She did not disclose her omitted drug \ninformation until the investigator questioned her about illegal drug use. After the enquiry \nfrom the investigator, Applicant admitted she had used marijuana once during the spring \nof 2020 when she shared a joint with her husband, and she took \u201cabout two puffs.\u201d She \nstated that her spouse regularly uses marijuana, and he had applied for a medical \nmarijuana card. She told the investigator that he uses marijuana on a weekly basis, but \nhe had expressed interest in stopping marijuana use because he wanted to obtain a \nU.S. Coast Guard\u2019s captain\u2019s license. She admitted that she had also drank a couple of \nalcoholic drinks at the time she tried the marijuana. She was not certain if she held a \nsecret security clearance at the time, and she did not report her drug use to her \nemployer because she was not aware that she was required to do so. She clarified to \nthe investigator that she had overlooked the drug questions because the SCA online \nhad previously populated the answers from her previous SCA, and she had only briefly \nlooked over the 2022 SCA before submitting it. (Tr. 21-25; GE 2) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted that her state of residence had legalized \nthe recreational use of marijuana in 2020. At the age of 29, she had taken one puff of \nmarijuana in approximately the spring of 2020 with her spouse and regretted her \ndecision immediately. She had never used marijuana, or any other illegal drug, before \nor after that incident. She also denied telling the investigator during her background \ninterview that she was not certain she possessed a security clearance during the time \nshe had used marijuana. (Tr. 24-25, 32) \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant stated that when she applied for the top \nsecret security clearance by submitting the July 2022 SCA, she discovered from her \nemployer that she was to undergo a polygraph examination. She was fully aware that \nmarijuana was illegal under federal law and incompatible with individuals who \npossessed DOD security clearances. Even though she had never tried marijuana \nbefore, she was asked to explain why, at the age of 29 and while possessing a DOD \nsecurity clearance, she decided to try marijuana for the first time. Applicant admitted \nthat it was a \u201cminor lapse in judgment\u201d and that she had consumed two alcoholic \nbeverages beforehand. She also stated that even though she spent an extensive \namount of time completing the SCA, when she read over the drug questions, her one-\ntime use of marijuana did not come to mind. She did not immediately report her \nomissions to the facility security officer (FSO), because at the time, she was not even \naware of an FSO. She admitted that her program supervisor had emailed her about the \nnecessity of completing a new SCA, but she did not report her SCA omissions to her \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprogram manager either. She denied that she was aware that she was supposed to \nreport any illegal drug use to her employer while possessing a security clearance, but \nshe readily admitted that she had received annual security briefings and was certain this \ntopic was discussed during those briefings. (Tr. 31-44) \nI questioned Applicant about some inconsistent statements she had made to the \nbackground investigator and during the hearing. She had told the investigator during her \nSeptember 2022 interview that she had overlooked the drug questions on the 2022 SCA \nbecause the online application had automatically populated previous answers she had \nreported on an earlier SCA she had submitted. She had also told the investigator that \nshe had only briefly reviewed the July 2022 SCA before she submitted it. Her testimony \nwas that she had taken a week to prepare her 2022 SCA and she had specifically \nanswered the drug questions with a negative response because she did not recall, at \nthat time, that she had used marijuana in 2020 or while possessing a security \nclearance. Applicant admitted she had told the investigator that information but also \nacknowledged that the drug questions on her 2022 SCA did not automatically populate \n\u2013 she had to specifically answer the illegal drug questions. (Tr. 42-47) \nApplicant testified that her husband did not get a medical marijuana card, but he \nhad obtained marijuana for recreational use legally in 2020. She said he had used \nmarijuana on a weekly basis until \u201ca couple of months ago\u201d because he recently \ndecided to apply for a captain\u2019s license. After Applicant admitted that her husband \nstopped his regular use of marijuana in June or July 2023, Department Counsel \nquestioned her why she failed to indicate her husband\u2019s regular use of marijuana on the \nFebruary 2023 interrogatory question \u2013 \u201c8. Do you associate with individuals who use \nmarijuana, any product containing THC, or any illegal drug(s)?\u201d Applicant had answered \nthis question \u201cNo.\u201d Applicant then testified that she was not certain of the dates of her \nhusband\u2019s marijuana use, but that in September 2022, at the time of her background \ninterview, he was using marijuana weekly, by February 2023, the time she completed \nthe interrogatories, he had quit, and then sometime afterwards he resumed using \nmarijuana until June or July 2023, when he quit again. She said the longest time he has \nrefrained from using marijuana was six months. Applicant provided a signed statement \nof intent to abstain from all illegal drug involvement and substance misuse when she \nsubmitted her interrogatory response in February 2023. (Tr. 47-59; GE 2) \nApplicant stated that she had told her best friend that she had used marijuana on \none occasion in 2020. Her best friend testified that she met Applicant on a camping trip \nin September 2021. Since that time, they have become best friends and talk to each \nother every day. She recalled Applicant had called her in a panic when she received the \nemail that she was to have a background interview with an investigator, and after \nreviewing the July 2022 SCA, she realized that she had not listed her one-time illegal \ndrug use on the application because she had thought it had occurred outside the \nquestion\u2019s scope of time. The witness was interviewed during Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance investigation and had reported to the investigator that Applicant had used \nmarijuana once in college.

(Tr. 25, 61-72, 77-\n80) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d;, \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, . . . .\u201d; and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and 25(c). \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant did provide a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug involvement and substance misuse. \nThis signed statement of intent does not hold much value after considering Applicant\u2019s \ninconsistent statements. She had claimed initially during her background interview that \nthe 2022 SCA was populated with information from her previous submission of an SCA, \nand that was the reason why she did not respond correctly to the drug questions. She \ntold the investigator that she briefly reviewed the SCA before submitting it. During the \nhearing she testified that she had taken a full week to update her 2022 SCA, and that \nshe had carefully reviewed the application for accuracy and completeness. She \nspecifically omitted her one-time use of marijuana during the spring of 2020 and while \npossessing a security clearance because it had not crossed her mind. Her best friend \ntestified that Applicant had told her she did not disclose her one-time use of marijuana \nbecause she had thought it had occurred outside the scope of the SCA question. These \ninconsistent statements support a finding that Applicant is not a credible witness. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana casts doubts on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations, and suitability to hold a clearance, especially because her marijuana use \noccurred when she was a mature adult and possessed a security clearance. She was \naware of the federal government\u2019s policy against illegal drug use, and the adverse \nsecurity consequences for such use. Nevertheless, she made the poor decision to try \nmarijuana with her husband, who may or may not be a regular user of marijuana. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant deliberately falsified her July 2022 SCA by intentionally failing to \ndisclose her 2020 use of marijuana while holding a DOD security clearance. Although \nnot alleged in the SOR, during her September 2022 background interview, Applicant \ndisclosed her one-time use of marijuana during the spring of 2020, but she has provided \ninconsistent information about why she failed to disclose this information on her 2022 \nSCA. The record evidence shows that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant denied that she falsified her \n2022 SCA because (1) the drug information was prepopulated on the 2022 SCA and \nshe briefly reviewed the SCA before submitting it; (2) she specifically answered the drug \nquestions \u201cNo\u201d because she did not recall that she had used marijuana one time in \n2020, or that she used it while possessing a secret security clearance; or (3) she did not \ndisclose her 2020 use of marijuana while possessing a security clearance because she \nthought her use occurred outside the scope of the drug question. Applicant\u2019s \ninconsistent statements demonstrate that she was less than candid when she submitted \nher 2022 SCA responses, and that she deliberately misled or made false statements to \nthe government investigator, to her best friend, or during her hearing about why she \nfailed to disclose her 2020 marijuana use while possessing a security clearance on the \nSCA. \nAlso, Applicant\u2019s failure to immediately report her omissions to her FSO or \nprogram manager and deciding to wait until she was interviewed by a DOD authorized \ninvestigator does not demonstrate a prompt, good-faith effort to correct her previous \nomissions. Applicant has established a pattern of dishonesty, which casts doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. The personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance places a heavy \nburden on her to establish mitigation. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable \nclearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for doubt about an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nAfter considering the record as a whole, and the circumstances surrounding \nApplicant\u2019s one-time use of marijuana, I conclude that she has not met her heavy \nburden of proof and persuasion due to her testimony and other record statements \nreplete with inconsistencies. She is not a credible, reliable, or trustworthy source. She \nwas fully aware of the federal government\u2019s policy against illegal drug use, and the \nadverse security consequences for such use. Despite being a mature adult possessing \na secret security clearance, she made the poor decision to use marijuana with her \nhusband in 2020. Her pattern of dishonesty continues to cast doubt on her reliability and \ntrustworthiness. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline H and Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

He \nsought to clarify previous statements he made, emphasizing that he would use marijuana \nin the future \u201cif legal,\u201d stating he had no current plans to use marijuana in the immediate \nfuture. (Item 2) Applicant previously disclosed his intention to use marijuana in the future \nin his February 2022 SCA, and his March 2022 interview with a DOD investigator. (Items \n4 and 9) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guidelines note several conditional that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nApplicant used marijuana on multiple occasions from August 2012 through July \n2021. He most recently disclosed he smoked marijuana during this period in his 2022 \nSCA and 2022 DOD interview. In these documents, he also expressed his intention to \ncontinue using marijuana in this future; or at a minimum, he failed to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinuing using marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(g) are \napplicable. \nIn his January 2023 response to the SOR, Applicant, for the first time, asserted he \nused Delta-8 THC products \u201cbeginning during the pandemic lockdown and periodically \nafterwards in social settings . . . .\u201d Delta-8 THC products are not considered federally \nillegal under the Controlled Substances Act if it is determined to contain less than 0.3% \ndelta-9 THC. Applicant\u2019s assertion he used federally legal Delta-8 THC products, instead \nof standard marijuana products, is not believable. He presented no documentary proof \nto support his claim. He repeatedly stated in his 2018 and 2022 interviews with DOD \ninvestigators, that his friends provided marijuana \u201cbongs\u201d or cigars they smoked together \nsocially; and that he never purchased marijuana. Had he used Delta-8 THC, he would \nhave stated so, at a minimum, in his 2022 SCA and during his 2022 interview with a DOD \ninvestigator. \nEven assuming Applicant used Delta-8 THC products, there is a lack of clarity \nconcerning the claimed period of use, and periods when he admitted use, but did not \nclaim to have used Delta-8 THC products instead. For example, for SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant \nadmitted he used marijuana from August 2012 to July 2021, but qualified his admission, \nstating \u201c. . . usage after roughly 2014 (beginning around the middle of 2020) would be \nlimited to the federally legal Delta-8 THC.\u201d It is unclear if he claimed to have used Delta-\n8 THC products starting in 2014 or mid-2020. \nThere is a similar lack of clarity concerning Applicant\u2019s claimed period of use \ncreated by comments in his April 2023 response to the FORM. He stated he \u201cdoes not \nplan to use marijuana illegally again since ceasing usage (in) prior to graduating college \nin 2017;\u201d and that he had not used Delta-8 THC products \u201csince July 2021 when he \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlearned that this was a substance prohibited under DOD Guidelines,\u201d stating he only used \nDelta-8 THC products \u201ca few times \u2013 maybe twice per month at most \u2013 from the summer \nof 2020 through July 2021.\u201d \nBased on the above, it is unclear whether Applicant\u2019s claimed period of Delta-8 \nTHC use is from summer 2020 through July 2021. If so, he still admittedly used standard \nmarijuana from August 2012 to about mid-2020, after stating in his February 2017 SCA \nand May 2018 interview, that he stopped using marijuana in December 2016, because \nhe desired to find a good job and to have a good career. He also stated he would refrain \nfrom using marijuana in the future. \nUnlike the above, AG \u00b6 25(f) is not applicable. Neither SOR \u00b6 1.b nor SOR \u00b6 1.c \nallege distinctive disqualifying conditions that address the conduct described in AG \u00b6 \n25(f). Specifically, SOR \u00b6 1.b. alleges disqualifying conduct already included within the \nscope of AG \u00b6 25(a), namely, conduct already alleged for SOR \u00b6 1.a. Likewise, language \nused for SOR \u00b6 1.c does not allege Applicant used marijuana \u201cwhile granted access to \nclassified information,\u201d as required, to address disqualifying conduct under AG \u00b6 25(f). \nInstead, it alleges Applicant used marijuana \u201cafter granted a security clearance in July \n2018.\u201d Both allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c amount to aggravating factors for conduct \nalready identified and alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The Appeal Board has held that when the \nsame conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). For this reason, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n7 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply to the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s \ndrug involvement is recent and frequent, and his assertion he used Delta-8 THC products \ninstead of standard marijuana is not believable, given his admitted history of smoking \nmarijuana socially and enjoying it from 2012 through July 2021, and his statements he \nnever purchased marijuana during the entirety of this period. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the drug involvement security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b and 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since 2016. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015 and a master\u2019s degree in 2020. He is married without children. (Tr. at 27, 32, 40; GE 1, 3) Applicant started using marijuana in 2015, when he was in his last year of college. It increased until it was essentially daily. He used cocaine on about 10 to 15 occasions in 2015. He stopped using illegal drugs for about a year after he graduated college.

He lives in a state where marijuana possession and use do not violate any state laws. He used ecstasy (3, 4\u00ad methylenedioxy-methamphetamine or MDMA) on three occasions in 2019, and he used cocaine and LSD in 2021. He justified his drug use to himself by never using it at work or when it could affect his work.

(Transcript (Tr.) at 47) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2016. He is applying for a security clearance for the first \ntime. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015 and a master\u2019s degree in 2020. He is \nmarried without children. (Tr. at 27, 32, 40; GE 1, 3) \nApplicant started using marijuana in 2015, when he was in his last year of \ncollege. It increased until it was essentially daily. He used cocaine on about 10 to 15 \noccasions in 2015. He stopped using illegal drugs for about a year after he graduated \ncollege. (Tr. at 15-16, 22-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3; AE A) \nApplicant resumed using marijuana in 2016 after he was hired by his current \nemployer, which has a drug-free workplace policy. He lives in a state where marijuana \npossession and use do not violate any state laws. He used ecstasy (3, 4\u00ad\nmethylenedioxy-methamphetamine or MDMA) on three occasions in 2019, and he used \ncocaine and LSD in 2021. He justified his drug use to himself by never using it at work \nor when it could affect his work. (Tr. at 16-19, 24-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n1, 3; AE A) \nApplicant started using marijuana less frequently until he ended all illegal drug \nuse in about February 2022. He regrets his past drug use. He became engaged, and he \nand his wife married in August 2022. They plan to have children in the near future, and \nhe does not want drugs to be a part of their lives. He feels he has \u201cmatured away from \nthat lifestyle.\u201d He admits that his application for a security clearance played some part in \nhis decision to stop using illegal drugs, but he stated that he would have stopped even if \nhe had never applied for a clearance. He is happy with his family life and his job, and he \ndoes not intend to let drugs jeopardize either. He no longer associates outside of work \nwith the coworkers with whom he used drugs. He provided a signed statement of intent \nto abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr. \nat 20-22, 26, 29-33, 40-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3; AE A, C) \nApplicant received a substance abuse evaluation from a certified addiction \nspecialist in April 2023.

(Tr. at \n25-26, 38; GE 1, 3; AE A) \nApplicant called a witness, and he submitted documents and letters attesting to \nhis excellent job performance and strong moral character. He is praised for his work \nethic, reliability, and trustworthiness. He is recommended for a security clearance. (Tr. \nat 42-47; AE B) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana, cocaine, MDMA, and LSD. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (the Security Executive \nAgent (SecEA)) issued DNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws\nProhibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d which states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the SecEA promulgated clarifying guidance concerning \nmarijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications. It states in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including \nby signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, \nin light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug \nuse while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 \n(SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use ended before he applied for a security \nclearance. He has not used MDMA since about April 2019 (more than four and a half \nyears ago), cocaine or LSD since about January 2021 (almost three years ago), and \nmarijuana since about February 2022 (almost two years ago). His marijuana use since \n2016 occurred in a state that did not criminalize its use. \nApplicant credibly testified that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture. He fully disclosed his drug involvement on his SF-86 and throughout the security \nclearance proceedings, which bolsters his credibility. He signed a statement of intent to \nabstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. Having \nconsidered the SecEA clarifying guidance, the mitigating conditions, the whole person, \nand the Appeal Board\u2019s decisions (see, e.g., ISCR Case 22-02132 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, \n2023)), I conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that he has abstained from illegal drug use \nfor an appropriate period, and that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and \n26(b) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis.

I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline H. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant denied this allegation but provided \nno explanation for the basis of the denial. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \n \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable, and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Although Applicant\u2019s assault and battery charge \nstemming from an argument in a department store is arguably minor, his DUI was not a \nminor offense. Moreover, although not convicted, his insurance fraud charge is not minor, \neither. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca pattern of minor offenses, any one of \nwhich on its own would be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but \nwhich in combination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s open arrest warrant constitutes a credible allegation of criminal \nconduct. Together with the two previous charges, I conclude that AG \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence \n(including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official \nrecord) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted,\u201d applies. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent allegation is the most troubling because it is a crime of \nduplicity, and as such, epitomizes the type of conduct which is disqualifying. Although \nApplicant denied this allegation, he provided no evidence rebutting this charge, nor any \nother evidence, generally, that could potentially mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns. Under these circumstances, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F. Financial Considerations \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant allegedly committed fraud to receive a settlement from an insurance\ncompany to which he was not entitled. AG \u00b6 19(d), \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices \nsuch as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust,\u201d \napplies. Applicant\u2019s conduct is disqualifying under the financial considerations security\nconcern for the same reasons it is disqualifying under the criminal conduct security\nconcern. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;(5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \nI considered the whole-person concept in my application of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions of the guidelines, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.c \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense (DOD) \ncould not determine that it was clearly consistent with the interests of national security for \nApplicant to have access to classified information, as required by Executive Order 10865, \nas amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nOn January 31, 2023, DOD sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts and security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken pursuant to and consistent with Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that Applicant received on March 18, 2023. The FORM contained seven exhibits \n(Items 1 \u2013 7) on which the Government relies to support the SOR allegations. Applicant \nhad 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any of the Government\u2019s exhibits or to \nprovide other additional information. He did not submit any further information, and he did \nnot file any objections to the Government\u2019s exhibits within the allotted time. The record \nclosed on April 17, 2023, and I received the case for decision on June 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $51,485 for 16 delinquent \nor past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.p). The nine debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.i are for \ndelinquent student loans totaling $45,470, or about 88 percent of the total alleged in the \nSOR. In response to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations and provided \nexplanations and supporting documents. (FORM, Item 1) In addition to the facts \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and based on my review of the information \npresented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a single, 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he \nhas worked since July 2021. He has two children, ages 6 and 14, for whom he is obligated \nto provide monthly support payments. He served in the Army National Guard between \n2001 and 2007, and in the Navy Reserve from 2008 until 2011. (FORM, Items 2 and 3) \nApplicant earned an associate degree in 2013, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. \nHe used a combination of student loans and educational benefits from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) to finance his tuition. This appears to be his first application for a \nsecurity clearance. (FORM, Items 2 and 3) \nIn the e-QIP he submitted in August 2021, Applicant disclosed that he was behind \non his child support payments in the amount of $2,300, but that he was making weekly \npayments of $63.50 to resolve that debt. During the ensuing background investigation, \navailable information showed, as alleged at SOR 1.j, that he owed $4,100 for past-due \nchild support. In response to the SOR, he admitted this debt; however, he also provided \ninformation showing he has paid off that debt and that he was able to do so after saving \nmoney once he gained full-time employment in 2021. The most recent credit report \nsubmitted by the Government shows that his child support account is current.

Again, he cited \nunemployment as the underlying reason he incurred those debts. During Applicant\u2019s \nbackground investigation, available information showed, as alleged in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.i, that \nhe owes $45,470 in delinquent student loans. The most recent credit report provided by \nthe Government shows that these accounts are still delinquent as alleged. In response to \nthe SOR, he provided information showing that on February 7, 2023, he enrolled in an \nincome-based student loan rehabilitation program with the U.S. Department of Education. \nAside from a two-page letter acknowledging his enrollment, he did not provide any \ninformation about his income, a schedule of payments, or a record of previous payments. \nHe also did not explain why he did not enroll in the program earlier; however, the letter \nmentions \u201cthe payment pause.\u201d This likely refers to the payment pause on student loans \nprovided for through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act \nsigned into law by President Trump in 2020. The moratorium on student loan payments \nwas extended by President Biden, but is now scheduled to end in October 2023. (FORM, \nItems 1 and 3) \nAvailable information also supports the allegations of the delinquent debts at SOR \n1.k \u2013 1.p. SOR 1.k is for a delinquent gym membership referred to a collection agency. \nApplicant admits he once had an account with that creditor, but avers he satisfied all of \ntheir requirements when he left the gym but was charged for another year anyway. He \nhas been trying unsuccessfully to contact the gym and the collection agency. SOR 1.l is \nfor a delinquent cell phone account. Applicant also disputes this account and has been \nunable to contact the creditor or to obtain any current information about this debt. Neither \nof the debts alleged in SOR 1.k and 1.l are more than seven years old, but they do not \nappear on the two most recent credit reports provided by the Government. (FORM, Items \n1, 3 \u2013 7) \nThe debts at SOR 1.m and 1.n are for past-due utility accounts. SOR 1.o and 1.p \nare for past-due medical bills that were not covered by insurance. None of these debts \nappear on the most recent credit reports and with his Answer, Applicant provided \ninformation showing he has paid both debts. (FORM, Items 1, 3 \u2013 7) \nBefore being hired for his current job, Applicant was self-employed as a \nphotographer and graphics designer between April 2020 and July 2021. This was only \npart-time work, and he supported himself with help from his parents and by donating \nplasma for money twice weekly. It was not until he started his current employment that \nhe had reliable full-time income and benefits. Between January 2017 and April 2020, he \nwas unemployed four times for a total of 25 months. When he discussed his financial \nproblems during his PSI, and in his response to the SOR, he cited his unemployment two \nof those three years as the underlying cause of his financial problems. He further averred \nthat now that he is steadily employed with a defense contractor, he is able to repay his \ndebts and to meet all of his current financial obligations.

(See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information supports the SOR allegations and reasonably raises the \nsecurity concern about finances stated at \u00b6 AG 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, this record requires application of the following AG \u00b6 19 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe record also supports application of the following pertinent mitigating conditions \navailable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply because Applicant\u2019s debts are the result of being \nunemployed for 25 of the 39 months between January 2017 and April 2020. Even then, \nhe was self-employed on a part-time basis for the next 15 months before being hired by \na defense contractor in July 2021. Since being steadily employed, he has resolved a child \nsupport arrearage and several smaller debts.

Applicant provided the names of two of these employees. (Tr. p. \n72.) He mentioned that there are others, but he has only learned about them through \nthe grapevine. \nApplicant stated that he has now stopped using marijuana since he has become \naware of the security obligations required to obtain a security clearance. During the \nyears he used marijuana he also purchased it about once or twice a month to supply his \nhabit. (Tr. p. 43.) \n1.c. and 1.d. Applicant has used and purchased cocaine nine times from about 2015 to \nApril 2021. He used cocaine in social settings with his friends. He stated that he did \nnot enjoy it.

He \nexplained that he used it as a study aid. He would usually use these drugs with friends \nin his study group. \n1.f. \nApplicant used Tramadol on one occasion in October 2017. He remembers that \nhe had pain from a laceration on his hand. His sister had a pill left over from her \nwisdom tooth removal, and she gave it to him. \n1.g. \nApplicant used Vicodin on one occasion in about July 2018. He suffered a \nhamstring injury while playing intramural football and a friend offered his Vicodin to him. \n1.h. \nApplicant used and purchased Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) on two \noccasions, once in March 2017, and again in May 2017. He acknowledges that he was \nyoung and na\u00efve at the time. He was outdoors in a nature setting or going on a hike at \nthe time he used it. He stated that he did not really enjoy it, and he understood the risks \nassociated with the drug. \n1.i. \nApplicant sold marijuana in 2017. He explained that he was responsible for \ntaking the marijuana to a friend of his, and then returning the money to another friend \nwho owned the marijuana, who had asked him to do the favor. (Tr. p. 55-56.) Applicant \ndid not receive any money for his efforts. \n1.j. \nApplicant used and purchased Xanax not prescribed to him on two occasions in \nabout August 2015. \nApplicant admitted that he made a knowing and conscious decision to use these \ndrugs when he did so, and he knew that he violated both state and Federal law when he \nused marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and hallucinogenic mushrooms. (Tr. pp. 63-66.) \nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s Senior Manager and other \nprofessional colleagues, including a roommate, attest to Applicant\u2019s high level of \nmaturity and job responsibility. \nApplicant is considered to be a highly driven \nprofessional and the go-to person as an expert in certain areas as an Engineer and \nData Analyst. Applicant\u2019s good character, work ethic, and commitment to the principles \nof integrity and confidentiality are noted. However, only one individual who provided a \nletter of recommendation for Applicant makes any reference to being aware of \nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use, and characterizes it as occurring prior to his \nemployment with the company, which is not accurate. Applicant testified that he did not \nshow the SOR to any of those who submitted letters on his behalf, and although he only \nverbally discussed some of the allegations with them, he did not provide them with \nspecifics. Applicant testified that his Senior Manager, who has supported him, told the \nsecurity officer that if Applicant were to be denied his security clearance, steps would be \ntaken to keep him on the program.

(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \nNotes concerning Applicant\u2019s performance appraisals indicate that he was an \nexcellent performer in 2021, and that he continues to be impressive, showing \noutstanding job performance. \nHe is described as a hard worker whose skill and \ndiligence has helped to make the projects successful. He continues to be an extremely \nvaluable member of the team as he continues to expand his knowledge and \nunderstanding of various aspects of his job responsibilities.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant has used a wide variety of illegal drugs from about July 2015 to about \nMarch 2022. These drugs include marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, LSD, \nprescription medication not prescribed to him, namely Adderall, Vyvanse, Tramadol, \nVicodin, and Xanox. Some are very dangerous mind-altering drugs. Applicant used \nmarijuana the most frequently, in upwards of 1,000 times. \nHe continued to use \nmarijuana after he was hired and working for a defense contractor, and after applying \nfor a security clearance, in total disregard of DoD policies and Federal law. Applicant is \nexpected to show a high level of maturity, trustworthiness and good judgment. In this \ncase, Applicant has fallen short of meeting these eligibility requirements. In fact, given \nApplicant\u2019s extensive history of illegal drug involvement, he does not meet the \nrequirements for eligibility to access classified information. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant is a fairly recent college graduate \nwho used a wide variety of illegal drugs and chose to live his life to his convenience, \nand has disregarded the law. Knowing that the use of marijuana is illegal, Applicant has \ndisregarded the law. Under the particular facts of this case, at this time, Applicant does \nnot show the requisite character or judgment of someone who has the maturity, \nintegrity, good judgment, and reliability necessary to access classified information. At \nthis time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not demonstrated the level \nof maturity needed for access to classified information. This is not an individual in \nwhom the Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. This is dangerous and \nunacceptable. Applicant is not qualified for access to classified information, and does \nnot meet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j. \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Industrial Engineering \nand a minor in Mathematics. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Project \nManager. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant has an extensive history of purchasing and using illegal drugs including \nmarijuana, cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), and \nthe use of prescription drugs not prescribed to him include Adderall, Vyvanse, \nTramadol, Vicodin and Xanax.

Given the \nseven years he has used marijuana, he admits to using it over 1,000 times. (Tr. p. 63.) \nHe would normally use it in social settings with his friends. During the years he used \nmarijuana he also purchased it about once or twice a month to supply his habit. (Tr. p. \n43.) \nIn July 2021, Applicant began working for a defense contractor in a sensitive \nposition. He continued to use marijuana while holding a sensitive position until at least \nMarch 2022, in total disregard for his security responsibilities. Applicant testified from \nhis personal knowledge that there are people at his company who use marijuana and \nwho hold security clearances. \nApplicant provided the names of two of these \nemployees.

Applicant has used and purchased cocaine nine times from about 2015 to \nApril 2021. He used cocaine in social settings with his friends. He stated that he did \nnot enjoy it. He also used and purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms three times from \nSeptember 2016 to about March 2021. He did not particularly enjoy this experience \neither. (Tr. p. 47-48.) \n1.e. \nApplicant has used and purchased prescription medications, namely Adderall \nand Vyvanse not prescribed to him, from about August 2016 to November 2018. He \nexplained that he used it as a study aid. He would usually use these drugs with friends \nin his study group. \n1.f. \nApplicant used Tramadol on one occasion in October 2017. He remembers that \nhe had pain from a laceration on his hand. His sister had a pill left over from her \nwisdom tooth removal, and she gave it to him. \n1.g. \nApplicant used Vicodin on one occasion in about July 2018. He suffered a \nhamstring injury while playing intramural football and a friend offered his Vicodin to him. \n1.h. \nApplicant used and purchased Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) on two \noccasions, once in March 2017, and again in May 2017. He acknowledges that he was \nyoung and na\u00efve at the time. He was outdoors in a nature setting or going on a hike at \nthe time he used it. He stated that he did not really enjoy it, and he understood the risks \nassociated with the drug. \n1.i. \nApplicant denied that he ever sold marijuana. However, he admitted that in \n2017, on one occasion, he was the middleman responsible for taking the marijuana to a \nfriend of his, and then returning the money to another friend who owned the marijuana. \n(Tr. p. 55-56.) Applicant stated that he did not receive any money for his efforts. \n1.j. \nApplicant used and purchased Xanax not prescribed to him on two occasions in \nabout August 2015. \nApplicant admitted that he made a knowing and conscious decision to use these \ndrugs when he did so, and he knew that he was violating both state and Federal law \nwhen he used marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and hallucinogenic mushrooms.  (Tr. pp. 63-\n66.)   \nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s Senior Manager and other \nprofessional colleagues, including a roommate, attest to Applicant\u2019s high level of \nmaturity and job responsibility. \nApplicant is considered to be a highly driven \nprofessional and the go-to person as an expert in certain areas as an Engineer and \nData Analyst.

Applicant testified that his Senior Manager, who has supported him, told the \nsecurity officer that if Applicant were to be denied his security clearance, steps would be \ntaken to keep him on the program.  (Tr. p. 75, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E and I.) \nHair Drug Test results dated March 1, 2023; March 24, 2023; May 11, 2023; and \nJune 8, 2023, were negative. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and H.) \nApplicant submitted a statement of intent dated March 23, 2023, declaring that \nhe will never misuse substances in the future. He stated that he plans to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledges that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \nNotes concerning Applicant\u2019s performance appraisals indicate that he was an \nexcellent performer in 2021, and that he continues to be impressive, showing \noutstanding job performance. \nHe is described as a hard worker whose skill and \ndiligence has helped to make the projects successful. He continues to be an extremely \nvaluable member of the team as he continues to expand his knowledge and \nunderstanding of various aspects of his job responsibilities.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant has a long history of drug abuse, as set forth in the Findings of Fact. \nMore specifically, from July 2021 through March 2022, Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana while employed with a defense contractor and while holding a sensitive \nposition. AG \u00b6 25a, 25c, and 25f are applicable. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions demonstrate full mitigation: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement in the future. However, he has an extensive history of illegal drug use, \ninvolving a wide variety of illegal drugs, used on various occasions over a recent seven \nyear period, from about July 2015 to March 2022. \nThese facts, coupled with his \ncontinued use of marijuana after being hired by a defense contractor and while holding \na sensitive position, support a finding that he fails to show the requisite character and \njudgment required to meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. Some of the drugs he used are very dangerous mind-altering drugs. It is \nnoted that Applicant\u2019s drug of choice was clearly marijuana, as he used it most \nfrequently, in upwards of 1,000 times. He continued to use marijuana after being hired \nby a defense contractor and while holding a sensitive position. Applicant completely \ndisregarded DoD policies and company rules and regulations. In order to meet the \neligibility requirements for access to classified information, Applicant is expected to \nshow a high level of maturity, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nIn this case, \nApplicant has fallen short of meeting these eligibility requirements. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant is a fairly recent college graduate \nwho used a wide variety of illegal drugs before he entered the defense industry, and he \ncontinued to use marijuana after he began working for a defense contractor and while \nholding a sensitive position. Applicant has disregarded DoD policies and company \nsecurity rules and regulations. Under the particular facts of this case, at this time, \nApplicant does not show the requisite character or judgment of someone who has the \nmaturity, integrity, good judgment, and reliability necessary to access classified \ninformation. At this time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to \nclassified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not demonstrated the level \nof maturity needed for access to classified information. This is not an individual in \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhom the Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. Applicant is not \nqualified for access to classified information, and does not meet the qualifications for a \nsecurity clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under paragraph 1.a - that Applicant used marijuana at different frequencies from January 2019 to June 2022; 1.b - that he used marijuana while granted access to classified information from June 2020 to June 2022; 1.c - that he stated an intention to discontinue use of marijuana in his April 2020 PSI, but continued using marijuana until June 2022; 1.d - that during a PSI in August 2022, he expressed his intention to continue using marijuana in the future. Applicant admitted the four allegations. Applicant is 40 years old and single with an 18-year-son. After obtaining his high school diploma in 2001, he attended a technical college for three years, but did not receive a diploma. He earned his associate\u2019s degree in December 2019, and is taking courses for his bachelor\u2019s degree. He has been employed by a defense contractor as a configuration analyst since February 2020. From July 2005 to February 2020, he was a shipping loader for a nationwide discount department store. In his March 2020 e-QIP, Applicant indicated that in the last seven years, he used marijuana one or two times a week from January 2019 to October 2019. He started using the drug because he wanted to relieve his back pain with a natural drug rather than medicine. He purchased and used a vaporizer dispensing pen (Item 2 at 32) for ingesting the marijuana. On the next page of the March 2020 security clearance application, Applicant explained that the marijuana relieved his anxiety. ",

On the next page of the March 2020 security clearance \napplication, Applicant explained that the marijuana relieved his anxiety. However, he \nstopped using the drug in October 2019 because it was against the law in the state \nwhere he lives and works. He acknowledged that he would continue using marijuana if it \nwas legal and not prohibited by his employer. (Item 2 at 33) In his April 2020 PSI, he \ndeclared he would never use marijuana while working for the federal government or if \nhe had a government security clearance. (Item 4 at 4) He was granted a security \nclearance in June 2020. \nApplicant certified a second e-QIP in June 2022.

He was spending about $60 a month on the drug. His justification for \ncontinuing to use marijuana was that he did not know it was still considered illegal under \nfederal law.

He predicted \nthat it was likely he will continue to use \u201cdrugs\u201d in the future and will use \u201cmarijuana\u201d in \nthe future to manage his back pain. He has made no attempt to reduce or stop his \nmarijuana use. (Item 4 at 10) After making one minor change in the April 2020 and the \nAugust 2022 PSI, Applicant swore that both PSIs were accurate.

All available \nand reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \n3 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of the Director of \nNational Intelligence Memorandum Adherence of Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, (October 25, 2014), Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, which \nclearly states that state laws do not authorize persons to violate federal law, including \nthe Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which identifies \nmarijuana as a Schedule 1 controlled drug. \nChanges in state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use \ndo not change the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017). An individual\u2019s disregard of the \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana involvement remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that \nfederal law remains unchanged with respect to illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Disregard of federal law relevant to marijuana (including prior \nrecreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but not determinative to adjudications of \nsecurity clearance eligibility. Agencies are required to employ the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine if an applicant\u2019s behavior raises a security \nconcern that has not been mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to commit clearly and convincingly to discontinue such \nmisuse. \n4 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana from January 2019 to the present, \ncorroborated by his 2020 and 2022 e-QIPs, his March 2020 and his August 2022 PSIs, \nhis interrogatory answers in March 2023, and his answers to the April 2023 SOR, \nestablish the four disqualifying conditions identified above. Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana \nuse is aggravated by the fact that he received a security clearance in June 2020, after \nhe declared three months earlier that he stopped in October 2019, and would not use \nillegal drugs as long as he worked for the federal government if he had a security \nclearance. Finally, he confirmed that he will continue to use marijuana and continue \nsocializing with his drug using friends. \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is unavailable for mitigation as Applicant has admitted that he will \nuse marijuana in the future. Accordingly, his admission continues to cast doubt on his \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. \nThough Applicant admits his involvement with marijuana, he has furnished no \nindependent evidence of action taken to overcome his illegal drug use, with the \nobjective of abstaining from all future drug use. \nBecause Applicant maintains ties with his friends who use drugs, there is no \nbasis to find that he has attempted to avoid or change the environment where drugs are \nused. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) do not apply. Applicant has not submitted a signed \nstatement of intent to forgo future use of all drug involvement, acknowledging that any \n5 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfuture use is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. AG \u00b6 23(b)(3) does \nnot apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He has an 18-year-old son. He has been working as \na configuration analyst for a February 2020. \nHolding a security clearance is a 24-hour-responsibilty which requires \ncompliance with all federal laws at work and after work, or even when the clearance is \ninactive, and regardless of the amount of classified information the holder may handle at \na given time. Even though some states have decriminalized marijuana use, it is still \nillegal at the federal level for federal contract employees. Medical marijuana assigns no \nspecial status under the adjudicative guidelines. See ISCR Case No. 20-02794 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb.1, 2022) In sum, an individual who has been granted access to classified \ninformation cannot use illegal drugs under any circumstances. Thus, medical issues do \nnot create an exception to the federal Government\u2019s policy against illegal drug use. \nHaving weighed and balanced the record from a whole-person point of view, Applicant\u2019s \nevidence in mitigation does not overcome the security concerns based on the drug \ninvolvement. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n6 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The police report indicates that three \nmen reported that they worked in a market in an area where burglaries had occurred. \nAn individual later identified as Applicant pulled his vehicle into the back of the market. \nThey were suspicious and followed him home after he left. They went up to him after he \npulled into his driveway. They described Applicant as belligerent and yelling, and he \nthen pulled out a shotgun and loaded it. One of the men reported that Applicant said, \n\u201cI\u2019ve got something for you,\u201d and pointed the shotgun at him. Applicant then fired the \nshotgun at the man\u2019s vehicle, damaging a tire with the birdshot. Another man stated that \nApplicant pointed the shotgun at him, kicked him, and struck his truck\u2019s tail lamp with \nthe shotgun, damaging the vehicle. (GE 2) \nApplicant was charged with three felony counts of aggravated assault with a \ndeadly weapon. He was required to wear an ankle monitor. In June 2021, an indictment \nwas filed; Applicant\u2019s attorney entered an appearance; a $40,000 bond was set; and \nApplicant had an arraignment hearing. He was admitted into the state\u2019s veterans court \nprogram in September 2022 and received a pretrial diversion program for 24 months. \nHe handwrote a non-judicial confession as follows: \u201cGot chased to my house by 3 or \nmore individuals \u2013 I was intoxicated and when things [calmed] down, they walked away \nand I shot their truck with my shotgun because I was upset.\u201d (Tr. at 18; GE 2-4) \nTerms of the pretrial diversion program include that Applicant report to a \nsupervision officer at least once a month; not commit any crime; not travel out of state; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabstain from alcohol and illegal drugs; undergo screening and evaluation and any \nalcohol or drug rehabilitation program ordered by the probation department; complete \nan anger management program; submit to a random urinalysis; perform 180 hours of \ncommunity service; observe a curfew from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.; grant permission for \nany probation or pretrial services officer to enter his dwelling at any time to search the \npremises; and pay $850 as a veterans treatment court fee. If he successfully completes \nthe program, the charges will be dismissed. (Tr. at 18, 44-45; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s current version of the January 2021 events differs from the three \nmen\u2019s statements and from his own non-judicial confession. On March 20, 2023. he \nwrote in his response to DoD interrogatories: \nOn 1/12/21 I went duck hunting for the majority of the day and then to a \nrestaurant to have dinner. After dinner I drove to a fish market and marina \nto visit a friend who had a houseboat at the back of the small property. At \nthis point I was unaware that the property had been burglarize[d] recently. \nI drove my truck to the back of the property where the houseboat is \nlocated, I realized the person I was there to see was not at the boat. At \nthis point it was dark out, I turned my truck around to leave and drove \nback the way I came. \nUpon getting back to the parking lot three men came out of the building \nand continued to walk towards my truck in an aggressive manner yelling \nas I was leaving the property. I could see the men get in their trucks and \nstart to follow me as I drove away. I started to speed up as they got closer, \nthe situation turned into an aggressive and fast chase, I started to fear for \nmy safety.  \nThey continue[d] to chase me back to my house and to my driveway \nwhere I exited my vehicle and went inside my garage with my shotgun that \nI had in my truck from duck hunting. Two trucks pulled up to my driveway \nand house, one of the men got out [and] walked up my driveway and into \nmy garage in an aggressive and threatening manner. At that point I was \nafraid for my life and my family inside the house. I loaded the shotgun \npointing it at the man in my garage, yelled at the man to get out of my \ngarage and off my property. He turned around and walked back down my \ndriveway as I follow[ed] from a distance. At this point I was yelling at the \nmen to leave, I was scared, the circumstances had my adrenaline \npumping giving me shakes.  \nThat is when the gun that was pointed down misfired and hit one of the \ntruck[\u2019]s wheels a few feet away at the end of my driveway. One of the \nother men got out of another truck [and] chased me back to my house, I \nfelt threatened and kicked at the man yelling at him to leave. I hit the \ntaillight with the butt of the shotgun and broke the taillight. The men drove \naway in their trucks and shortly after the police arrived.

He stated that he was duck hunting for 10 to 12 \nhours and had \u201c[n]o more than maybe one [drink] per hour.\u201d He stated the shotgun \ndischarged accidentally when one of the men started fighting with him.

(GE 8) \nApplicant submitted an SF 86 in July 2021. (GE 1) He did not report any of his \ncriminal charges under any of the questions, including questions that asked: \nIn the past seven (7) years have you been arrested by any police officer, \nsheriff, marshal or any other type of law enforcement official? \nIn the past seven (7) years have you been charged, convicted, or \nsentenced of a crime in any court? \nAre you currently on trial or awaiting trial on criminal charges? \nHave you ever been charged with any felony offense? (Include those \nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice and non-military/civilian felony \noffenses) \nHave you ever been charged with an offense involving firearms or \nexplosives? and \nHave you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs? \nApplicant denied that he intentionally provided false information on the SF 86. He \nstated his attorney told him that he did not have to report the 2021 arrest because he \nhad not been charged or convicted. He did not have a good explanation for why he \nfailed to divulge the arrest. Additionally, he had not been convicted, but he had been \ncharged and an arraignment hearing was held in June 2021, the month before he \nsubmitted the SF 86. He stated that he forgot about the older charges; he thought the \ngovernment already knew about the information; and the 2014 DUI had been dismissed \nand it was past the seven-year reporting period.

His recent descriptions of \nthe January 2021 events are not logical; there are inconsistencies between his \nresponse to interrogatories and his testimony; and his response to interrogatories and \ntestimony are both inconsistent with his non-judicial confession (three distinct versions \nof how the shotgun was fired). I also find that he intentionally provided false information \nabout the incident in his response to interrogatories when he stated the shotgun \n\u201cmisfired.\u201d I further find he intentionally provided false information on the 2015 and 2021 \nSF 86s (discussed further in the analysis). \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to his excellent job performance and strong \nmoral character. He is praised for his attention to detail, leadership, respect for others, \nwork ethic, and trustworthiness, He is described as \u201ca family-oriented person who has \nalways presented himself with levelheadedness and grace.\u201d (AE A-C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand  \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nThe SOR alleges the 2021 arrest, and that Applicant will be under supervision as \npart of a pretrial diversion program until at least July 2024. AG \u00b6 31(b) is applicable. \nEverything about the pretrial diversion program reads like probation, including that at \nleast part of it is monitored by the state probation department. It is not technically \nprobation, and AG \u00b6 31(c) is not technically applicable. However, the same concerns \ngenerated by an individual being on probation are also generated here. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe charges against Applicant are serious. They are on hold pending his \nsuccessful completion of the veterans court pretrial diversion program. Most importantly, \nI do not believe him. I find he was dishonest about the incident in his response to \ninterrogatories and at his hearing. Absent complete candor, there can be no mitigation. \nHis criminal conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI and DWI in 2005 and 2014. He had two alcohol-\nrelated incidents in the military, and he was intoxicated at the time of the 2021 incident \nwith a shotgun. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has\nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory\nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s misconduct as an adult has been alcohol related. He has not \nfully accepted responsibility for that misconduct, nor the influence alcohol had on his \nactions. He is required by the pretrial diversion program to abstain from alcohol, and \nthere is no evidence he has violated that provision. Nonetheless, I have lingering doubts \nabout his drinking and the extremely poor judgment he exhibited while drinking. None of \nthe mitigating conditions are sufficiently applicable to overcome concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use, reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified the 2021 SF 86 when he \nfailed to report the January 2021 arrest and charges under the questions that asked: \nIn the past seven (7) years have you been arrested by any police officer, \nsheriff, marshal or any other type of law enforcement official? \nIn the past seven (7) years have you been charged, convicted, or \nsentenced of a crime in any court? and \nAre you currently on trial or awaiting trial on criminal charges? \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated his attorney told him that he did not have to report the 2021 \narrest because he had not been charged or convicted. He did not have a good \nexplanation for why he failed to divulge the arrest. Additionally, his testimony that he \nhad not yet been charged when he submitted the SF 86 is inaccurate. He had been \ncharged, an arraignment hearing was held in June 2021, the month before he submitted \nthe SF 86, and he was awaiting trial on those criminal charges. He intentionally \nprovided false information on his 2021 SF 86 when he failed to report his arrest and \ncharges earlier in the year. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable to the omissions on the 2021 SF \n86. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified the 2021 SF 86 when he \nfailed to report the January 2021 charges, the 2005 and 2014 DUI and DWI charges, \nand his felony burglary charge in 1999 under the questions that asked: \nHave you ever been charged with any felony offense? (Include those \nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice and non-military/civilian felony \noffenses) \nHave you ever been charged with an offense involving firearms or \nexplosives? and \nHave you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs? \nI am not convinced by substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally falsified \nthe SF 86 by failing to divulge the 2005 and 2014 DUI and DWI charges and his felony \nburglary charge in 1999 when he was 14 years old. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to \nthose omissions. I am convinced by substantial evidence that he intentionally falsified \nthe SF 86 by failing to divulge the 2021 charges. However, had he divulged those \ncharges under the previous questions alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, he would not have been \nrequired to divulge then under this question. The security concerns raised by the \nfalsification of the 2021 SF 86 are sufficiently addressed under SOR \u00b6 2.a. SOR \u00b6 2.b is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c \nApplicant intentionally provided false information on his 2015 SF 86 when he \nfailed to report his 2014 DWI charge.

SOR \u00b6 \n2.c also alleges that he intentionally falsified the 2015 SF 86 when he failed to report the \n2005 DUI charge and his felony burglary charge in 1999.

I find he \nintentionally lied in the interrogatory response when he stated that the shotgun \n\u201cmisfired.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable to that matter. \nSOR \u00b6 2.h \nSOR \u00b6 2.h alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified the 2002 security \nclearance application when he failed to report that in 1999, when he was about 14 years \nold, he was charged with felony burglary, graffiti, and criminal mischief. I am not \nconvinced by substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally falsified the 2002 security \nclearance application by failing to divulge that information. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable \nto that matter. SOR \u00b6 2.h is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f, 2.g, and 2.i-2.m \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct as a juvenile and while in the military, and his three \npost-military arrests were cross-alleged as personal conduct. His conduct reflects \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It \nalso created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \napplicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is \nsufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal conduct and alcohol \nconsumption guidelines. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment \nand an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and \n16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct in 1999 and 2000 occurred when he was about 14 \nand 15 years old. That conduct no longer has any security significance. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f and \n2.g are concluded for Applicant.  \nThe remaining criminal conduct security concerns, as cross-alleged under \npersonal conduct, are not mitigated under the same analyses addressed above under \nGuidelines G and J. Additionally, having determined that Applicant intentionally provided \nfalse information in an attempt to mislead the government, I have also determined that \nhis testimony about those statements was also false. It would be inconsistent to find his \nconduct mitigated.1 \n1 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, G, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and his favorable character evidence. However, he has \nmultiple alcohol-related offenses, he remains under the supervision of the state, and he \ncannot be trusted to tell the truth. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E, G, and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant (except the \nlanguage about the 2005 DUI \nand the 1999 burglary, which are \nfound For Applicant) \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.f-2.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.i-2.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

In Applicant\u2019s August 3, 2020 \nSCA, she disclosed that she failed to file her federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 and \n2018 due to forgetfulness, and she intended to get these tax returns filed. (GE 1) \nIn Applicant\u2019s September 2, 2020 OPM personal subject interview, she indicated \nshe failed to file her tax returns for TYs 2017, 2018, and 2019. (GE 3) She said she was \nforgetful, and she needed to obtain her divorce decree to enable her to take a dependent \ndeduction for her daughter. (Id.) She promised to take care of her tax returns within one \nweek of her OPM interview. (Id.) She subsequently learned that her former husband was \nauthorized under her divorce decree to take the dependent deduction for her daughter. \n(Tr. 37) \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a tax return transcript for \nTY 2019, which indicated she filed her tax return for TY 2019 on February 15, 2022. (Tr. \n26; GE 2) In her SOR response, Applicant said: \nMy failing to file is not due to financial instability, but a mixture of poor \nmemory and execution paralysis which are symptoms of my ADHD. I have \nsince acquired assistance [to] ensure that I have timely filed ever since. \nAdmittedly, during this investigation I have struggled to file these years and \nacquire transcripts in a timely manner. I have managed to file 2 of the 3 \nyears thus far and [I provided] transcripts for one. (HE 2) \nApplicant said during her hearing that she filed her federal income tax returns for \nTYs 2018, 2019, and 2020; however, she has not filed her tax returns for 2017 because \nshe has not received a W2 from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). \n(Tr. 19) She was unsure about when she filed her TY 2018 federal income tax return. (Tr. \n27) She believed she received refunds for TYs 2018 and 2019. (Tr. 27) She had memory \nissues, and it was difficult for her to focus on completion of her tax returns. (Tr. 22) She \nbelieved she filed her TY 2020 federal income tax return on time. (Tr. 28)  \nIn April 2023, Applicant asked the IRS to provide her W2s for TY 2017. (Tr. 24) \nShe believes the IRS will prepare and file her 2017 federal income tax return around April \nof 2024. (Tr. 24, 34) Applicant admitted that she failed to file her state tax returns for TYs \n2017, 2018, and 2019 in her SOR response, and she gave the same explanation and \nmitigating information that she provided for her federal income tax returns, which were \nnot timely filed. \nOn August 20, 2023, Applicant asked the IRS to provide her tax transcripts for TYs \n2018 through 2022. (AE A at 1) The tax transcripts show the IRS received her TY 2019 \ntax return on February 15, 2022, her TY 2020 tax return on April 15, 2021, her TY 2022 \ntax return on April 15, 2022, and her tax return for TY 2022 on April 15, 2023.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns . . . as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying condition in \nAG \u00b6 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying condition is contained in the mitigation section, \ninfra. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 which may be \napplicable in this case are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. She said she filed her \ntax returns for TYs 2018 and 2019; however, she filed them late, most likely around \nFebruary 2022. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a \nfederal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile her federal income tax returns against her as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile her federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 through 2019, the DOHA Appeal Board \nhas commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. \n20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this instance, Applicant did not file two of her overdue federal and state income \ntax returns until after she completed her SCA and had her OPM interview, but before she \nreceived the SOR. She had not filed her federal and state income tax return for TY 2017 \nas of the date of her hearing. Under all the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s failures to timely \nfile her federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2017 through 2019 are not mitigated \nat this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old database administrator who has worked for her current \nemployer for about two years. In 2012, she graduated from high school. She attended \ncollege, and she has less than 25 college credits. She served in the Air Force from 2014 \nto 2017, and she received a general discharge under honorable conditions.

She \nadmitted that she made errors in regard to filing her tax returns; she intends to learn from \nthose mistakes; and she promised not to repeat them. She has been making progress \ngetting her tax returns filed. She is receiving assistance in financial matters from her \nmother who lives with her. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial \nconsiderations section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial at this time than the \nevidence of mitigation. Applicant did not establish that she was unable to timely file her \nfederal and state income tax returns for TYs 2017, 2018, and 2019. Her failure to take \ntimely, prudent, responsible, good-faith actions from 2018 to 2020 (when those tax returns \nwere due) to get her tax returns timely filed raise unmitigated questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

He deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan while on active duty. He received separation pay of about $121,000. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) gave him a disability rating of 50%, which equated to tax-free payments of about $1,250 a month. The VA increased the disability rating to 100% in about December 2022, which raised the monthly payments to about $4,000 a month.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since about April 2023. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2021. He \nis married with two children. (Tr. at 20-26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2001 until he was \nhonorably discharged for medical reasons in 2017. He deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan \nwhile on active duty. He received separation pay of about $121,000. The Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) gave him a disability rating of 50%, which equated to tax-free \npayments of about $1,250 a month. The VA increased the disability rating to 100% in \nabout December 2022, which raised the monthly payments to about $4,000 a month. \n(Tr. at 17-19, 22, 25, 33, 44-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant has a history of buying and selling vehicles, and sometimes turning \nthem back as a voluntary repossession. In about 2012, he voluntarily surrendered the \ncar that was driven by his wife after she lost her job. A credit report from August 2019 \nlisted the account as opened in November 2012 with a high credit of $45,463. The \ncreditor charged off $20,616 in about May 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant has not made \nany payments on the deficiency balance owed on the loan. (Tr. at 14, 29-30, 35-39; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-5) \nApplicant purchased and financed vehicles in about September 2016 and March \n2017. When he learned he was being discharged from the military, he decided to \nvoluntarily surrender both vehicles, buy a new home, and use the money that would \nhave gone to the vehicle loans to pay the mortgage for the new home. The February \n2023 credit report lists the two accounts as charged off, with balances of $40,658 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a) and $21,986 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Tr. at 17-18, 31-34, 37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1-5) \nApplicant attended college after his discharge. In addition to his separation pay, \nhe lived off his VA disability pay, the GI Bill, and his wife\u2019s limited income. He worked for \nabout ten months in 2020, but his employment has been sporadic. A security clearance \nwill greatly increase his economic opportunities. (Tr. at 15, 20-25, 42-44; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant has not paid any of the vehicle accounts, and he does not intend to. He \nsees no financial value in paying for vehicles he does not possess. The mortgage \naccount on the house he bought in 2017 is listed on the August 2019 credit report with a \nhigh credit of $212,798 and a balance of $204,843. He refinanced the mortgage with the \nsame financial institution in March 2022. The February 2023 credit report shows a final \npayment on the original mortgage loan of $192,525. That report lists the new mortgage \nloan with a high credit of $288,000, with monthly payments of $1,384, and a balance of \n$283,315. (Tr. at 30-31, 34, 38-41, 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4) \nApplicant bought a vehicle financed through a loan of about $56,321 in July \n2021.

(Tr. at 38-40; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 4, 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of defaulted auto loans, vehicle repossessions, and \nunpaid deficiency balances on those loans. The evidence indicates that it was initially \ndifficult for him to pay his auto loans, but at some point, he just chose not to pay the \ndeficiency balances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed the 2012 repossession to his wife losing her job. He never \npaid the deficiency balance due on the loan, but that debt is so old that it no longer has \nany independent security significance. SOR \u00b6 1.c is mitigated. \nIn anticipation of his discharge from the military, Applicant decided to voluntarily \nsurrender both of his vehicles, buy a new home, and use the money that would have \ngone to the vehicle loans to pay the mortgage for a new home. He chose to attend \ncollege and not use any of his separation pay on the vehicle loans. His discharge was \nbeyond his control. His decisions before and after his discharge were within his control. \nThe real issue is what he did when he had additional money. He bought a vehicle \nfinanced through a loan of about $56,321 in July 2021. He could have used some of the \nproceeds from his refinanced mortgage loan to pay, partially pay, or settle the deficiency \nbalances. Instead, he used the proceeds in about March 2022 to pay off about $53,935 \nowed on a loan for the car he purchased the year before. \nApplicant has not paid any of the vehicle accounts, and he does not intend to. He \nsees no financial value in paying for vehicles he does not possess. I am unable to find \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to \npay his debts. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 19, 2023, and the \nhearing was held as scheduled on February 9, 2023. The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s \nexhibit list was marked as HE II. Applicant testified, called one witness, and offered AE A \n(a prior submission in response to a request for information from the DOD CAF), which \nwas admitted without objection, and AE B, as noted above.

As a result of Under Secretary Moultrie\u2019s Memo, Applicant was given the \nopportunity to receive the process set forth in DoD Directive 5220.6, and he elected that \nprocess. (Tr. 5; HE I) \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old technical sergeant in the U.S. Air Force (USAF).

(Tr. 25-28, 31) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties dating back to 2018. Additionally, he \nincurred nine delinquent debts totaling approximately $53,000. Seven of the debts remain \nunpaid. Applicant\u2019s testimony and credit reports establish the debts. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and    \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing. Although he paid one debt \nand he is making payments toward a second debt, he failed to address the remaining \ndebts, which comprise the majority of the overall debt amount. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable. \nApplicant presented evidence that the debts were affected by circumstances \nbeyond his control, namely, separation and divorce. However, he did not act responsibly \nconcerning the debts when he failed to resolve them in a timely fashion. AG \u00b6 20(b), \ntherefore, has some application, but does not fully apply. \nApplicant presented some evidence of financial counseling through an on-base \nagency and his recent engagement of a credit repair law firm. His track record to date \ndoes not support a good financial picture. He has had several years and the assistance \nof a financial counselor to address his debts, but he has largely failed to do so. Based \nupon his past history, there is no reason to believe that he will right his financial ship in \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nthe future. While he did resolve one debt and is working on a second one, these actions \nare too little, too late. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not fully apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies only to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e. Applicant did not \nprovide documentation to support his dispute of SOR \u00b6 1.i. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his two deployments, the \ntestimony of his first sergeant, and his divorce. However, I also considered that he has \nnot adequately addressed his delinquent debt. He has not established a meaningful track \nrecord of debt management, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts \nin the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs: 1.a and 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.b-1.d and 1.f-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr 26-29; GE 1, 4) \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleged the following: (1) that, in March 2017, \nApplicant stuck his hand between a coworker\u2019s legs, grabbed her buttocks, and touched \nher vagina over her uniform; (2) that, in October 2017, Applicant stuck his hand down \nhis coworker\u2019s shirt and squeezed her breast; (3) that, in September 2018, Applicant \nexposed his genitals to a coworker while she was driving Applicant in her vehicle; (4) \nthat, in April 2019, Applicant pulled the waistband of his basketball shorts down and \npulled out his penis in front of his coworker. (SOR) \nOn April 26, 2019, a civilian sexual assault response coordinator (SARC) for the \nNavy notified the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) that the SARC had \nreceived a complaint against Applicant by a female Marine including allegations of \nindecent exposure and unwanted sexual contact. The alleged victim (Sgt X) specifically \nalleged four incidents, occurring in March 2017, October 2017, September 2018, and \nApril 25, 2019 (the incidents that are alleged in the SOR). Applicant admitted in his \nhearing testimony knowing Sgt X and being stationed with her in the past. The NCIS \nconducted an investigation, which concluded with a June 29, 2020 report of \ninvestigation (ROI) that closed out the case at that time. The investigation looked at \npossible violations of Article 120 (Abusive Sexual Contact) and Article 120c (indecent \nexposure) of the UCMJ. (Tr. 32, 39-40; GE 3; HE IV) \nIn the ROI, Sgt X\u2019s four different allegations against Applicant are briefly stated. It \nis unclear from the ROI if those allegations were what was directly stated to the SARC, \nwhich generated the referral to NCIS, or whether Sgt X was separately interviewed by \nthe NCIS investigators. The ROI in evidence does not contain any formal statements by \nSgt X, only the synopsis of information that formed the SOR allegations. The ROI refers \nto exhibits 1-13 contained in earlier interim ROIs, but those were not made a part of the \nROI admitted in this case. Applicant was interviewed by NCIS investigators and denied \nthe first three allegations (March 2017, October 2017 and September 2018), and \nadmitted that his penis was exposed to Sgt X on April 26, 2019, but he asserted that the \nexposure was inadvertent and unintentional. (Tr.33-34; GE 3) \nApplicant was not charged with any offenses under the UCMJ based upon the \nabove allegations. He disclosed that he received a written letter of warning or \ncounseling from his command in February 2020. He was allowed to rebut the \ninformation in the letter and did so. Based upon his rebuttal, the derogatory information \nwas not included in his official records (fitness report). The information also did not \npreclude him from cross-service transferring to the Army in June 2020. (Tr.36-37; GE 3-\n4) \nApplicant\u2019s hearing testimony was consistent with his earlier statement to the \nNCIS and to his background investigator in interviews he had in August and September \n2020. He denied that the first three incidents happened and explained that the fourth \nincident, where his penis was exposed while riding in Sgt X\u2019s car, was inadvertent and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunintentional. Applicant could not state a motive that Sgt X would have to fabricate \nthese allegations against him. He stated that he and Sgt X were both sergeants (E-5s) \nat the time of the alleged incidents, and neither had supervisory authority over the other. \nSgt X did not testify at the hearing and no sworn statements authored by her were \noffered into evidence. (Tr. 33-34, 44-50, 53-56; GE 2-4) \nIn March 2020, Applicant was the subject of a military police incident report \nconcerning an alleged threat to a military member or his dependent (Victims). It is \nunclear from the incident report to whom the alleged threat was directed. This incident is \nwhat formed the basis of the Guideline E allegations that were subsequently withdrawn \nby the Government. I cannot use any evidence associated with this incident as a basis \nfor disqualification; however, I can use it to weigh Applicant\u2019s credibility, in determining \nthe applicability of any mitigating conditions, or in my whole-person assessment. (Tr. \n31-32; GE 2, 4) \nApplicant\u2019s wife and the female-Victim exchanged heated words over the \nsupervision of Applicant\u2019s children, which led to the alleged threat being made. The \nVictims filed a complaint because they claimed Applicant made a threat to grab his gun \nand shoot Victims if they talked to his wife in that manner again. When questioned by \nlaw enforcement, Applicant denied making any threats. There are no sworn statements \nattached to the incident report and the report is heavily redacted. (Tr. 31-32, 52; GE 2, \n4) \nIt appears that the male-Victim made a statement that was summarized in the \nincident report where he described the alleged threat. Witness-1, who is unidentified by \nname or military affiliation, concurred with the male-Victim\u2019s statement and apparently \nprovided both a written and verbal statement. Witness-2, who is identified only as \u201cSGT\u201d \nin the incident report stated he did not hear any verbal exchange. Witness-3, who is \nidentified only as \u201cSGT\u201d in the incident report, stated that she heard Applicant make the \nthreat about shooting one of the Victims. She provided a written and verbal statement. \nNone of these statements were offered into evidence in this hearing. (GE 2) \nApplicant related to his background investigator that two weeks after the incident \ndescribed above, he was informed by his military supervisor that the investigation \nclosed and no disciplinary action against him was forthcoming. He did not face UCMJ \ncharges from this incident. Applicant also told his background investigator that he \nlearned that the female-Victim had stated she had ruined military careers in the past \nand that she was going to file a complaint against Applicant. (GE 4) \nApplicant has had no disciplinary incidents since joining the Army. He offered into \nevidence his Marine Corps fitness reports from June 2016 to March 2020. They reflect \nconsistent performance ranging from a rating of \u201cQualified\u201d to \u201cExceptionally Qualified.\u201d \nHe presented his discharge certificate (DD-214), which reflects his honorable service \nand lists his awards and decoration, including a Navy and Marine Corps Achievement \nMedal; the Combat Action Ribbon; and the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal-two \ndevices, among others. He presented an Army efficiency report for the period of 2020-\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2022, rating him as a top 10% noncommissioned officer (NCO) and highly qualified. He \nalso offered two academic evaluation reports for schools he attended after joining the \nArmy. He excelled in both schools. (AE A) \nApplicant also presented character statements from two Army captains (Capt. C-\n1 and Capt. C-2), his current Army sergeant first class supervisor (SFC S), a Marine \ngunnery sergeant (GySgt S), who was his supervisor while he was still in the Marine \nCorps, and a former Marne sergeant who worked with Applicant and was stationed with \nhim at the time of the sexual conduct allegations and who was present when the alleged \nthreat by Applicant was made (Mr. K). None of these persons testified and were not \nsubject to cross-examination and none expressed knowledge of the underlying facts of \nthe case except Mr. K. I will consider these factors when giving weight to their \nstatements. Their statements are summarized below: \n1. SFC S: He has been Applicant\u2019s supervisor since 2020. He stated that \nApplicant is an excellent soldier, leader, and father. He has integrity and is of stout \ncharacter. (AE B1) \n2. Capt. C-1: He has been Applicant\u2019s commander for the past 11 months. He \ndescribed Applicant as an outstanding NCO. Applicant fully supported the command\u2019s \nsexual harassment/assault response and equal opportunity programs. He has always \nproperly handled classified information. He supports Applicant retaining his security \nclearance. (AE B2) \n3. GySgt S: He was the senior enlisted advisor from April 2019 to September \n2020 at a base where Applicant was stationed. He supervised Applicant for \napproximately 12 months. He stated that Applicant demonstrated a strong work ethic, \nprofessionalism, and leadership. (AE B3) \n4. Capt. C-2: He was Applicant\u2019s commander for approximately two years. He \ndescribed Applicant\u2019s excellent care for the soldiers under his authority during a difficult \nequipment recovery mission. He found Applicant to be professional and someone who \nexercised good judgment. He would trust him with classified information. (AE B4) \n5. Mr. K: He is a former Marine who was stationed with Applicant when the fourth \nincident alleged by Sgt. C occurred. He was also present with Applicant at the event \nwhere the alleged threat was made. Applicant and his family were visiting Mr. K and his \nfamily when the incident occurred. Mr. K admitted that he is a close friend of Applicant. \nHe considers Applicant an outstanding gentleman who would help anyone who needed \nit. Mr. K has no direct knowledge of alleged sexual contact four as described by Sgt. C. \nHe observed that Applicant and Sgt. C had a normal professional relationship. He was \npresent when the dispute happened between Applicant, his wife and a neighbor couple. \nHe did not hear Applicant make a threat that day. He believes it would be out of \ncharacter for him to do so. He told the investigators that he did not hear Applicant make \nany threats.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted;  \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.   \nThis case basically comes down to a question of Applicant\u2019s credibility against \nthe veracity of Sgt. X\u2019s complaints. If Sgt. X\u2019s complaints are believed, Applicant\u2019s \ndenials are not credible. On the other hand, if Applicant\u2019s denials and his claim of an \nunintentional exposing of his penis are credible, then the sexual behavior concerns \nwould not be established. Here are the factors I considered in making this overall \ncredibility-veracity determination: \n1. Sgt X was a non-commissioned officer in the Marine Corps., who would \nsubject herself to discipline for making a false official statement concerning the \nallegations at issue here; \n2. No apparent motive exists for Sgt. X to make false allegations against \nApplicant; \n3. Sgt X did not immediately report the first three incident to her command, a \nSARC representative, or law enforcement. Those incidents allegedly occurred in March \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2017, September 2017, and September 2018. They were not reported until April 2019, \nafter the alleged fourth incident; \n4. If Sgt. X\u2019s version of the facts is believed, then she continued to associate with \nApplicant off duty by providing him rides in her vehicle even though he sexually \nassaulted her, without her consent, on more than one occasion; \n5. The Government did not provide a sworn statement written by Sgt. X. Sgt X \ndid not testify and was not subject to cross-examination; \n6. Applicant testified at his hearing after being advised of the penalties of \nproviding false testimony in accordance with 18 USC \u00a7 1001. He was subject to cross-\nexamination by the Government. His testimony was consistent with earlier statements to \nNCIS investigators and his background investigator; \n7. Applicant has a motive to provide false testimony. That motive is to help \nhimself because his security clearance is at stake;  \n8. In March 2020, Applicant was involved in another dispute where his statement \nconflicted with other witnesses as to whether he made a serious threat to person. The \nVictim and two witnesses claimed Applicant made a serous threat. One witness denied \nwitnessing any interaction, and Applicant denied making a threat. Only summarized, \nredacted statements to military investigators were made part of this record. The \nwitnesses were not identified and any motive for false testimony from them was not \nexplored. One of the supporting witnesses was likely the female-Victim, but she was not \nidentified in the incident report. Applicant told his background investigator that his \ncommand closed the case without disciplinary action imposed against him. There is no \nevidence of any disciplinary action taken against Applicant for this incident.  \nAfter specifically considering the factors outlined above, as well as all the other \nevidence in this case, and after having observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor during his \ntestimony, I have determined that Applicant\u2019s testimony carries more weight than Sgt. \nX\u2019s allegations. As such, I conclude that none of the above disqualifying conditions \napply in this case. Applicant denied the first three allegations, so none of the conditions \nwould apply to them. Applicant admitted that the April 2019 exposure was unintentional \nmaking it non-criminal in nature. There is no high-risk sexual behavior or conduct that \nmakes him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress. Since no disqualifying \nconditions apply, there is no need to address mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice, including his deployments, and his letters of recommendation. I also considered \nthat his command took no UCMJ action against him for the alleged sexual misconduct \nor the alleged threat. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that the security concerns against Applicant were not established by the \nevidence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nFor APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n(The SOR was written in a narrative format.

The SOR is written in narrative format, including one paragraph of factual allegations (Guideline E, \u00b6 1) and one paragraph detailing GA # 1\u2019s conclusions about Applicant\u2019s lack of candor during the investigation and GA # 1\u2019s resulting concerns about his \u201ctrustworthiness, reliability, dependability, discretion and personal conduct.\u201d (Guideline E, \u00b6 2) (The third paragraph under Guideline E erroneously cites and discusses Guideline D, as noted above).

Moss, Esq. \n04/25/2023 \nDecision \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \nThe Government alleged personal conduct security concerns based upon \nApplicant\u2019s alleged correspondence and financial interactions, in about 2014-2016, with \nforeign individuals being investigated by the U.S. government for their alleged involvement \nin child sex trafficking, and upon Applicant\u2019s alleged failure to cooperate with government \ninvestigators interviewing him in 2019 about his purported involvement in that criminal \nconduct. Applicant denied wrongdoing in all respects. This puts the Government to its \nburden to establish by substantial evidence that Applicant is disqualified from eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Based upon my review of the documentary and \ntestimonial record evidence, I conclude that the record evidence submitted in this case is \nnot sufficient for the Government to have established by substantial evidence that \nApplicant was involved in or engaged in the alleged criminal activities being investigated \nby the U.S. Government. The investigation did not lead to criminal charges against \nApplicant. He was interviewed in connection with that criminal investigation, an interview \nconducted by his employer, a U.S. government agency. He initially waived his right not to \n1 \n\n  \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntestify (Garrity rights)1 and spoke freely to the interviewing agents, but then later \nterminated his interview by indicating his intent to seek legal counsel. I conclude that the \nfact that he did so does not establish a failure to cooperate or that he concealed relevant \nand material information, since his denials are not rebutted by contrary evidence. Personal \nConduct security concerns are not established. Moreover, Applicant provided extensive \nwhole-person character evidence, both personally and professionally, regarding his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant\u2019s request for renewed eligibility \nfor access to classified information and a national security sensitive position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on April \n30, 2014. On or about August 8, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued him a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Revoke Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information, Assignment to Duties that have been designated \nNational Security Sensitive, and Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). \nThe LOI included a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that detailed security concerns under \nthe adjudicative guidelines for personal conduct (Guideline E) and financial considerations \n(Guideline F). The DOD CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 12968, \nAccess to Classified Information, dated August 2, 1995; DOD Manual 5200.02, \nProcedures for the DOD Personnel Security Program (PSP), effective on April 3, 2017 \n(DODM 5200.02); Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) Number 704, Personnel \nSecurity Standards And Procedures Governing Eligibility For Access To Sensitive \nCompartmented Information And Other Controlled Access Program Information (October \n1, 2008) and Intelligence Community Policy Guidance (ICPG) 704.3 (Denial or Revocation \nof Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information, Other Controlled Access Program \nInformation, and Appeals Processes (October 2, 2008); and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 15, 2020, with a narrative statement and \n15 enclosures (Ans. Encl. 1-15). (Answer) On or about November 14, 2022, DOD \nConsolidated Adjudication Services revoked his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation and Applicant appealed that denial under the provisions of DODM 5200.02. \nOn December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence & Security) Ronald \nMoultrie issued a memorandum that provided that any individual whose clearance \neligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the date of that \nmemorandum, shall be afforded the opportunity to pursue the DOHA hearing and appeal \nprocess set forth in DOD Directive 5220.6. As a result of Under Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, \nApplicant was given the opportunity to receive the process set forth in DOD Directive \n1 Under Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967), the protection of the individual under the Fifth \nAmendment against coerced statements prohibits the use in subsequent criminal proceedings of statements \nobtained under threat of removal from a job. However, the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit the use of \nthese statements in administrative or civil matters. \n2 \n\n  \n                                             \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5220.6, and he elected that process in a memo dated January 31, 2023. (Tr. 7-9; Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I) \nThe case was assigned to me on February 1, 2023. Applicant\u2019s counsel entered his \nappearance on February 4, 2023. That e-mail, and my February 6, 2023 response, is \nmarked as HE II. In a February 13, 2023 e-mail, Applicant\u2019s counsel sought an order of \nsummary disposition. On February 14, 2023, I responded and indicated that DOD Directive \n5220.6 did not give me that authority. (HE III; Tr. 10-12) On February 28, 2023, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s in-person hearing for March 17, 2023. \nThe \nhearing \nconvened \nas \nscheduled. \nDepartment \nCounsel \nsubmitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3. I grouped GE 3 into four separate exhibits, \nGE 3a through 3d. GE 1, GE 2, and GE 3d were admitted without objection. (Tr. 25-27) \nGE 3a, 3b, and 3c were admitted over Applicant\u2019s objections. (Tr. 25-34) Applicant \nsubmitted five exhibits, marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E. They were \nadmitted without objection. (Tr. 37-41) Applicant testified in person, and four character \nwitnesses testified by phone. At the end of the hearing, I held the record open until April \n4, 2023 to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation. He timely \nsubmitted four documents, his DD-214, a letter from the VA about his disability status, and \ntwo character letters. Those documents are marked as AE F through AE I and admitted \nwithout objection. The record closed on April 6, 2023. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on March 23, 2023. \nAdditional Procedural Rulings \nAt the start of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw the Guideline F \nallegations in the SOR. The motion was granted without objection. (Tr. 14-15) Those \nallegations will not be addressed further, except in relation to Guideline E or the whole-\nperson concept, as necessary. (This also includes the 15 enclosures Applicant included \nwith his SOR response, documents I reviewed but which I will only reference in the Facts \nas necessary). \nWhen Department Counsel rested the Government\u2019s case, Applicant\u2019s counsel \nrenewed his motion for dismissal on the grounds that the Government had not met its \nprima facie case for disqualification under Guideline E. The motion was denied. (Tr. 35-\n37)  \nOne of Applicant\u2019s character witnesses, Mr. D, was his supervisor at another \ngovernment agency (GA # 1). Mr. D. testified by phone (see discussion in the Facts \nsection, below). Present with him on the phone during his testimony was a representative \nfrom the GA # 1 general counsel\u2019s office (GC), who participated in the hearing, without \nobjection, with the limited purpose of advising the court if Mr. D was potentially about to \noffer testimony that was either classified or law enforcement sensitive. (Tr. 62-64) GC \nspoke up on one occasion to object to the speculative nature of a potential answer to one \nquestion. I requested that such an objection come from Department Counsel instead of \nGC, and the testimony continued. (Tr. 77-78) \n3 \n\n  \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring the hearing, upon reviewing the SOR, I called the parties\u2019 attention to the \nfact that the last paragraph under \u201cGuideline E\u201d in the SOR actually cites \u201cGuideline D\u201d for \nsexual behavior. It references several disqualifying conditions under \u201cGuideline D\u201d of DOD \nDirective 5220.6 and concludes, \u201cTherefore, your sexual behavior is a security concern.\u201d \n(SOR, page 2, last paragraph of \u201cGuideline E.\u201d) Department Counsel then confirmed that \nGuideline D had not been alleged in the SOR and was not part of the case. I therefore \nconsider the reference to \u201cGuideline D\u201d in the SOR to be erroneous. (And if it wasn\u2019t, it \nshould have been more clearly and properly alleged). (Tr. 128-130) I will therefore \ndisregard that reference. \nFindings of Fact \nBased on my review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nThe SOR  \nThe Guideline E portion of the SOR chiefly relies on several reports of investigation \n(ROIs) from GA # 1. (GE 3). The SOR is written in narrative format, including one \nparagraph of factual allegations (Guideline E, \u00b6 1) and one paragraph detailing GA # 1\u2019s \nconclusions about Applicant\u2019s lack of candor during the investigation and GA # 1\u2019s \nresulting concerns about his \u201ctrustworthiness, reliability, dependability, discretion and \npersonal conduct.\u201d (Guideline E, \u00b6 2) (The third paragraph under Guideline E erroneously \ncites and discusses Guideline D, as noted above). \nGuideline E, \u00b6 1 of the SOR contains the following allegations, either generally or \nspecifically (with Applicant\u2019s answers, as stated in his SOR Response and his testimony, \nparaphrased in the parentheses, and further addressed below). \n1) Applicant \u201cfailed to report foreign contacts and [failed to] cooperate with [GA # \n1].\u201d (Applicant denies this). (Answer) \n2) During an investigation by a second government agency (GA # 2) into \ninternational child sex trafficking, \u201cyou were identified as possibly being involved \nin the sexual exploitation of minors.\u201d (Applicant denies any such involvement). \n(Answer, \u00b6 1.c) \n3) \u201cYou were identified as sending significant financial transactions via Western \nUnion to an identified individual who is a known/suspected Money Runner in the \nPhilippines who is now incarcerated, but routinely received money for payment \nas a result of live streaming sex shows involving young children.\u201d (Applicant \ndenies any such involvement). \n4) \u201cYou reportedly sent the Western Union transactions prior to being hired by [GA \n# 1]\u201d while on active duty in the Marine Corps in Japan. (Applicant denies this.) \n5) \u201cYour e-mail address [E-mail 1] was used to access child sex performances.\u201d \n(Applicant denies that he ever did so).  \n6) Applicant was asked if he knew any (unidentified) foreign nationals to whom he \n(allegedly) sent money via PayPal or Western Union between 2014 and 2016 \n4 \n\n  \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non several occasions. (Applicant denied knowing these individuals and denied \nsending anyone any money via PayPal or Western Union during this timeframe). \n7) \u201cYou [indicated] that you used various chatrooms to speak to people throughout \nthe world, however you would not provide the names of the chatrooms you \nused.\u201d (Applicant denied using chatrooms, and referenced other social media \nsites) (SOR \u00b6 1.i) \n8) \u201cWhen confronted with information that was known that you sent the \naforementioned individuals money via PayPal, you responded, \u201cOk.\u201d (Applicant \ndenies that this constitutes an admission). (Answer, \u00b6 1.g) \n9) \u201cWhen asked to provide information regarding your financial transactions on \nPayPal/Western Union you refused to provide on [sic] why you sent the money  \n. . .\u201d (Applicant denies that he did this). (Answer, \u00b6 1.h) \n10) \u201c . . . and you terminated the interview by requesting to consult with an attorney.\u201d \n(Applicant admits this conduct but denies that it constitutes a failure to \ncooperate). (Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i) \nApplicant\u2019s Answer: \nIn his Answer, Applicant denied failing to report foreign contacts and failing to \ncomply with the investigation. (Answer, \u00b6 1.b) He noted that the reference to the word \n\u201cpossibly\u201d (in allegation #2, above) shows that \u201cthere is no definitive proof of the alleged \naccusations against him,\u201d with no supporting factual evidence against him.\u201d (Answer, \u00b6 \n1.c) \nApplicant acknowledged receiving Garrity rights and decided, against his attorney\u2019s \nadvice, to waive those rights and agree to be interviewed. Once informed that GA # 1\u2019s \nagents could not access his work computer, he gave them the password so they could do \nso. (Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.j) He said he had a PayPal account that he rarely used, and that his \nex-girlfriend had sometimes used his PayPal account or credit card for online shopping on \nAsian websites. People came to his home and might have had access to his computer. He \ndenied \u201cthat I sent money to individuals that I do not know and never had contact with. \nAlthough they allege that money was transferred from my account, they have not provided \nany evidence that I specifically sent the money, yet they continue to make these \ndefamatory statements.\u201d (Answer, \u00b6 1.d) Applicant asserted that he had been a victim of \nfraud on several occasions. (Answer, \u00b6 1.e) \nApplicant denied sending or receiving any illegal pornographic material. He \nprovided the investigators with his e-mail address (E-mail address 1) and suggested his \ne-mail address had been hacked or compromised. (Answer, \u00b6 1.f) \nApplicant said, \u201cat no time did I intend not to cooperate with the investigation, my \nonly intention was to temporarily halt questioning until I was able to further consult with, \nand have an attorney present when questioning resumed at a later date. (Answer, \u00b6 1.h) \n5 \n\n  \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonal and professional background: \nApplicant is 39 years old. He was married between 2003 and 2008 and has no \nchildren. He has over 100 college credits but has not earned a degree. (Tr. 173) He \nenlisted in the Marine Corps at age 18, in September 2001. He was first trained in aviation \nelectronics and moved to the intelligence field in 2005-2006. He was honorably discharged \nfrom the Marine Corps in June 2015 as a staff sergeant (E-6) (GE 3c at \u00b6 4, GE 1; Tr. 138-\n139, 174-177; AE F, AE G) Applicant documented that he is a disabled veteran, and 100% \nof his disabilities (joints and respiratory problems) are tied to his military service. (Tr. 168-\n169; AE G)  \nAfter the Marine Corps, Applicant held a contractor position with a third government \nagency. He also worked in security for a member of a high-level headquarters. Applicant \nbegan working at GA # 1 in August 2017 as a technical investigator. He held a top-secret \nsecurity clearance with SCI access until it was revoked in November 2022. (GE 3a, \u00b6 3; \nTr. 135-136) \nThe Government\u2019s Documentary Evidence:  \nGA # 1\u2019s ROIs (GE 3a-3.d):  \nGE 3 is comprised of several reports of investigation (ROIs) from GA # 1 regarding \nApplicant, dated June 6, 2018; July 6, 2018; August 1, 2018; and February 13, 2019, \nrespectively. (GE 3a-3d). The ROIs were offered into evidence by Department Counsel \nbut without any underlying documentation of supporting substantive evidence. (Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel objected to admission of some of these documents under the rule of \ncompleteness, Fed. R. Evid. 106. The objection was overruled. (Tr. 25-34).  \nGE 3a states that \u201cthis reactive investigation was initiated pursuant to suspected \nviolations of 18 United States Code (USC) 2252 (Certain Activities Relating to Material \nInvolving the Sexual Exploitation of Minors).\u201d (GE 3a, \u00b6 1) In December 2017, GA # 1 was \ncontacted by the resident agent in charge (RAC) of a GA # 2 office. The RAC reported that \nduring an ongoing international undercover investigation by GA # 2, Applicant was \n\u201cidentified as possibly being involved in the sexual exploitation of minors.\u201d Specifically, he \n\u201cwas identified as sending money through Western Union (WU) to an identified individual \nin the Philippines who routinely received money as a result of live streaming sex shows \ninvolving young children.\u201d Applicant purportedly sent the WU transactions while an active-\nduty Marine stationed in Japan, before he was employed by GA # 1. (GE 3a, \u00b6 2) \nGE 3b (ROI of July 6, 2018) details certain discussions between agents of GA # 1 \nand GA # 2 regarding the investigation. On or about June 27, 2018, a GA # 2 section chief \n(SC) advised that \u201c[GA # 2] never should have passed the information concerning \n[Applicant] to [GA # 1] due to the lack of evidence of any wrongdoing.\u201d The only information \nGA # 2 had concerning Applicant was that \u201che made approximately two payments to an \naccount in the Philippines that was identified as selling live sex shows of minors.\u201d SC \nfurther advised that there was no way to determine why Applicant \u201csent money to the \n6 \n\n  \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccount, nor what, if anything, he purchased with the money.\u201d All that could be confirmed \nwas that Applicant transferred money two times to the account in the Philippines. SC could \nnot provide any dates or other information about the transactions. (GE 3b, \u00b6 2) \nIn July 2018, Applicant was scheduled to fly from the United States to Japan for a \nfriend\u2019s wedding. On or about July 10, 2018, the GA # 1 RA requested that GA 2\u2019s RAC \nprovide Applicant\u2019s phone number for use as a point of contact regarding a search of \nApplicant by agents of GA # 1 upon his return to the U.S. There is a notation that GA # 2 \nshould not have provided GA 1 with Applicant\u2019s name due to the lack of evidence of \nwrongdoing. (GE 3b, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4) \nOn or about July 12, 2018, GA # 2\u2019s case agent for the undercover investigation \nspoke to GA # 1\u2019s RA and expressed concern that GA # 1 wanted to terminate Applicant \nrather than prosecute him. GA # 1\u2019s RA advised that Applicant was the subject of a criminal \ninvestigation. GA # 2\u2019s case agent provided RA with evidence revealing 14 money \ntransactions between September 2014 and June 2016 in which financial accounts \nassociated with Applicant transferred money to individuals known or suspected to be \ninvolved in the online sexual exploitation of children and/or child sex trafficking. (GE 3b, \u00b6 \n5) (That underlying evidence was not offered in this case and is not part of the record \nevidence here. Because it was not offered, Applicant\u2019s efforts, through counsel, to obtain \nrelated underlying documentation from the AGA to use in defending the allegations here \nwere unsuccessful). (AE D)  \nGE 3c (GA # 1\u2019s ROI dated Aug 1, 2018) indicates that by June or July 2028, the \ntwo GAs had agreed to work together in a joint investigation \u201cspecifically targeting\u201d \nApplicant. (GE 3c, \u00b6 3) \nGA # 1 reviewed Applicant\u2019s military record, which referenced charges of misuse of \na government credit card (UCMJ Article 92) and making false statements (UCMJ Article \n107) leading to non-judicial punishment (NJP) (GE 3.c, \u00b6 4) About this, Applicant testified \nthat when he was in the Marine Corps, he was charged or cited for misusing a government \ncredit card when he withdrew money on his government card on one occasion to pay a \ndebt when he had lost his personal credit card and did not have access to a bank. He said \nit was reported to the DOD CAF but no action was taken against his clearance. He received \nnon-judicial punishment (NJP) and was restricted to base for 30 days. Applicant asserted \nthat one of the two charges were dismissed but was not certain which one. (Tr. 136-138, \n178-181) Beyond the reference in GE 3c, there is no corroborating documentation in the \nrecord of these charges, or what resulted.  \nReview of Applicant\u2019s GA # 1 \u201cuser share file\u201d confirmed his home address, cell \nphone number, private e-mail address (E-mail address 1); and his July 2018 trip to Japan \nfor a friend\u2019s wedding, with details of the itinerary.

(GE 3d at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2) \nIn his interview with GA # 1 agents, Applicant asked several questions about the \nfact that he had been searched in July 2018 (at the U.S. airport when he returned from the \nwedding in Japan). He expressed frustration with the fact that the investigation had led to \nhis being sidelined at work and unable to do his job. He was informed that the GA # 1had \nbeen contacted by GA # 2 regarding an ongoing investigation, which resulted in the \ninitiation of an investigation by GA # 1 against him. He was also informed that GA # 1 had \ncustody of his work device, that had been seized by GA # 2, but they had been unable to \naccess the device, since it was passcode-protected.

(The individuals are named in GE 3, but I have used initials here) Applicant denied \nknowing anyone by these names. They asked him if he had ever sent money to named \nindividuals C, A1, or A2, via PayPal, individuals they had reason to believe Applicant had \nsent money to on multiple occasions during 2014 or 2015. Applicant denied doing so. (GE \n3d at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7) (Tr. 153-154) \nApplicant confirmed in the interview with GA # 1 that he used PayPal as an online \nmoney transfer service. He indicated that he had used various \u201cchatrooms\u201d to speak to \npeople around the world, but, according to GE 3d, would not provide the names of the \n\u201cchatrooms\u201d he used. (GE 3d at \u00b6 8)  \nApplicant was then confronted by the investigators about sending these individuals \nmoney via PayPal, Applicant responded, \u201cOK.\u201d When asked why he had sent them money, \nhe refused to answer. (GE 3d at \u00b6 8) The ROI then says, \u201cAs background, [C, A1, and A2] \nare known to be associated with the Online Sexual Exploitation of Children (OSEC).\u201d GE \n3d at \u00b6 8) (This statement in the ROI, allegedly made by an unidentified U.S. government \nagent, is not supported by corroborating testimonial or documentary evidence in the record \nhere). \nApplicant further stated \u201cThat\u2019s not me,\u201d and related further, \u201cI know exactly what \nyour [sic] [Redacted] talking about.\u201d He acknowledged that GA # 1 was in possession of \n8 \n\n  \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPayPal transactions but would not explain why he sent the money.

Applicant said he understood and said he wanted to help the situation. \nHe said he knew what RA was \u201ctrying to do\u201d and said he would recontact RA. Applicant \nsaid he no longer knew how to contact the individuals he was asked about. \u201cAt the \nconclusion of the interview, [Applicant] was turned over to his second-line supervisor.\u201d (GE \n3d at \u00b6 10) There is no further documentary record evidence regarding what, if anything, \nhappened next, or if either Applicant or GA # 1 attempted to re-engage the interview. \nGA # 1\u2019s Security Access Eligibility Report (GE 2):  \nGE 2 is a Security Access Eligibility Report (SAER) from GA # 1 to the DOD CAF \nregarding Applicant, sent under the DOD\u2019s Continuous Evaluation Program, which \nrequires commands to promptly report security-significant information for individuals \nindoctrinated into SCI access. The basis for the report regarding Applicant was his alleged \nfailure to report foreign contacts and to cooperate with the investigation. (GE 2) \nSpecifically, GE 2 noted that Applicant was identified in GA # 2\u2019s investigation \nregarding ongoing sexual exploitation of minors in the Philippines. He was \u201cpossibly \ninvolved\u201d in activities including sending money to foreign nationals identified as providing \ninternet access to sites that live-stream sex shows involving young children. When \ninterviewed during the investigation by GA # 1, Applicant was asked to provide information \nregarding his financial transactions on PayPal and WU. Applicant refused to provide an \nexplanation of why he sent the money and terminated the interview by requesting to \nconsult with an attorney.

Absent full \ncooperation, [GA # 1] has a serious concern about his trustworthiness, \nreliability, dependability, discretion, and personal conduct. (GE 2 at 4) \nThe SAER memo noted that \u201cformal prosecution is not being pursued at this time\u201d \nbut that Applicant \u201cremains a prosecutorial person of interest in an ongoing investigation.\u201d \nGA # 1 has suspended the Inspector General\u2019s investigation. GA # 1 also suspended \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information for cause and placed him on indefinite \nsuspension. GA # 1 \u201ccannot favorably recommend eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d (GE 2 at 4) \nAs noted above. the Government\u2019s case did not include any underling substantive \nevidence from the investigations by either GA # 1 or GA # 2.

He testified that, during 2014 to 2016, he did \nnot send money to any foreign national, via PayPal, WU, or otherwise, for the exploitation \nof children, nor did he access live or virtual child sex performances. He denied any sexual \ninterest in anyone underage and he pronounced it \u201cdisgusting.\u201d (Tr. 145-146) \nApplicant was once placed into police custody in Japan on suspicion of drunk \ndriving, but no alcohol was found in his system and no charges were filed. (Tr. 146-147) \nOtherwise, Applicant has never been charged with a crime, beyond his military NJP issues. \n(Tr, 147, 162, 227) \nApplicant remains employed at GA # 1 and has been on unpaid administrative leave \nsince about March 2019. He was recently approved for secondary employment and has \nheld a job since about September or October 2022 in an uncleared position outside of \ngovernment contracting. He earns an annual salary of about $115,000. (Tr. 131-133, 227-\n229) \nApplicant said he learned of the investigation when he was stopped by government \ninvestigators while deplaning in the U.S. after returning from the wedding in Japan, in the \nsummer of 2018. They asked for his passport, said it was a random check, and asked \nthem to follow him. They then confiscated his electronics (work computer, personal \ncomputer and a personal cell phone) and asked for his computer passwords. He said he \nwas told if he did not comply he could be fired, so he did so. (Tr. 139-141, 188) This was \nthe same computer he had in 2014-2016. (Tr. 188) When his items were seized, he \nreported the matter to his direct supervisor, Mr. D. (Tr. 142) (See Mr. D\u2019s testimony, below) \nApplicant\u2019s personal computer and phone were returned to him about two months \nlater. (Tr. 142) He was never told what was found on them, and he asserted he was not \ntold why his equipment was seized. He asserted he was not told of any investigation into \nhim personally. (Tr. 144) He was allowed to return to work, with full access to government \ncomputers, until he was placed on administrative leave, about eight months later. (Tr. 143) \nApplicant was interviewed by GA # 1 in 2019. He was brought to the interview by \nhis program manager, because he had an injury at the time that affected his mobility. (Ans. \nEncl. 7). He was advised of his \u201cGarrity rights.\u201d He was asked to waive those rights in \nwriting, and said if he did not do so, he would be terminated. As a result, he signed the \nwaiver. (Tr. 147-148) (The waiver is not in evidence here, nor the specific wording of the \n\u201cGarrity warning\u201d he received). \n10 \n\n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed once, by two agents from GA # 1. This was the first time \nhe was aware of the specific nature of the investigation. (Tr. 184-186) The agents asked \nabout the incident when his electronics were taken from him. He was informed that GA # \n1 had been in possession of his government computer for some time, but they were not \nable to access it because it was password protected. Applicant gave them the password \nand they gained access to the computer. (Tr. 148) \nApplicant said he was asked about foreign contacts from years before, foreign \ntravel, and individuals he did not know. He was asked about some e-mails, some of which \nwere his and some which were not. They asked again about the individuals he did not \nknow. When he denied knowing those people, GA # 1\u2019s agents called him a liar. (Tr. 149) \nApplicant said the GA # 1 agents accused him of sending money via PayPal and \nWU from his accounts. Applicant said, \u201cOkay,\u201d by which he said he meant, \u201cOkay, what\u2019s \nyour point. I don\u2019t know these individuals. I didn\u2019t send this money.\u201d (Tr. 149) (See also \nSOR Response at \u00b6 1.g, in which Applicant further explained his mindset: \u201cOK, and?\u201d, or \n\u201cso what,\u201d as in \u201cOK. I understand what you are saying, and that still does not change the \nfact that I do not know these people.\u201d) Applicant asserted (to the agents) that he had \u201cdone \nnothing but comply.\u201d He had given them his personal and work computers and cell phones, \nphone contacts, e-mails, e-mail contacts, messages, WhatsApp and messages, and \u201call \nmy social media\u201d contacts and messages. (Tr. 149-150) \nFeeling threatened with potential termination and being called a liar to his face, \nApplicant said he \u201cfelt like I needed somebody in the room to observe.\u201d His program \nmanager was not allowed to be present. He did not believe he was under criminal \ninvestigation, but rather administrative questioning \u201cto get to the bottom of something.\u201d (Tr. \n151) He did not respond to the agent\u2019s questions about what social media websites he \nused because he was frustrated, felt threatened, had been called a liar, and wanted an \nobserver present because \u201cit was just a contentious situation.\u201d (Tr. 206) He said the \ninvestigators were yelling at him during the interview. (Tr. 211) \nApplicant denied that he was informed of his Garrity rights because he was under \ncriminal investigation. He said he waived his Garrity rights because he was told he would \nbe asked questions about why his personal electronics and government computer were \ntaken from him. At some point, he said, the agents informed him he was a suspect or \nperson of interest. (Tr. 212-213) \nWhen asked during his hearing why he did not provide an explanation to the agents \nabout why he had sent money using a PayPal account, Applicant said, \u201cI cannot provide \ninformation on something I did not do.\u201d (Tr. 218-219, 225) He denied saying in the interview \nthat he no longer knew how to contact the individuals he was asked about. He said, \u201cI \nemphatically denied knowing those individuals.\u201d (Tr. 219) \nApplicant denied terminating the interview. He said (apparently repeatedly) that he \nwanted a \u201cthird party\u201d present. \u201cAt no time did I say I would not comply.\u201d (Tr. 151) He said \nthat at the end, he was told that the agents \u201cwould be in town for two more days, and that \n11 \n\n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI could have my lawyer get in touch with them.\u201d (Tr. 151) He asserted that he called and \nmessaged them not the next day but the day after that, and had his lawyer call them, with \nno response. (Tr. 151) \nApplicant noted in his SOR response that he consulted with an attorney and was \ntold not to agree to be interviewed. (Tr. 187; SOR Answer) He agreed to the interview \nbecause he was told he would be terminated if he refused. (Tr. 187-188) \nApplicant testified that \u201cthe interview ended with the agents telling me that they have \ntwo more days in [city S] and to have my lawyer contact them.\u201d He said \u201cI had a lawyer at \nthe time. I was having trouble contacting him the following day. . . . My lawyer attempted \nto contact them and from what they tell me, they were ignored.\u201d He was unable to recall \nthe name of his lawyer, or the names of the agents. He also said he texted the agents from \nhis government cell phone. He said they responded and said they were going to return to \nWashington, D.C. GA # 1\u2019s agents did not contact him again. (Tr. 225-227) He did not \nprovide any documentation regarding his retention or use of a lawyer or any \ncommunication between himself and a lawyer, such as a retainer letter or other \ncorrespondence, either before or after his interview with GA # 1, to corroborate these \nassertions. \nApplicant said he opened a PayPal account in 2015, not in 2014, as referenced in \nGE 3d. He said he used E-Mail 1 to do so, not E-mail 2. He has had only one PayPal \naccount. (Tr. 154-155, 199-200; AE C) Applicant denied having a WU account between \n2014 and 2016. (Tr. 155) Applicant provided documentation showing that he has been a \nmember of WU since April 2018. (AE B) His personal information with both PayPal and \nWU includes E-mail account 1. (AE B, AE C) \nApplicant said he had one bank account, with a military credit union, as well as a \ncredit card with that institution. He no longer has access to the bank account statements \nor the credit card statements from that time, but for 2016. (Tr. 156-158, 202-203) He \nprovided more recent credit card statements, from 2016. (AE E) He also banks with \nanother institution that caters to the military community. (Tr. 202) \nApplicant denied that he was ever presented with documentation from GA # 1 about \nhis PayPal or WU financial transactions or related e-mail or phone contacts he allegedly \nused. (Tr. 155-156) He has never been contacted by the Justice Department or told that \nhe was the subject or target of a criminal investigation. (Tr. 162) \nApplicant was unable to cite to any fraudulent purchases or transactions that he \nwas impacted by from 2014-2016. He acknowledged that references to such transactions \nin his Answer to the SOR were based on speculation. (Tr. 157-158, 161, 195-196) \nApplicant did not recall taking action to inquire if his e-mail or computers had been hacked. \n(Tr. 193-195) He did not share his passwords with others and did not recall anyone else \nusing his e-mail or computer at home between 2014-2016.

He still has access to those social medial accounts. He denied any unreported \nforeign contacts from social media platforms. (Tr. 163, 192-193) Applicant defined \u201clive-\nstreaming\u201d as \u201cthese vloggers that go around showing their life. I don\u2019t do that. No.\u201d None \nof his social media interactions involved that activity. (Tr. 208-209) \nWhen he was in Japan, Applicant was dating someone. She was of legal age, about \na year and a half older than he was. (Tr. 158-159) All of his roommates there were U.S. \ncitizens and none were engaged in criminal conduct. Some of them occasionally would \nhave had access to his personal computer, but he never observed anyone engaged in \nunusual or concerning computer conduct, or unauthorized financial transactions. (Tr. 163-\n164) After returning to the United States, Applicant occasionally allowed his then girlfriend \nto use his credit card, but only with \u201cexpress permission.\u201d He does not recall her ever \nmaking unauthorized purchases or engaging in any criminal behavior. (Tr. 165-166) He \nsaid she also used his PayPal account. (Tr. 200-201) She did not have access to his \ncomputer passwords. (Tr. 205) \nApplicant testified that the clearance revocation process has had a significant \nfinancial impact on him. He fell behind on his accounts (as evidenced, perhaps, by the \nnow-withdrawn Guideline F case) and wondered how he would get by. He sought \npermission from GA # 1 to pursue a second job and heard no response for two years. He \nis grateful to his friend, Mr. E (Character Witness 3, below) for giving him a place to live \nand for the help of his brother (Character Witness 4, below). (Tr. 166-168) \nThe SOR alleges, in part, that Applicant was identified as sending significant \nfinancial transactions via WU to an identified individual, a suspected money runner in the \nPhilippines, now incarcerated, who routinely received money for payments for live-\nstreaming sex shows involving young children. (SOR, \u00b6 1). (The purportedly \u201cidentified \nindividual\u201d is not identified in the SOR). Applicant said, \u201cI\u2019ve never done those things and \nI\u2019ve received no evidence whatsoever of me doing those things.\u201d (Tr. 220-221). He denied \nmaking a financial transaction by WU or any other means to someone he knew to be \ninvolved in live-streaming sex shows involving young children, in the Philippines or \nanywhere else, prior to joining NCIS or at any other time. (Tr. 221-222) \nApplicant denied that an e-mail address account of his (E-Mail 1) was used to \naccess child sex performances. (Tr. 222-223) The SOR alleged that Applicant knew \nforeign nationals \u201cby the name of whom you sent money to via PayPal on two separate \noccasions in 2016.\u201d [sic \u2013 no name is referenced after the phrase \u201cby the name of . . .\u201d] \n\u201cYou denied knowing anyone by that name.\u201d (SOR, \u00b6 1) Applicant denied sending money \nto any foreign nationals via PayPal in 2016. (Tr. 223) He denied sending money to any \n(also unidentified) foreign nationals seven times by PayPal in 2014, as alleged. (Tr. 223-\n224) He denied sending money to a third (unidentified) foreign national four times via \nPayPal in 2014. (Tr. 224) Applicant denied declining to provide identifying information \nabout chatrooms he used, because he did not use chatrooms. (Tr. 224-225) (The \n13 \n\n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstatements in the SOR allege that Applicant sent money to these unidentified individuals. \nThe SOR notes that Applicant repeatedly denied knowing them.

(SOR \u00b6 1)  \nApplicant testified on re-direct that investigators from GA # 2 had access to his cell \nphone, and his social media accounts were not password protected on his cell phone. No \none from either GA # 1 or GA # 2 ever told him there was anything of concern in his social \nmedia accounts. (Tr. 229-230) He said he provided GA # 2\u2019s agents with passwords for \nhis social media accounts and messages and provided names of the websites he \naccessed to GA# 1 investigators by providing his passwords. (Tr. 231-232) \nApplicant said he might have accessed a \u201cchatroom\u201d-type of website for accessing \na publicly available \u201ctech blog\u201d forum for a \u201ccomputer or server question\u201d but \u201cnot regularly.\u201d \n(Tr. 230) He has never accessed the \u201cdark web\u201d in his personal capacity.

(Tr. 230-231) \nCharacter evidence:  \nCharacter witness 1, Mr. L, served in the Marine Corps from 1995-2017 before \nretiring as a gunnery sergeant (E-7). He then worked for the U.S. Government and is now \nemployed with a government contractor in the intelligence field. He has held a high-level \nclearance for many years. Mr. L first met Applicant in 2007 when Applicant applied to join \nthe counter-intelligence field in the Marine Corps. Mr. L was his direct enlisted supervisor \nin that unit for about two years (2009-2011). Mr. L regards Applicant as a \u201cgreat team \nleader\u201d and a \u201cvery dynamic thinker.\u201d Mr. L was not aware of any misconduct by Applicant. \n(Tr. 44-49, 55) \nMr. L did not serve with Applicant during 2014-2016. He has never had access to \nApplicant\u2019s personal computer. He has had training regarding keeping his personal \ncomputer information secure. (Tr. 55-56) \nMr. L and Applicant remain personal and family friends. They have intermittent \ncontact about once a month by phone or text. Mr. L has observed no unusual interaction \nwith foreign nationals and Applicant. He is aware of the SOR allegations. He said Applicant \nwas \u201cas shocked as I am about it\u201d and understands that Applicant denies the allegations \n\u201cemphatically.\u201d (Tr. 51, 52, 59) Mr. L is not aware of Applicant ever paying to access child \nsex performances and has no reason to believe he would do so. Applicant is a person of \n\u201chigh character\u201d who has \u201calways been great around my family, my children.\u201d (Tr. 52-53) \nHe has not known Applicant to show interest in dating anyone underage.

He then worked for another government agency (AGA) as a contractor and has \nworked for GA # 1 since 2014. He has held a clearance for many years. Mr. D first met \nApplicant in the Marine Corps in about 2008, when Applicant was a student of his in a \ncounter-intelligence course. He described Applicant as a \u201cvery good student.\u201d (Tr. 65-68) \nHe had no interaction with Applicant between 2014-2016. (Tr. 85) \nIn 2017, Mr. D hired Applicant to work for him in counterintelligence at GA # 1. \nApplicant was his \u201cnumber one pick.\u201d (Tr. 69) Mr. D was Applicant\u2019s first-line supervisor \nand then his second-line supervisor after Applicant was placed on administrative leave in \nabout October 2021. Mr. D always rated Applicant as one of the \u201ctop three\u201d investigators \nin the office. (Tr. 71-72) \nBeyond the issues in the SOR, Mr. D is not aware that Applicant had unusual or \nconcerning interactions with foreign nationals. Applicant had access to government \ncomputers, all subject to routine monitoring. He was not aware of the discovery of illegal \nmaterials relating to Applicant. (Tr. 72-75) Mr. D said Applicant contacted him when GA # \n2 confiscated his personal belongings at the airport. (Tr. 90-91) \nMr. D is aware of the issues in the SOR and provided a supporting letter as well as \nhearing testimony. That statement was cleared by GA # 1 authorities. (Tr. 75-80; Ans. Enc. \n1) Mr. spoke to Applicant about the allegations and related that Applicant told him his \npersonal information was stolen on multiple occasions, that they were not his accounts. \nApplicant would not have made the payments, and that he did not have the accounts \nduring the timeframe alleged. Applicant told Mr. D he was \u201cexplicitly denying making those \ntransactions\u201d and was denying having access to child sex performances. (Tr. 81) \nApplicant was never cited for security violations or infractions, or any employee \nmisconduct when working with Mr. D. Mr. D was not aware of any unusual or concerning \ninteractions with foreign nationals, sexual misconduct, illicit or illegal conduct. (Tr. 81-82) \nMr. D. checked in with Applicant by e-mail about once a week once Applicant was placed \non administrative leave. (Tr. 82, 91) Applicant is still on administrative leave from GA # 1. \n(Tr. 92) \nMr. D has observed no conduct and heard no statements by Applicant causing \ndoubts raising concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, trustworthiness, or willingness to \ncomply with the law. (Tr. 83, 87) He has no reason to believe that Applicant engaged in \nthe conduct alleged, or would engage in the sexual exploitation of minors.

Mr. E is a personal friend of Applicant\u2019s and has also been his \nlandlord for about the last two years.

Mr. E regards them as \u201cabsolutely impossible.\u201d If he felt otherwise, \nhe would not allow Applicant around his children and family. He has no concerns about \nApplicant working for the government in position of trust or in a cleared environment. Mr. \nE did not visit Applicant in Japan during 2014-2016. He has never had access to \nApplicant\u2019s personal computer. (Tr. 105-107)  \nCharacter witness 4 is Applicant\u2019s older brother, B. B is employed by a state \nuniversity.

B and Applicant are \u201cvery close\u201d and talk often, \nseveral times a week. B has never had cause to question Applicant\u2019s judgment or to work \nin a cleared environment. (Tr. 112-119, 123-124) \nB said Applicant has had two serious relationships. Applicant has never dated or \nbeen interested in someone underage. He has never known Applicant to view or access \nchild sex performances or send money to those involved in the exploitation of children. B \nhas reviewed the SOR and is aware of the allegations. He said Applicant was \u201csurprised \nand shocked\u201d by the allegations and that \u201che didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Applicant has never been \ncharged with a crime. (Tr. 117-121, 126-127) Since Applicant\u2019s suspension from his job, \nhe has been out of work and under some financial strain. He had to sell his home.

He provided a letter expressing similar sentiments as Ms. L, and \nstrongly endorses reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance. (AE I) \nPolicies \nAs the U.S. Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, \n528 (1988), it is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. Security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. 484 U.S. at 531. The \nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment \nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination whether the person is eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The adjudicative process is an evaluation of the whole person. It \nrecognizes that we should view persons by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations, \nand a number of other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking \ninto consideration all relevant evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, and applying \nsound judgment, common sense, and careful analysis. \nThe standard for security clearance decisions is whether granting or continuing \neligibility for a clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. In all \nadjudications, the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. \nTherefore, any doubt concerning a person being considered for access to classified \ninformation must be resolved in favor of national security. \nBurden of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See \nalso Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a \n17 \n\n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nThe Government has the burden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. Department Counsel is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to establish the facts alleged in the SOR that have been \ncontroverted.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E \u00b6 1 of the SOR is broken down into 10 separate allegations. (See Items \n#1 through # 10, at the beginning of the Facts section, above). Before addressing \napplication of Guideline E disqualifying or mitigating conditions to these allegations, it must \nbe established whether there is record evidence to support them as a factual matter, let \nalone whether they establish disqualifying conduct, mitigated or otherwise. So I turn to that \nfirst. \nSOR allegations #2 through #5 concern Applicant\u2019s alleged contacts and financial \ninteractions with unidentified foreign individuals allegedly involved in child sex trafficking \nand the sexual exploitation of minors. Applicant denies these allegations in all respects. \nThis means the Government has the burden of proving those allegations by substantial \nevidence. The Government has not met its burden as to those allegations. I note, in \nparticular, that SOR allegation # 5 (\u201cYour e-mail address [E-mail 1] was used to access \nchild sex performances.\u201d) has no support in the record evidence in this case at all. \nSimilarly, there is no record evidence, let alone substantial evidence, in this case, to \nsupport that Applicant engaged in any contact, conduct, or financial transactions with any \nforeign (or other) individuals (named or otherwise) involved in such conduct. \nSome of those allegations (SOR allegations #2 through # 4) note that Applicant was \nidentified in investigations by GA # 1 and/or GA # 2 as being involved in, or even \u201cpossibly\u201d \ninvolved in transactions with foreign individuals involved in child sex trafficking. This may \nbe true, but it is not established by substantial evidence in this case, without supporting \ncorroborating evidence beyond GE 3, the GA # 1 ROIs. In particular, I note that Applicant \nwas not only not charged with a crime, by the end of the ROIs, he was no longer \n18 \n\n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nconsidered a suspect, only a person of interest. SOR allegations # 2, # 3 (further \ndiscussion below) and # 4 are not established by substantial evidence. \nThe remaining allegations chiefly concern Applicant\u2019s alleged failure to cooperate \nwith the investigations. Among these are allegations that Applicant failed to report foreign \ncontacts during the GA # 1 investigation (SOR allegation #1 (in part) and allegations # 3 \nand 6) \nThese allegations are not established. Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend in Japan was a \nforeign contact \u2013 but Applicant identified her. He denied knowing or interacting with the \nforeign individuals allegedly involved in child sex trafficking (not identified in the SOR at \nall, and who are identified in the GA # 1 ROIs as individuals I refer to here as C, A1, and \nA2). Applicant denied any knowledge of these individuals and there is no record evidence, \nlet alone substantial evidence in the record here, to disprove his denials. SOR allegations \n# 1 (in part), # 3, and # 6 are not established by substantial evidence.  \nSimilarly, SOR allegation # 8 is not established. Applicant was apparently asked \nabout these individuals, but the allegation that it was \u201cknown that you sent the \naforementioned individuals money via PayPal\u201d is not established, nor did Applicant admit \nthis by saying \u201cOK.\u201d SOR allegation # 8 is not established by substantial evidence in the \nrecord here. \nSOR allegation # 9 states, \u201cWhen asked to provide information regarding your \nfinancial transactions on PayPal/Western Union you refused to provide on [sic] why you \nsent the money\u2026\u201d This allegation is based on a faulty premise, since it was not established \nthat Applicant DID send money, via PayPal, Western Union, or any other mechanism to \nforeign individuals, whether related to the investigations by GA # 1 or GA # 2 or otherwise. \nApplicant denied the allegation (as he did in the interview) and there is no record evidence \nto rebut his denial. SOR allegation # 9 is not established by substantial evidence. \nSOR allegation # 7 concerns the reference to \u201cchatrooms\u201d in GE 3 and Applicant\u2019s \nalleged failure to disclose the names of chatrooms he used. GE 3 does reference \nchatrooms, but Applicant denied using any chatrooms (beyond chatrooms regarding \ncomputer technology), and said instead that he meant other social media outlets such as \nFacebook and WhatsApp. Facebook and WhatsApp are not mentioned in GE 3, but there \nis no other evidence to rebut Applicant\u2019s statement that he does not use chatrooms. Since \nthere is no other evidence that he uses (or used) chatrooms, his alleged \u201cfailure\u201d to provide \nthe names of chatrooms (where he might have interacted with foreign individuals) is not \nestablished, either as a factual matter, or as a failure to cooperate. SOR allegation # 7 is \nnot established by substantial evidence. \n(To the extent that there are any SOR allegations regarding \u201cfailure to cooperate\u201d \nduring the investigations by GA # 1 or GA # 2 because Applicant \u201cfailed to provide his \ncomputer passwords,\u201d, this is not established \u2013 Applicant provided his passwords when \nasked, and they worked). \n19 \n\n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThis leaves SOR allegation # 10, regarding the end of the interview, and the general \n\u201cfailure to cooperate\u201d with GA # 1, set forth in the rest of SOR allegation # 1). As a factual \nmatter, the record evidence establishes that Applicant terminated the interview with GA # \n1 when he requested to seek legal counsel. SOR allegation # 10 is established. Whether \nthis constituted \u201cfailure to cooperate\u201d (SOR allegation # 1) is a legal question requiring \nexamination of the Guideline E general security concern and the Guideline E disqualifying \nconditions (AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16).  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative proceedings. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nApplicant, himself an employee of GA # 1, was interviewed in February 2019 by GA \n# 1 agents. He initially waived his Garrity rights and agreed to participate. However, he \nultimately terminated the interview, and indicated that he wished to consult legal counsel. \nThe interview was not in connection with a personnel security determination, but rather \nwas conducted pursuant to his suspected violations of 18 USC 2252 (Certain Activities \nRelating to Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of Minors).\u201d (GE 3a, \u00b6 1) \nApplicant\u2019s interview was not in connection with a personnel security determination. \nThus, whether or not Applicant\u2019s request to consult legal counsel constituted \u201creasonable \ncause\u201d to terminate the interview, and thereby led him to cease \u201cto undergo or cooperate,\u201d \nwith the interview process, AG \u00b6 15(a) does not apply. \nIn terminating the interview by invoking his right to counsel, Applicant engaged in a \n\u201crefusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators. \n20 \n\n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, however, since the investigators were involved in a criminal investigation, and \nnot a personnel security determination, AG \u00b6 15(b) also does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing;  \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant denied engaging with or sending money to foreign nationals purportedly \ninvolved in the sexual exploitation of children. His denials of that conduct are unrebutted \nby substantial evidence that he engaged in that conduct. If it were shown otherwise, AG \u00b6 \n16(e) would unquestionably apply. But that showing is not met here, so AG \u00b6 16(e) is not \nestablished. \nAs noted above, it is not established by substantial evidence here that Applicant \nengaged in \u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity.\u201d He was investigated for \nviolation of 18 USC 2252, but was not charged with any crime, though he remained a \nperson of interest. AG \u00b6 16(g) is not established.  \nThe GA # 1 interviewers were investigators and security officials (with \nApplicant\u2019s own employer). Applicant terminated the interview and requested to consult \nlegal counsel. He did not, however, deliberately provide false or misleading information, \nnor did he conceal or omit information, concerning relevant facts, to his employer, an \n21 \n\n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvestigator, security official, or other official government representative.

However, \nthis did not constitute a \u201cviolation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(f) does not apply. \nThis leaves AG \u00b6 16(c), if for no other reason than it is the \u201ccatch-all\u201d disqualifying \ncondition that should be examined when potentially disqualifying conduct doesn\u2019t fit \nsquarely anywhere else in the Guideline E disqualifying conditions. \nAccording to GE3d, the GA # 1 agent reiterated to Applicant that he could recontact \nGA # 1 after consulting with an attorney. Applicant says he was told that GA # 1\u2019s agents \nwould be in town for two more days and that his attorney could contact them. Applicant \nasserted that he called and messaged them not the next day but the day after that, and \nhad his lawyer call them, with no response. He was unable to recall the name of his lawyer, \nand produced no corroborating documentation, either that he had retained a lawyer, or \nthat said lawyer had reached out to the GA # 1 agents to re-engage (or that Applicant had \ndone so himself). However, there is also no evidence in the record that GA# 1\u2019s agents \naffirmatively sought to re-establish contact with Applicant, without success. \nWhat happened after Applicant terminated the interview to consult legal counsel, \nthen, is not only unclear, it is almost non-existent. It is therefore rather difficult on the record \nbefore me to make an affirmative finding that Applicant\u2019s actions constituted a failure to \ncooperate, and thus, a security concern (particularly concerning an interview relating to a \ncriminal investigation that did not lead to criminal charges (or any evidence, documented \nor otherwise, even in this administrative forum, of criminal conduct. I recognize that \nApplicants typically have a duty to cooperate fully with the security process, even if they \nconsul legal counsel. (See, e.g., mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(b)). But it is not clear that \nwhat Applicant did here, in exercising his constitutional right to consult legal counsel in a \ncriminal investigation (particularly under likely threat of losing his job) constituted security-\nsignificant disqualifying conduct. I cannot find that AG \u00b6 16(c), or any other disqualifying \ncondition, applies. \nSince I conclude that no Guideline E disqualifying conditions apply, I need not \naddress application of any mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Analysis  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. An administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n22 \n\n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nAs noted at length above, I found that 9 of the 10 possible factual Guideline E \nallegations in the SOR are not established by the record. No criminal charges resulted, \nnor were any suggested by the record evidence in the administrative forum here. Applicant \nstrenuously and consistently denied all allegations of criminal misconduct. His denials are \nalso unrebutted by substantial contrary record evidence. \nThe 10th  factual allegation, Applicant\u2019s termination of the NCIS interview, was \nestablished as a factual matter, but its circumstances, involving his request to consult legal \ncounsel in a criminal case (particularly one that did not lead to criminal charges) did not \nestablish a Guideline E security concern, particularly given consideration of all of the \nrecord evidence here, including Applicant\u2019s testimony and the rest of his case.  \nIt does appear that GA # 1 \u201cmoved the goalposts\u201d on the Applicant here, since, \nalthough criminal prosecution was not being pursued against him, and they seem to have \ntaken no action to suspend or terminate his employment on the basis of the criminal \ninvestigation, they nonetheless suspended his clearance, and did so for cause, having \nconcluded that he failed to fully cooperate. \nIn weighing the whole-person evidence, I credit and acknowledge the testimony of \nApplicant\u2019s character witnesses, all of whom attested to his integrity, work ethic, \nprofessionalism, judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability, both professionally and \npersonally. In particular, I note that several witnesses (both in testimony and letters) \nspecifically noted that they regard him as a member of the family and trust him to be around \ntheir children. I also credit Applicant\u2019s long and honorable service in the Marine Corps and \nas an GA # 1 employee. And I note that the allegations are not only unsubstantiated, they \nare also now quite dated, as they concern alleged (but unproven) criminal conduct from \n2014-2016 (seven to nine years ago) and an interview from 2019. I also note that \nApplicant\u2019s most recent completed security clearance background investigation stems \nfrom a 2014 SCA, now nine years on. \nFor these reasons, I conclude that personal conduct security concerns are not \nestablished. Overall, the record evidence therefore leaves me with no questions or doubts \n23 \n\n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, including, as appropriate, \nSCI, and assignment to national security sensitive duties.  \nFormal Findings \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct:  \nFor Applicant \nAllegations 1-10: \nFor Applicant \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information, and a \nnational security sensitive position is granted. \nDOHA administrative judges currently do not have authority to grant eligibility for \naccess to SCI. The continuation of Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \nis authorized by the Moultrie memorandum, but the Moultrie memorandum did not confer \nauthority to DOHA to grant SCI eligibility. With the grant of top-secret eligibility in this \ndecision, it is now possible for an appropriate authority to grant Applicant SCI eligibility, \nbased on the security clearance granted here, if they so chose. \nBraden M.

(Answer) On December 2, 2022, \nUnder Secretary of Defense (Intelligence & Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a \nmemorandum that provided that any individual whose clearance eligibility was revoked or \ndenied between September 30, 2022, and the date of that memorandum, shall be afforded \nthe opportunity to pursue the DOHA hearing and appeal process set forth in DOD Directive \n5220.6. On November 22, 2022, DOD Consolidated Adjudication Services denied \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information and Applicant appealed that denial \nunder the provisions of DODM 5200.02. As a result of Under Secretary Moultrie\u2019s Memo, \nApplicant was given the opportunity to receive the process set forth in DOD Directive \n5220.6, and he elected that process. (Tr. 9-10; Hearing Exhibit (HE) I) \nThe case was assigned to me on January 18, 2023. On January 27, 2023, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s hearing for February 14, 2023, via video-\nteleconference. \nThe \nhearing \nconvened \nas \nscheduled. \nDepartment \nCounsel \nsubmitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7.

At the end of the hearing, I held the record open until February 24, \n2023, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation. He timely \nsubmitted two documents, a letter from his psychologist, and a letter from his wife. Those \ndocuments are marked as AE B and AE C and admitted without objection. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 24, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nBased on my review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 55 years old. He has been married and divorced three times. He and \nhis fourth wife have been married since April 2017. He has two grown children and three \nadult stepchildren.

He \nwas advised not to consume drugs or alcohol in combination with his bipolar medication. \n(Tr. 25-26, 45-49, 53-54; GE 7) \nThe DOD CAF requested in June 2020 that Applicant participate in a DOD-\nsanctioned medical evaluation, which he did, on December 20, 2021. (GE 7) Records from \nApplicant\u2019s prior hospitalizations and treatments at the VA facilities were apparently \nreviewed by the evaluators, as they are referenced in the medical evaluation at some \nlength. (GE 7) However, those underlying records are not part of the evidence in this case. \nThus, it is difficult to determine with certainty what those records reflect in terms of specific \nrecommendations for Applicant. \nThe DOD evaluators, a psychology intern, and a Ph.D. clinical psychologist, \ndiagnosed Applicant with alcohol dependence, in partial remission, but also found that he \nnonetheless continued drinking. The evaluators found that at times Applicant drank too \nmuch, suggesting that he was struggling to manage his addiction. (GE 7) (SOR, Guidelines \nG, I) \nThe DOD evaluators also diagnosed Applicant with cannabis dependence and \ncocaine dependence, both uncomplicated, in partial remission. The evaluators noted that \nApplicant continued to use marijuana but denied using cocaine after his 2016 treatment. \n(GE 7) (SOR, Guidelines H, I) \nThe December 2021 medical evaluation shows that currently and by history \nApplicant has a history of bipolar disorder, resulting in several hospitalizations, most \nrecently in October 2020, after he discontinued his medications and entered a manic \nperiod. Noncompliance with medication is indicated. Future manic episodes were noted to \nbe likely due to discontinuing his medication. He was found to be at risk for further \nproblems of high-risk behavior given his continued substance abuse (alcohol and \nmarijuana) and history of criminal behavior. (GE 7) (SOR, Guidelines H, I) \nThe DOD evaluators concluded that: \n[Applicant], currently and by history, has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, \nwhich has required several hospitalizations, most recently in October 2020. \nAnd has a longstanding history of behaviors of concern, which may suggest \nthe presence of a material defect in his ability and/or willingness to properly \nsafeguard classified information or perform sensitive duties.

(Tr. 21-25) \n \nWhen asked what had changed in his life since the DOD CAF medical evaluation \nin December 2021, Applicant said he was committed to improvement, through his wife\u2019s \ndevotion and as a dedicated Christian. He puts his faith first and chooses to resist the \ntemptations of drugs and alcohol. (Tr. 26-27) \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he understands the security concerns at issue \nsince his October 2020 relapse. He said he has been \u201cproactive\u201d in following weekly and \nmonthly therapy and counseling to learn more coping techniques. He continues to \nparticipate in the CR recovery program as well as a 12-step program. (Tr. 18, 54 AE A) He \nacknowledged that, while bipolar anxiety disorder does not have a cure, he remains on \nprescribed medications and can achieve \u201ca balanced quality of life and a clarity of mind.\u201d \n(Tr. 19) He expressed remorse for his actions and hopes to avoid repeating his patterns \nof the past.

(Tr. 76-77) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted a February 2023 letter from Dr. L, a Ph.D. \nlicensed clinical psychologist, who has been treating Applicant since November 2020, for \n\u201cpsychotherapeutic treatment of his bipolar depression, alcoholism, chemical dependency, \nand related emotional-behavioral difficulties.\u201d (AE B) Dr. L administers voluntary, random \ndrug tests to Applicant, and he has tested negative since October 2022. This five-month \nperiod is Applicant\u2019s longest period of \u201cclean drug screenings\u201d since Dr. L has been \ntreating him. Dr. L wrote that Applicant is in the \u201cearly stages of his recovery.\u201d He has had \nnumerous relapses during the past two years of his treatment, through October 2022. Dr. \nL is cautiously optimistic that Applicant will continue his recovery successfully. (AE B) (Dr. \nL\u2019s conclusions suggest more frequent drug usage since October 2020 than Applicant \nadmitted during his testimony). \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife also submitted a letter. She has known Applicant for almost 20 \nyears, and they have been married for almost six years. They have had challenges, but \nshe is confident in her husband\u2019s recovery because he is devoted and committed to the \ntreatment plan. It includes weekly therapy and counseling sessions, attendance in a \nrecovery program, and a church men\u2019s group. Applicant is remorseful for his past actions \nand regrets stopping his medication in October 2020 while coping with his mother\u2019s death \nand his son\u2019s arrest. His job with the Navy is fulfilling and satisfying. She requests that he \nbe allowed to retain his clearance as he is the family\u2019s sole source of income. (AE C) \n \nTwo work colleagues of Applicant\u2019s both presented similar positive testimony in \nsupport of his eligibility for a clearance. Mr. W has worked at the Navy facility, with a \nclearance, since 2008, after 20 years in the Marine Corps. He has been Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor in one capacity or another over the last three years. They have daily contact. \nApplicant \u201cgives 100 percent every time he\u2019s at work.\u201d He is in the \u201c98th  percentile\u201d of \npeople in terms of integrity and getting the job done. He is a responsible man who takes \ncare of his wife and children. He has told the truth about his past. Mr. W strongly favors \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. (Tr. 56-63) \nMr. S, a Navy veteran and clearance holder, is a co-worker of Applicant\u2019s for about \nthe last year. He attested to Applicant\u2019s strong work ethic. Applicant took Mr. S under his \nwing and took the initiative to be welcoming to Mr. S when he started at the Navy facility. \nIf Mr. S had to choose someone to be on his team, he would close Applicant first. He gets \nthe job done in a safe, professional manner. If Applicant were to leave, the organization \nwould be greatly impacted. \u201cIf the government is looking for good people, then he is one \nof them,\u201d he said.

Security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. The objective of the security \nclearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s life to make \nan affirmative determination whether the person is eligible for a security clearance. The \nadjudicative process is an evaluation of the whole person. It recognizes that we should \nview persons by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations, and a number of other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, and applying sound judgment, \ncommon sense, and careful analysis. \nThe standard for security clearance decisions is whether granting or continuing \neligibility for a clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. In all \nadjudications, the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. \nTherefore, any doubt concerning a person being considered for access to classified \ninformation must be resolved in favor of national security. \nAnalysis \nThe SOR prepared by the DOD CAF details allegations and security concerns \nunder Guideline G (three unnumbered subparagraphs); Guideline H (eight unnumbered \nsubparagraphs), Guideline I (six unnumbered subparagraphs); Guideline J (seven \nunnumbered subparagraphs). \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe alcohol consumption guideline notes several conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n8 \n\n                                                             \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was hospitalized and treated for substance abuse at VA facilities in 2013 \nand 2015-2016. He was diagnosed with substance abuse disorder, alcohol, during his \n2015-2016 treatment at the VA. He was referred to AA and subsequently tested positive \nfor alcohol use in 2017. (SOR, Guideline G, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2) \nHospitalizations and treatments for substance abuse (alcohol or otherwise) are not, \nthemselves, disqualifying conduct under Guideline G; indeed, an applicant\u2019s efforts to \naddress substance abuse issues through treatment and counseling is evidence to be \nconsidered in mitigation. However, subsequent alcohol use that is contrary to treatment \nrecommendations is potentially disqualifying. AG \u00b6 22(d) applies to the diagnoses in 2013 \nand 2015-2016 and AG \u00b6 22(f) applies to his subsequent alcohol use. \nApplicant was arrested in December 2017 for assault on a family member. (SOR, \nGuideline G, \u00b6 1). He acknowledged drinking at the time of the incident. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s December 2021 DOD evaluation by a clinical psychologist, he \nwas diagnosed with alcohol dependence in partial remission but continued to use alcohol. \n(SOR, Guideline G, \u00b6 3) AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and 22(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol involvement security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in a \ntreatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with \nany required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has a long history of alcohol issues. He has been diagnosed with \nsubstance abuse disorder several times, by the VA in 2015-2016, and most likely in 2013 \n9 \n\n                                                            \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas well, though this is less clear.

He continues with regular, frequent, \nongoing participation in the CR recovery program, and continues as a patient with more \nthan one psychologist regularly for his \u201cbipolar depression, alcoholism, chemical \ndependency and related emotional-behavioral difficulties.\u201d However, he has a history of \nrelapses, including in October 2020, and subsequently. He has been diagnosed most \nrecently, in December 2021, with alcohol dependence, in partial remission. He was also \nfound to have consumed alcohol, including at times to excess, suggesting that he was \nstruggling to manage his addiction. He acknowledged drinking as recently as August or \nSeptember 2022. His issues with alcohol, intertwined with his other, ongoing substance \nabuse issues (Guideline H, below) and psychological conditions (Guideline I, below), are \nboth long-term and ongoing, and they continue to cast doubt on his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply.  \nApplicant is credited with his ongoing efforts to address his alcohol (and other) \nissues, through repeated hospitalizations, treatment periods, ongoing professional therapy \nand medication, and group counseling. But he has a history of repeated relapses that \ncannot be ignored in considering the risk of future issues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b), 23(c), and 23(d) \ndo not apply to mitigate Applicant\u2019s problematic history of alcohol involvement.  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the trustworthiness concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \ndrugs, and the use of other substances that can cause physical or mental \nimpairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended use can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment \nand because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \n\u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n10 \n\n                                                            \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder; \n(e) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical or mental health professional; and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nIt is illegal under Federal law to manufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, \nincluding marijuana. (Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844) All \ncontrolled substances are classified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical \nuses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \n(\u00a7\u00a7811, 812) Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based \non its high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use \nin medically supervised treatment. (\u00a7812(b)(1); See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005)) \nApplicant used both cocaine and marijuana on an approximately daily basis from \n2012 to December 2015. (SOR, Guideline H, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6, 7) He said he had not used cocaine \nsince then but, acknowledged in his December 2021 medical evaluation that he had used \nmarijuana in the past few months. (SOR, Guideline H, \u00b6 8) AG \u00b6 25(a) applies to both the \ncocaine use and the marijuana use. \n \n(Note: Under Guideline H, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 7 of Guideline H allege weekly (rather \nthan \u201cdaily\u201d) cocaine and marijuana use by Applicant in various periods between 2012 and \n2015, as detailed in his August 2019 background interview. However, that background \ninterview is not in evidence here).  \nApplicant was charged with possession of marijuana in 2015. (SOR. Guideline H, \n\u00b6 2). AG \u00b6 25(c) applies. \nApplicant was hospitalized and treated for substance abuse in 2013, 2015 and from \n2015-2016. (SOR, Guideline H, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, 5) As with alcohol, hospitalizations and treatments \nfor substance abuse are not, themselves, disqualifying conduct under Guideline H; indeed, \nan applicant\u2019s efforts to address substance abuse issues through treatment and \ncounseling is evidence to be considered in mitigation. However, he was also diagnosed \nwith cocaine dependence and marijuana/cannabis dependence during his 2015-2016 \ntreatment at the VA. (SOR, Guideline H, \u00b6 5) \nAG \u00b6 25(d) applies to those diagnoses. It also applies to the DOD\u2019s December 2021 \ndiagnoses of cannabis dependence, uncomplicated, in partial remission, and cocaine \ndependence, uncomplicated, in partial remission. \n11 \n\n                                                            \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26, including the following: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is grounds for revocation \nof national trustworthiness eligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant\u2019s issues with illegal drugs are not mitigated for largely the same reasons \nas set forth under Guideline G. He has a long history of extensive illegal drug use, most \nprominently from 2012 to 2015. During that time, he made several attempts at treatment \nfor his substance abuse issues but has had several relapses and recurring instances of \nmarijuana use since then. He used marijuana only months before his December 2021 \nDOD evaluation and used marijuana as recently as August or September 2022, only \nmonths ago. He is in counseling and is subject to random drug tests by his psychologist, \nDr. L, but his most recent period of abstinence (five months) is the longest such period of \nabstinence since Applicant has been under Dr. L\u2019s care (since November 2020). This \nsuggests more relapses, and more frequent relapses, than Applicant admitted during his \nhearing. Regardless, given his diagnoses of cocaine dependence and cannabis \ndependence, both in remission, five months of abstinence is not nearly enough to establish \nthat his issues with illegal drugs are in his past and are unlikely to recur. No AGs apply to \nmitigate the Guideline H security concerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct:  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n12 \n\n                                                            \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant has continued to use marijuana, an illegal \ndrug under federal law, since 2012. (SOR, Guideline J, \u00b6 7) (Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine \nfrom 2012-2015, also illegal, is not alleged). AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) both apply.  \nApplicant had several criminal offenses between 1991 and December 2017, \nincluding: a February 1991 DUI (alleged under Guideline J, but not Guideline G); a \nFebruary 2000 citation for public intoxication (same); a marijuana possession charge in \nSeptember 2015; and arrests for assault on a family member, in January 2002 and \nDecember 2017. (SOR, Guideline J, \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 5-6) AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) both apply. \nThe final Guideline J allegation (\u00b6 4) at issue concerns Applicant\u2019s NJP in \nNovember 2010 under Article 15 of the UCMJ for possession of child pornography, for \nwhich he received a letter or reprimand (and which led to his separation the Navy). The \nunderlying records for this offense are not in the record here, though the proceeding is \nlisted on Applicant\u2019s FBI record. Applicant acknowledged putting an external hard drive \nthat contained \u201cexplicit files\u201d into a government computer and acknowledged that there \nwas an allegation that one of the files contained an image of someone underage. Despite \nthe limited record evidence on this allegation, AG \u00b6 31(b) nonetheless applies. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions for criminal \nconduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe case for mitigation under Guideline J is arguably greater than for the other \nguidelines at issue here. Applicant has not had any criminal charges, citations, or offenses \nsince December 2017, now over five years ago. The incident with the external hard drive, \nthough serious enough to lead to his separation from the Navy, is now over 10 years old. \nIt is, however, another instance of poor judgment. Nonetheless, Applicant\u2019s continued \n13 \n\n                                                            \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvolvement with marijuana (which remains illegal under federal law) precludes a finding \nthat his criminal conduct issues are mitigated. Further, they are sufficiently intertwined with \nhis other, unresolved issues (alcohol, drugs, and psychological conditions) that it is difficult \nto mitigate the criminal conduct solely due to the lack of recent charges. Applicant is \ncredited under this guideline with a good employment record, and with his continued efforts \nto address his issues in counseling. But his issues are too intertwined and too recent to \nwarrant mitigation. No Guideline J mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set forth in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 28. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nApplicant\u2019s voluntary hospitalizations from September 2013 to October 2013, in \nSeptember 2015, from December 2015 to January 2016, and in October 2020 (SOR, \nGuideline I, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) satisfy AG \u00b6 28(c). \n14 \n\n                                                            \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was diagnosed in 2010 with bipolar disorder and in December 2015 with \ncyclothymic disorder, bipolar mood disorder, and substance abuse disorder, alcohol. \n(SOR, Guideline I, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5) His diagnosis of bipolar disorder was confirmed in the DOD\u2019s \nDecember 2021 medical evaluation, by a qualified Ph.D. clinical psychologist. (SOR, \nGuideline I, \u00b6 6) Applicant\u2019s bipolar disorder has been determined to be a condition that \nmay impair his judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. \nApplicant has a history of non-compliance with his treatment plan, including in \nOctober 2020, when he stopped taking his medication during a stressful period in his life, \nafter his mother\u2019s death and his son\u2019s arrest. (SOR, Guideline I, \u00b6 6) AG \u00b6 28(d) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s substance abuse issues (and related criminal conduct) constitute \n\u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness,\u201d but those issues are also alleged under other guidelines and found to be \ndisqualifying. Thus, it cannot be said that they are \u201cnot covered under any other guideline\u201d \neven if they \u201cmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition. As such, \u00b6 AG \n28(a) does not apply. Nevertheless, Applicant remains at risk for future high-risk behaviors \ndue to his bipolar disorder and long history of substance abuse. \nAG \u00b6 29 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions for psychological \nconditions under Guideline I: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nNo Guideline I mitigation conditions apply, largely for the same reasons as set forth \nunder the other guidelines. Applicant was diagnosed with cocaine dependence and \ncannabis dependence, both in remission. He has several diagnoses of bipolar disorder \nover several years. To his credit, Applicant has been in professional counseling with two \n15 \n\n                                                            \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounselors or psychologists, and he has been participating in group therapy and a 12-step \nprogram through a church. \nSince November 2020, Applicant has seen Dr. L for \u201cpsychotherapeutic treatment \nof his bipolar depression, alcoholism, chemical dependency, and related emotional-\nbehavioral difficulties.\u201d (AE B) Applicant is in the \u201cearly stages of his recovery,\u201d and Dr. L \nis cautiously optimistic that Applicant will continue his recovery successfully. However, \nApplicant has had numerous relapses during the past two years of his treatment, through \nOctober 2022. His recent five-months of sobriety, since fall 2022, is his longest such period \nwhile under Dr. L\u2019s care. As Dr. L noted, Applicant has had several relapses since \nNovember 2020 (and more than Applicant admitted during his own testimony). Further, \nApplicant\u2019s bipolar diagnosis is intertwined with his long-term issues of substance abuse \n(both alcohol and illegal drugs). This increases the risk of future problematic behavior. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(b) do not fully apply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(d) and 29(e) are simply not established. \nWhole-Person Analysis  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. An administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G, H, J, and I in my whole-person analysis. \nIn weighing the whole-person evidence, I credit and acknowledge the testimony of \nApplicant\u2019s two co-workers, both of whom attested to his integrity, work ethic, \nprofessionalism, and value to his employer. I also credit the letter from Applicant\u2019s wife, \nwho is supporting him on his path to recovery. I also credit Applicant\u2019s long and honorable \nservice to the Navy and the nation, both in and out of uniform. However, I must also \nconsider his long history of substance abuse issues, criminal history, and his psychological \ncondition. Applicant has made several efforts to address his issues, and those efforts are \nongoing, with the help of doctors and counselors. But his issues are long-term, his \nrecovery is in the early stages, and he has had recent relapses. Given his long history and \n16 \n\n                                                            \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nhis pattern of track record of substance abuse, sobriety, treatment, and relapse, coupled \nwith his ongoing bipolar disorder, he has not established that his various security concerns \nare in his past and unlikely to recur.

I cannot conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to recommend that Applicant regain his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation, or a national security sensitive position. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Accordingly, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant him renewed access to classified information and assignment to sensitive \nduties. \nFormal Findings \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1-3:  \nAgainst Applicant \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1-8:  \nAgainst Applicant \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1-6: \nAgainst Applicant \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1-7:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegations, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 37-year-old petty officer E-6 on active duty in the U.S. Navy. He graduated from high school in May 2004, and he attended college from February 2019 to January 2020, but he did not earn a degree. As of the date of the hearing, he was re- enrolled in college and expected to earn an associate degree in October 2023. He worked for various employers since July 2004, except for a period of unemployment from September 2006 to February 2007. He enlisted in the Navy in September 2007 and has served on active duty continuously until the present. He was deployed in 2013 and 2019. He first received a security clearance in 2010 and was granted a top secret clearance and access to sensitive compartmented information in approximately 2015.

Applicant answered \nSOR 1 and SOR 2 on November 9, 2022 (Answer). \nOn November 26, 2022, the DOD CAS revoked Applicant\u2019s clearance, and he \nappealed the revocation under the provisions of DOD Manual 5200.02. On December 2, \n2022, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence and Security), Ronald Moultrie, issued \na memorandum providing that any individual whose clearance eligibility was revoked or \ndenied between September 30, 2022, and the date of that memorandum shall be afforded \nthe opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process set forth in DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992). As a result of Under Secretary Moultrie\u2019s Memorandum, Applicant was given the \nopportunity to receive the process set forth in DOD Directive 5220.6. He elected that \nprocess, and his case was assigned to me on January 18, 2023. \nOn January 27, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that his hearing was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on \nFebruary 15, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified. He did not \nsubmit any documentary evidence. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until \nMarch 1, 2023, to enable him to submit documentation. He timely submitted \ndocumentation, which I collectively marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 23, 2023. \nSOR Amendment \nDepartment Counsel amended the SOR at the hearing, pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.13 of \nDOD Directive 5220.6 and withdrew the Guideline G and Guideline J SOR concerns. (Tr. \nat 11-13) Since those allegations have been withdrawn, they will not be discussed further. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegations, with explanations. \nHis admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old petty officer E-6 on active duty in the U.S. Navy. He \ngraduated from high school in May 2004, and he attended college from February 2019 to \nJanuary 2020, but he did not earn a degree. As of the date of the hearing, he was re-\nenrolled in college and expected to earn an associate degree in October 2023. He worked \nfor various employers since July 2004, except for a period of unemployment from \nSeptember 2006 to February 2007. He enlisted in the Navy in September 2007 and has \nserved on active duty continuously until the present. He was deployed in 2013 and 2019. \nHe first received a security clearance in 2010 and was granted a top secret clearance \nand access to sensitive compartmented information in approximately 2015.

Applicant also discussed his debts during his April 2022 interview with a \nbackground investigator. He attributes his delinquent debts primarily to his ex-spouse\u2019s \nmismanagement of their finances during his 2019 deployment; his child support obligation \nof $720 monthly for his eldest child since 2017; his divorce; and his ex-spouse\u2019s \nunwillingness to assist him with resolving the debts incurred during their marriage. He first \nbegan to learn about his delinquent debts when he separated from his ex-spouse, and he \ncontinued to learn about them through the security clearance process. He also incurred \nexpenses when he moved his family into base housing, and he was the sole breadwinner \nuntil his spouse started nursing school just three weeks before the hearing.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a)(\u201c inability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are established. Applicant incurred his delinquent debts \nduring his previous marriage, when his ex-spouse mishandled their finances while he was \ndeployed. This was a condition largely beyond his control.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations): \nFOR APPLICAN\nDebt #1 through Debt #10: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

[his] case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination \nbased solely\u201d on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 6 (emphasis added)) \nApplicant did not provide any response to the FORM. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c). Additional discussion will be in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance.

The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security .clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

From \nabout August 2013 to about January 2022, he purchased, used, and sold marijuana with \nvarying frequency. From about December 2019 to about January 2022, he used, \npurchased, and sold cocaine with varying frequency. In about November 2019, he used \nand purchased Xanax, that was not prescribed to him, and in about March 2019, he used \nLSD. In about February 2018, he used nitrous oxide in a manner inconsistent with its \nintended purpose. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed \nhis drug involvement and misuse during the security clearance process. He made \nimportant changes in his lifestyle, and he promised that he would not abuse drugs in the \nfuture. \nHowever, notwithstanding this mitigating information, I am not convinced his \nextensive drug involvement and substance misuse \u201chappened under such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur [and] does not cast doubt on [his] current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d More time without abuse of drugs is needed to \nincrease assurance that future drug involvement and substance misuse will not recur. \nGuideline H security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 24-year-old systems engineer who is employed by DOD contractor. \nIn 2021, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. He disclosed his involvement with \nmarijuana, LSD, cocaine, and nitrous oxide, and his abuse of prescription drugs Adderall, \nXanax, and Vyvanse on his SCA. He has never been arrested. He does not abuse \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nalcohol. He does not have any disclosable delinquent financial accounts. He has not had \nany security violations. The information provided during his Office of Personnel \nManagement interview about his drug involvement and substance misuse was consistent \nwith his SCA. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nFrom August 2013 to May 2022, Applicant possessed, used, or sold multiple substances \nlisted in Schedule I, II, and IV of the Controlled Substance Act. He was involved with \nmarijuana, LSD, cocaine, and nitrous oxide, and he abused prescription drugs Adderall, \nXanax, and Vyvanse. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

The U.S. \nDepartment of State travel advisory for Iran is Level 4. Do not travel to Iran due to risk \nof kidnapping, and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens \nvisiting or residing in Iran have been kidnapped, arrested, and detained on spurious \ncharges. Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens on \nspurious charges, particularly Iranian-Americans, including students, journalists, \nbusiness travelers, and academics, on charges including espionage and posing a threat \nto national security. \nThe U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular \nrelations with Iran and is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iran. \nSignificant human rights issues included credible reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings \nby the government and its agents, most commonly execution for crimes not meeting the \ninternational legal standard of \u201cmost serious crimes\u201d or for crimes committed by juvenile \noffenders, as well as after trials without due process; forced disappearance attributed to \nthe government and its agents; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment by the \ngovernment and its agents; arbitrary arrest or detention; harsh and life-threatening \nprison conditions; political prisoners and detainees; politically motivated reprisals \nagainst individuals in another country; including killings kidnappings, or violence, \nserious problems with independence of the judiciary, particularly the revolutionary \ncourts; and unlawful interference with privacy. \nThe Iranian government has taken few steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, \nand punish officials who committed human rights abuses or corruption. \nImpunity \nremained pervasive throughout all levels of the government and security forces. (HE-1) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father as well as his father-in-law are dual citizens of the \nU.S. and Iran.  They have immigrated to the U.S. to make it their home.  Applicant has \nlimited contact with anyone in Iran and has not traveled there since 2012.  Any foreign \nfamily ties that Applicant may have in Iran pose a heightened security risk for the United \nStates Government.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and two of them are applicable in this case. \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nFamily ties in a foreign country raises a prima facie security concern that \nrequired the applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation \nsufficient to meet the burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. Thus, Applicant bears the \nburden to establish that his relatives are not vulnerable to influence, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. In this case, Applicant carefully explained that most of his family \nis in the U.S. His mother and father are naturalized U.S. citizens. His two siblings are \nalso naturalized U.S. citizens. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen. His children are \nnative-born Americans. The only person who remains in Iran is his mother-in-law who \nis in the process of immigrating to the U.S. to be with the rest of her family. Applicant \ndoes not discuss anything with his family members about his work or his job and he has \nno plans to ever do so. None of his foreign family members in Iran are affiliated in any \nway with any foreign government. \nIt is recognized that Applicant is at a higher risk of being targeted for Iranian \nintelligence gathering since he works for a defense contractor. Thus, it can be assumed \nthat Applicant will continue to place the interest of the U.S. paramount, and always \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect the U.S. from any risk of terrorism, and/or any situation that could place the \ninterests of the U.S. in jeopardy. Under the circumstances, Applicant has met his \nburden and has established the two mitigating conditions set forth above under \nGuideline B. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent, hard-working Engineer, who performs well at \nhis job, and has the endorsement of his manager. It is also noted that while he was \nborn in Iran, he is a naturalized U.S. citizen by choice. He is proud of his many \naccomplishments in the U.S. that he has achieved on his own. With his wife and \nchildren as his closest family ties, who are naturalized and native Americans, along with \nboth of his parents and his father-in-law, who are all naturalized U.S. citizens, Applicant \nhas established that his permanent life is here in the United States. \nHe has no \nintentions of ever returning to Iran. There is nothing in Iran for him. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The case \nwas assigned to me on June 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant purchased and used marijuana \nfrom about January 2002 until about January 2022, and that he purchased and used \ncocaine from about January 2008 until about April 2022. In response to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted all allegations. (Items 1, 2, 3) \nApplicant is 39 years old. He received an associate degree in 2017 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2019. He married in November 2019 and his wife was pregnant with \ntheir first child when he responded to the FORM. He has been employed by a federal \ncontractor since June 2022 as an IT Specialist. He has worked as a restaurant server \nsince 2011. He has no military experience and has never held a security clearance. (Items \n4, 5; AE A) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in July 2022. He \ndisclosed that he had purchased and used marijuana from January 2002 to January 2022. \nHe first used marijuana in high school, characterized his use as casual, social and \nrecreational, noted that marijuana was a regular part of his life in his early 20\u2019s, and that \nhis frequency of use dropped considerably as he aged. He could not provide an accurate \nnumber of times that he had used marijuana. (Items 4, 5; AE A) \nApplicant also reported that he had purchased and used cocaine from January \n2008 to April 2022. He characterized his use as casual and social, noted that he usually \nused cocaine while drinking with friends and that his frequency of use varied from periods \nof regular use (weekly or bi-weekly) to periods where he would not use cocaine for years \nat a time. (Items 4, 5; AE A) \nAppellant stated that he did not intend to purchase or use marijuana, cocaine or \nother controlled substances in the future, He identified three reasons why he no longer \nintended to use marijuana or cocaine: (1) he and his wife were trying to start a family \nwhich provided a source of motivation to clean up his life and facilitate his family\u2019s growth \nand prosperity; (2) he was inspired by a close friend, a high functioning alcoholic, who \nhad completed rehabilitation, cleaned up his act to help raise his daughter and was now \nthe happiest and healthiest Applicant had ever seen him, and (3) he was also motivated \nto stop using drugs and drinking by the recent death of a close friend who died from an \noverdose.

(Items 4, 5; AE A) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in August 2022 and \nauthenticated the accuracy of the summary of that interview. His interview responses \nwere consistent with his SCA disclosures and included the following additional \ninformation. (Items 4, 5) \nHe purchased marijuana from friends and used marijuana with friends and while \nalone. Marijuana made him feel high but after a while he started feeling useless and was \nnot productive. He purchased and used cocaine for about 14 years. He purchased \ncocaine from within his social circle, never from people that he did not know. He used \ncocaine in homes and bars, often while drinking alcohol. His marijuana use was a big part \nof his life and widely known, and most of his friends were aware that he used cocaine. He \nhas never grown, produced, or sold marijuana or cocaine. He has never had a positive \ndrug test or been arrested. He reiterated and emphasized his motivations for and intent \nto abstain from future use of marijuana, cocaine, and other controlled substances. (Items \n4, 5)  \nApplicant said that at some point in his mid-twenties, he felt dependent on cocaine \nbut overcame it. He reduced his use and took up golf as a hobby. He reported that his \ncocaine use had strained his marriage when his spouse asked him to stop, he was unable \nto do so and then lied about it. He weaned himself from cocaine when he got married and \ntried to have a baby. After reducing his use, he lost his craving for cocaine. He last used \ncocaine after his friend died. (Item 5)  \nApplicant did not provide documents or evidence in response to the SOR, but did \nprovide an email, signed statement, photo, and letter of intent to abstain from the illegal \nuse of controlled substances in response to the FORM. (Item 3; AE A) \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant reported that his wife was 15-weeks \npregnant and included a photo of a recent ultrasound. He said that he had been drug free \nfor over a year and reduced his alcohol consumption by \u201croughly 99.9 percent\u201d to an \noccasional beer at dinner with his father-in-law. His \u201cdesire to indulge in drug use or \nconsume alcohol is completely gone\u201d and he is motivated to permanently maintain these \npositive changes in his life. He is particularly motivated by his desire and responsibility to \nprovide a thriving home environment for his child. He reported that he no longer goes to \nbars, clubs or house parties where drugs and alcohol are commonly used.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25(a) (\u201cany substance misuse\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) (\u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . purchase\u201d). The \nfollowing mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s substance misuse was recent, frequent, \noccurred over a period of 20 years, and casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement, stated that he has abstained from illegally using controlled substances since \nApril 2022, disassociated from persons who use drugs, avoids environments where drugs \nare used, and submitted a notarized letter of intent to abstain from the illegal use of \ncontrolled substances in the future. However, the mitigating impact of his abstinence and \nother claimed actions are limited by his 20-year drug usage history including that he most \nrecently used cocaine after the death of a friend about three months before submitting his \nSCA. See ISCR Case No. 11-00193 (App. Bd. Jan. 24, 2013). Additionally, he has \nprovided no evidence corroborating his claims of abstinence, disassociation from persons \nwho use drugs, or avoidance of environments where drugs are used.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his drug involvement. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith a longer period of abstinence from substance misuse, he may be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

These allegations are found for Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of these mitigating conditions are established. Applicant, after an eight-year \nhiatus, has only recently taken affirmative action to address his very substantial past-due \nstudent loans. Another past-due educational loan of nearly $3,000 has yet to be \naddressed. He has demonstrated only very recent efforts to resolve his delinquencies. \nHis efforts are too little, too late. Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the \nfinancial concerns set out in the SOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g. \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nOn March 16, 2023, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing.

On October 5, 2023, he submitted four documents \nin response to the FORM, which I have marked as Applicant exhibits (AE) A-D. Items 2-\n7 are admitted into evidence, as are AE A-D. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 9, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted some of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c, 1.e-1.g, and 1.j) and \ndenied others (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.h-1.i).

He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since August 2021, as a senior solution specialist. He has worked \ncontinuously since 2009, except for two periods of unemployment in November 2013 \nand from January 2015 to February 2015. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He married for \nthird time in 2014. He has two adult children. (Item 3). \nThe SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his 2021 federal income tax return. \nIt also alleged that he owed delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2014-2016 and 2019 \ntotaling $82,868 and he owed delinquent state taxes for tax year 2014, in the amount of \n$90,000. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). The SOR also alleged Applicant incurred seven delinquent \nconsumer debts totaling approximately $1,290.

He also stated periods of unemployment contributed to his financial \ndistress. (Item 2) \nThe record contains conflicting information concerning the filing of Applicant\u2019s \n2021 federal income tax return. In his SOR answer, Applicant denied that his 2021 \nfederal return was not filed. He requested from the IRS a tax account transcript for tax \nyear 2021 on October 21, 2022. That tax account transcript indicated that as of August \n23, 2021, no tax return had been filed by Applicant. (Item 4) In his response to the \nFORM, Applicant submitted an IRS tax return transcript for tax year 2021. His request \nfor this transcript was made on August 30, 2023. This transcript indicated that Applicant \nfiled his 2021 tax return on August 1, 2022. (AE B) The filing deadline for 2021 was April \n18, 2021.

There is no evidence Applicant filed an extension. \nNeither transcript shows that Applicant owed taxes for 2021. (Item 4; AE B) \nApplicant admitted owing taxes to the federal government in the amount of \napproximately $82,868 for tax years 2014-2016 and 2019. An IRS account transcript for \ntax year 2014 indicated that Applicant owed approximately $50,690. (Item 4) During his \nApril 2022 background interview, he told an investigator that he set up a payment plan \nwith the IRS to pay $1,500 monthly toward his delinquent federal taxes. He also said \nthat he was two months behind on those payments. In his security clearance application \n(SCA), he stated that he resumed making his monthly payments to the IRS in October \n2021, without providing corroborating documentation. He did not provide a copy of his \npayment plan with the IRS. He provided a copy of an IRS payment due notice dated \nSeptember 6, 2023, showing that his $1,500 monthly payment was due on September \n18, 2023. The notice also showed that Applicant\u2019s total amount owed was \napproximately $198,800 (any amount owed that exceeds the amount alleged in the \nSOR will not be considered by me for disqualification purposes, but I may consider it for \nmitigation and during my whole-person analysis). There is no documentation showing \nthat Applicant made this monthly payment. (Items 2-4; AE C) \nApplicant admitted in his SCA and his SOR answer that he owed $90,000 to his \nstate tax authority for his 2014 taxes. Aside, from this admission, he did not provide any \nfurther information on the status of this tax debt. The Government presented \ndocumentary evidence showing his state filed a lien against him in 2017 for unpaid state \ntaxes in the amount of approximately $24,000. There is no evidence showing this lien \nwas released or that these taxes were paid. (Items 1-2; 5) \nApplicant presented documentation showing that the alleged delinquent debts in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.j were either paid or the accounts are now in good standing. While, the record \ndoes not contain information on whether \u00b6 1.d was paid, its small alleged balance of \n$52 makes it insignificant as a security concern. These debts have been resolved. (AE \nD) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant owes delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2014-2016 and 2019. He \nalso owes state taxes for 2014. He incurred delinquent consumer debts that he has \nsubsequently paid. All the above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal and state taxes remain unresolved. He did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. His own \nevidence showed that his federal tax debt has risen past the original amount alleged in \nthe SOR. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. While his son\u2019s medical condition and his brief \nperiods of unemployment are conditions beyond his control, those events occurred \nalmost 10 years ago. The evidence does not support that he has taken responsible \nactions to pay the delinquent taxes he owes. Apparently he has a payment plan with the \nIRS, but he failed to show that any payments have been made or the terms of the \npayment plan. There is also no evidence showing he has addressed his state tax debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, and the evidence is insufficient to \nestablish that his tax debt is under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. He has shown a \ngood-faith effort to address his delinquent debts, other than his tax debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) \napplies to his consumer debts alleged, but not to the tax debts. \nApplicant filed his 2021 federal tax return late in August 2022 and he apparently \nhas a payment plan with the IRS. There is no evidence of a payment plan with his state \ntax authority. AG \u00b6 20(g) has some applicability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant resolved \nhis consumer debts. But, I also considered his lack of progress in resolving his federal \nand state tax debt. Applicant has not established a track record of financial \nresponsibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked with his current employer since February 2016. Additionally, since about 1999, he has continuously maintained employment in a part-time position on weekends with a non- defense employer. He earned his associate\u2019s degree in May 2010, and his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2012. He married in 1993 and has five children, ages 30, 21, 18, 9 and 7 years old.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked with \nhis current employer since February 2016. Additionally, since about 1999, he has \ncontinuously maintained employment in a part-time position on weekends with a non-\ndefense employer. He earned his associate\u2019s degree in May 2010, and his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in May 2012. He married in 1993 and has five children, ages 30, 21, 18, 9 and 7 \nyears old. His wife does not work outside of the family home. (Items 3 and 4) \nThe SOR alleges 17 financial concerns including three Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \nactions filed via voluntary petition in 1994, 2001, and 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c), in addition \nto 14 delinquent debts altogether totaling about $21,053. Applicant\u2019s three bankruptcy \nfilings are reflected in court records (Items 5, 6, and 7), and his delinquent debts are \nreflected in credit bureau reports from May 2022 and March 2023. (Items 8 and 9) \nIn his May 2022 SCA, Applicant disclosed he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition \nin June 2015 and that his debts, which totaled about $20,000, were discharged in about \nSeptember 2015. He stated he was overwhelmed with expenses at the time due to \nworking while attending school. His wife was not working, he stated, because of childcare \nexpenses. (Item 3 at 32, and Item 4 at 2) During his July 2022 DOD investigative \ninterview, Applicant did not disclose or discuss his two previous Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetitions: one filed in July 1994 and discharged in November 1994; and the other filed in \nOctober 2001 and discharged in February 2002. During the same interview, he disclosed \nhis intent to possibly file another bankruptcy petition in August 2023 because, as he \nstated, he would be eligible to file again after waiting about eight years. (Item 4 at 3) \nApplicant disclosed that his monthly net income totaled about $3,664 for both his \nfull and part-time positions, and he estimated his monthly expenses, excluding credit card \ndebts not being paid, totaled about $4,000. He stated there were no plans for his wife to \nstart working because she takes care of their children, and her working would require him \nto purchase another car. He further disclosed his wife handles the household finances, \nand that she pays her own bills, but does not pay bills in his name. When asked about a \nfuture financial plan, he stated that he hoped to reduced expenses when his older children \nleave home, and he also hoped to have his student loans forgiven as well. His student \nloans of about $40,000, were in a deferred status at the time of the interview.

Bankruptcy \ncourt records in Items 5, 6, and 7 support allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.c., as admitted. \nApplicant\u2019s multiple bankruptcies resulted primarily from consumer debts. In his 2001 \nbankruptcy action, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Justice \n(DOJ) were among the listed creditors. (Item 6 at 4) The cause or amount of Applicant\u2019s \nindebtedness to these federal agencies is not provided in the record. (Item 6) Additionally, \nCourt records of his 2015 bankruptcy showed that his student loan debts actually totaled \nmore than $45,000 at that time. (Item 7 at 1) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($4,879), 1.e ($3,278), and 1.h ($1,905) Applicant admitted all three \ndelinquent debts. For each debt, he exceeded the creditor-granted credit limit. All \naccounts were eventually charged off by the creditors after Applicant became 150 days \nor more delinquent on required payments. (Item 8 pp. 3-4; and Item 9 pp. 4, 6, and 8) \nThese debts are unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,419): Applicant admitted this debt. He opened this individual account \nin November 2017. The debt was charged off for $1,419 in about March 2022 after it \nbecome150 days or more past due. (Item 8 at 4) The March 2023 credit bureau report \nreflected a balance of $1,118, and a payment of $150 in February 2023. Applicant \nappears to have made repayment arrangements with the creditor, and has paid down the \nbalance of the debt by $301 in March 2023. (Item 9 at 7) This debt is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($2,628) and 1.g ($2,611): Applicant admitted both debts. Both are \nindividual accounts that have remained in a collection status since 2021 or earlier. The \nlast activity for both accounts occurred in 2019, with major delinquencies reported in 2021 \nand 2020 respectively.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has a long history of financial problems as \nestablished by his three Chapter 7 bankruptcy actions, starting in 1994. His current \ndelinquent debts are numerous and ongoing and his longstanding delinquent debts in the \nSOR remain unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant has been gainfully employed since at least \n2016, and he has also consistently maintained a second part-time position over this \nperiod. There is no indication he acted responsibly by taking meaningful steps to \nsubstantively address his delinquent debts. He is credited with addressing the one \ndelinquent account, but this action alone is insufficient to establish mitigation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Though Applicant would have been required by \nthe bankruptcy court to participate in financial education and counseling pursuant to his \nbankruptcy actions, his financial problems are not at all under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. Applicant is credited with the taking action to \nbegin addressing one delinquent debt in late 2020. However, he has multiple delinquent \ndebts that he did not act on. He has not communicated with most of his creditors nor has \nhe established a repayment plan to address his other delinquent debts. He also informed \nDOD investigators of his plan to file another bankruptcy action in late 2023, to address \nhis ongoing financial problems, because, as he stated, it had been eight years since his \nlast Chapter 7 bankruptcy action. \nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. I find that financial considerations security concerns remain in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns in this case.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j \u2013 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Items 4, 5)  \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline H, that Applicant used and purchased \nmarijuana from May 2015 to at least May 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged that \nApplicant used marijuana after completing a security clearance application (SCA) on \nApril 7, 2022 (SOR\u00b6 1.b) \nApplicant admitted his marijuana use in his April 2022 SCA, his May 2022 \npersonal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator, and in his March 2023 SOR \nanswer. In his SOR answer, he denied using and purchasing marijuana after completing \nhis SCA in April 2022. He previously admitted using marijuana through May 2022 during \nhis PSI. (Items 3-5) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s PSI, he stated that his marijuana use started in approximately \n2014-2015 after he fell off a truck and injured his back. He admitted not getting proper \nmedical treatment for his injury and instead started using marijuana for pain \nmanagement. In approximately June 2015, he began getting marijuana from his friends \nand smoking it to alleviate his back pain. He used marijuana irregularly from June 2015 \nto August 2016. He abstained from August 2016 to March 2017. After March 2017, he \nstarted using marijuana on weekends sporadically. This frequency of use continued until \nDecember 2018 when he stopped again. From March 2020 until the time of his PSI \n(May 2022), he used marijuana on weekdays. (Item 5) \nIn June 2018, he was ticketed for possession of marijuana because his \npassenger had lit up a marijuana joint just as the police officer arrived. The charge was \ndismissed when his friend admitted ownership of the marijuana.

No further information was \nprovided. (Item 3) \nTo help with his back pain, Applicant claims he now follows his doctor\u2019s advice \nregarding pain management, performs yoga, wears a back brace, uses a massage gun, \nmeditates daily, uses CBD cream, and stretches. (Item 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used and possessed marijuana on multiple occasions between May \n2015 and May 2022. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nI find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b. That allegation alleges \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana \u201cafter completing an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP) on April 7, 2022.\u201d Even if that factual information is \ntrue, it does not establish any disqualifying condition other than what is stated in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. Using any controlled substance after completing a SCA may be aggravating \nconduct, but it does not create a separate disqualifying condition under the AGs.

Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana were frequent and were as recent as \nMay 2022, after he completed his SCA. While I can sympathize with his back-pain \nissues, using marijuana is not a proper or legal treatment plan. He listed ways he is now \ndealing with his back pain without using marijuana. He did not provide a signed \nstatement of his intent not to use drugs in the future. Applicant\u2019s short abstention is \ninsufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. Additionally, his use of marijuana \nafter completing his SCA casts doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply, while AG \u00b6 26(b) has some application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that he used marijuana \nas recently as May 2022, after completing his SCA. I also considered the circumstances \nhe described surrounding his uses and his medical issues. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He failed to submit any documentary evidence. Items 4-5 are \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The case was assigned to me on August 23, \n2023. \nOn September 15, 2023, I issued a decision denying Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.

He also provided some \nexplanation for his conduct. I adopt his partial admission to SOR \u00b6 1.a as a finding of \nfact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. (Items 1, 3) \nApplicant is 25 years old. He is single, never has married, and has no children. \nHe has worked as a network technician for his current employer, a federal contractor, \nsince March 2022. That contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 \nU.S.C. 701 et seq. Applicant completed his academic requirements for his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree, but as of May 2022, it had not been awarded. (Items 4, 5)  \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline H, that Applicant used and purchased \nmarijuana from May 2015 to at least May 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged that \nApplicant used marijuana after completing a security clearance application (SCA) on \nApril 7, 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nApplicant admitted his marijuana use in his April 2022 SCA, his May 2022 \npersonal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator, and in his March 2023 SOR \nanswer. In his SOR answer, he denied using and purchasing marijuana after completing \nhis SCA in April 2022. As noted above, his admissions of marijuana use and purchasing \nconsistently used March 2022 as his cessation date. (Items 3-4) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s PSI, he stated that his marijuana use started in approximately \n2014-2015 after he fell off a truck and injured his back. He admitted not getting proper \nmedical treatment for his injury and instead started using marijuana for pain \nmanagement. In approximately June 2015, he began getting marijuana from his friends \nand smoking it to alleviate his back pain. He used marijuana irregularly from June 2015 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto August 2016. He abstained from August 2016 to March 2017. After March 2017, he \nstarted using marijuana on weekends sporadically. This frequency of use continued until \nDecember 2018 when he stopped again. (Item 5) \nIn June 2018, Applicant was ticketed for possession of marijuana because his \npassenger had lit up a marijuana joint just as the police officer arrived. The charge was \ndismissed when his friend admitted ownership of the marijuana. (Item 5) \nThe information in Applicant\u2019s PSI summary about the end of his marijuana \nactivity is vague and contradictory to his earlier admissions of marijuana use and \npurchasing from May 2015 to March 2022. The ambiguous language from his PSI is: \nSince 03/2020 to present, the Subject no longer uses marijuana on \nweekends because he works on weekends. He occasionally uses \nmarijuana throughout the week on as [sic] a needed basis to help with \npain management particularly at night when the pain causes lack of sleep. \n(Item 5)  \nIn his earlier SCA, Applicant stated his use frequency was, \u201cNightly or weekends \nonly. 1-2 joints.\u201d The investigator did not clarify the discrepancy between these two \nstatements. Additionally, the investigator did not clarify what the term \u201cto present\u201d \nmeant. Was Applicant saying he used marijuana up through his PSI interview in May \n2022? Or was he saying that his use was up until he began working for his current \nemployer in March 2022, which would be consistent with his earlier answers as to when \nhe stopped using marijuana? Because of these ambiguities in his PSI interview \nsummary, which he did not authenticate, I find Applicant\u2019s statements that he ended his \nmarijuana use in March 2022 more credible than the information contained in his PSI. \n(Items 4-5) \nApplicant provided medical information, attached to his SOR answer, that \ndescribed his back pain issues. The doctor performing the most recent examination \n(sometime in 2021) recommended? that Applicant should seek a surgery consult, or if \nno surgery was recommended, he should start physical therapy. No further information \nwas provided. (Item 3) \nTo help with his back pain, Applicant avers he now follows his doctor\u2019s advice \nregarding pain management, performs yoga, wears a back brace, uses a massage gun, \nmeditates daily, uses CBD cream, and stretches. He longer associates with people who \nare known drug users. (Items 3, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used and possessed marijuana on multiple occasions between May \n2015 and March 2022. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nI find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b. That allegation alleges \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana \u201cafter completing an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP) on April 7, 2022.\u201d Even if that factual information is \ntrue, it does not establish any disqualifying condition other than what is stated in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. Using any controlled substance after completing an SCA may be aggravating \nconduct, but it does not create a separate disqualifying condition under the AGs. Only \nuse \u201cwhile granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position\u201d \nqualifies as a separate basis for disqualification. There is no evidence in the record to \nsupport that Applicant met that criteria. Additionally, I found that Applicant\u2019s marijuana \nuse ended in March 2022, before he submitted the SCA.  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana was frequent and was as recent as \nMarch 2022. However, this was before he completed his SCA. He used marijuana to \ndeal with his back-pain issues. Although using marijuana is not a proper or legal \ntreatment plan, his unique circumstances bear some consideration. He listed ways he is \nnow dealing with his back pain without using marijuana. While he did not provide a \nsigned statement of his intent not to use drugs in the future, he has ceased associating \nwith drug users. He documented his appropriate medical treatment and is committed to \nfollowing his medical treatment to deal with his pain issues. AG \u00b6 26(a) and AG \u00b6 26(b) \nboth apply. \nI also note in accordance with the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s clarifying \nguidance letter concerning marijuana dated December 21, 2021, I have considered that \nthe evidence here supports mitigation in the form of Applicant\u2019s stated reason for using \nand purchasing marijuana, his abstinence since March 2022, and his disassociation \nwith drug users. The guidance also states that violation of federal drug law remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of security clearance eligibility. (See ES \n2021-01529) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his reason for using \nmarijuana and his commitment to treat his medical issues by other means. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as\nfindings of fact. Additional findings follow.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old staff electrical engineer who has worked for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, for five years. (Tr. 30, 32; AE H) In 2006, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 31; AE C) In 2008, he was awarded a master\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering. (Tr. 31; AE C) He has been married for 14 years, and his two children are \nfour years old and eight years old. (Tr. 31-32) He has not served in the military. (Tr. 32) \nHe has held a security clearance for eight years. (Tr. 33) His resume provides a detailed \ndescription of his professional accomplishments. (AE N) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges on at least three occasions in 2011 and 2012, Applicant stole \nhis mother\u2019s or his father\u2019s Vicodin (hydrocodone) and then used the medication. In 2011, \nApplicant had two surgeries. (Tr. 43) He was prescribed hydrocodone for pain after both \nsurgeries. (Tr. 43) In 2011 or 2012, he took three hydrocodone pills from an old bottle in \nthe bathroom. (Tr. 43) The pills were prescribed for his father. (Tr. 43) He used the three \nhydrocodone pills on three occasions in 2011 or 2012. (Tr. 43) He took the three pills \nbecause he was coming off of his prescription for hydrocodone, and he believed he would \nfeel better. (Tr. 44) He had a valid prescription for hydrocodone on the first two occasions \nin which he used his father\u2019s prescription, and his father\u2019s prescription was at a lower \ndosage than his own prescription. (Tr. 44) He did not ask for his father\u2019s permission \nbecause he knew what he was doing was wrong, and he knew he would feel ashamed. \n(Tr. 45) He rationalized that he was borrowing the pills, and then later after he took the \npills, he elected not to tell his father. He took the third pill after his prescription expired \nbecause he was feeling a \u201cbit sluggish\u201d and wanted to feel better. (Tr. 46) \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2016 and 2017, Applicant was prescribed hydrocodone after two surgeries. (Tr. \n46) He complied with the terms of those prescriptions. (Tr. 47) On September 3, 2018, he \ncompleted an SCA, which asked two questions relevant to his Vicodin use: (1) \u201cHave you \nEVER illegally used or otherwise been illegally involved with a drug or controlled \nsubstance while possessing a security clearance other than previously listed?\u201d; and \u201cIn \nthe last seven years, have you intentionally engaged in the misuse of prescription drugs, \nregardless of whether or not the drugs were prescribed for you or someone else?\u201d He \nanswered, \u201cNo,\u201d to both questions. (GE 4 at 45) He failed to disclose any misuse of \nVicodin on this SCA. (Tr. 41) Falsification of his 2018 SCA was not alleged in the SOR.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges, and Applicant admitted, in about October 2020, while granted \naccess to classified information, he used the prescription medication Vicodin \n(hydrocodone), th\n \nat was not prescribed to him. (Tr. 34) SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges and Applicant \nadmitted in about October 2020, he stole his aunt\u2019s Vicodin (hydrocodone) and then used \nthe Vicodin. (Tr. 35) In October 2020, he went to his aunt\u2019s residence to water her plants \nwhile she was away. (Tr. 55) He went to the bathroom and found a bottle of Vicodin. He \ntook four Vicodin pills out of the bottle. (Tr. 35) He was not thinking about his security \nclearance when he used the Vicodin. (Tr. 34) He was depressed and anxious because of \nproblems in his relationships with his spouse and parents, and due to isolation during the \npandemic. (Tr. 35, 53) He wanted to take \u201csome kind of mental health break.\u201d (Tr. 57) He \nused two Vicodin on two separate days. (Tr. 35-36, 56-57) He felt more relaxed; his \nanxiety was reduced; he felt a little dizzy; and he did not feel like doing anything after \ntaking the Vicodin. (Tr. 56) He did not drive or go to work after taking the Vicodin. (Tr. 57-\n58) He was mostly teleworking during the pandemic. (Tr. 57) He acknowledged that he \nmade a bad decision. (Tr. 35) He admitted what he did was wrong. (Tr. 37) \nEvery four or five weeks for the last three years, Applicant has met with a therapist. \n(Tr. 49; AE R) His support system has improved in the last three years. (Tr. 50) His \nrelationships with his spouse and brother have improved. (Tr. 51) On April 3, 2023, a \nlicensed social worker provided a chemical dependency assessment of Applicant. (AE A) \nThe social worker said: \nEven though [Applicant\u2019s] past use of pain medication is alarming and very \nserious in nature, given he has not used any opioids in the past 24 months, \nI have very few concerns about the limited scope of medication abuse he \nacknowledged. Having carefully considered the drug use he was willing to \nadmit to and the nature by which this substance abuse has been revealed, \nthere are no substance abuse-focused treatment intervention that I feel are \nessential for [Applicant\u2019s] situation at this time. \n \n* * * \nWithout any basis for a DSM-5 alcohol or substance use disorder, I have no \ntreatment recommendations for [Applicant] at this time. (AE A at 2-3) \nIn March 2023, Applicant told his aunt about taking her Vicodin pills. (Tr. 36-37) \nShe did not notice the pills were missing.

(Tr. 38) He does not intend to use \nVicodin in the future because he believed his Vicodin use was unhealthy and contrary to \nthe best interests of his family and career. (Tr. 38) \nApplicant has gone to counseling and concluded that his relationship with his \nparents is over. (Tr. 39) Applicant and his spouse disagree with his parents\u2019 political \nviews. (Tr. 52) His parents tend to lecture their children about why their political beliefs \nare erroneous. (Tr. 52) Applicant is more mature now than he was in 2020. (Tr. 39) He \nrelies on coping mechanisms he has learned and on his faith to \u201clive every day with \npurpose.\u201d (Tr. 39-40) \nIn his August 5, 2022 SCA, Applicant said he did not misuse prescription drugs; \nhowever, in the comments he said he took four Vicodin pills from his aunt while \nhousesitting. (GE 1) He indicated in his SCA that he did not believe this conduct raised a \nsecurity concern. (GE 1) In his response to DOHA interrogatories, he disclosed that he \ntook a few Vicodin pills from his parents in the second half of 2011 and the first three \nmonths of 2012. (GE 2) \nThe reason Applicant answered, \u201cNo,\u201d on his SCA was because he was in denial \nabout the seriousness of his misuse of Vicodin. (Tr. 41; GE 2 at 8) However, he wanted \nto have a clean conscience and elected to disclose the misuse of the Vicodin on his SCA. \n(Tr. 41) \nOn March 22, 2023, Applicant provided a statement in which he promised to \u201cnever \nuse or abuse non-prescribed drugs or any other drugs in the future.\u201d (AE B) He continued, \n\u201cIf I fail to adhere to this statement, I consent to automatic revocation of my security \nclearance.\u201d (AE B) He does not associate with users of illegal drugs. (GE 2 at 8) \nOn July 21, 2023, Applicant provided a hair sample, which tested negative for the \npresence of evidence of illegal drug use. (AE O) \u201cHair drug testing can typically detect \ndrug use up to 90 days in the past\u201d starting seven to ten days after use. (Id.) \nOn August 17, 2023, a psychologist evaluated Appellant\u2019s mental health. (AE S) \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant \u201cdoes not present with evidence of behavioral \nor personality patterns, or mental health conditions that could reasonably degrade his \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment in the context of protecting classified information \nand/or working in a cleared settling.\u201d (AE S at 8) \nApplicant has not violated the terms of any prescriptions for use of drugs or used \nsomeone else\u2019s prescription drugs after October 2020. (Tr. 47-48) He assured he will not \nviolate the terms of prescription for use of drugs in the future because violating rules for \ntaking prescription drugs made him feel terrible, and he wants to be able to provide for \nhis family and avoid possible adverse health effects.

(AE G; AE J; AE M) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f). Additional discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nApplicant admitted that he possessed and used hydrocodone under the brand \nname Vicodin without a prescription four times in the 2011 to 2012 time period and three \ntimes in October 2020. In his response to SOR \u00b6 1.a, he admitted that he had access to \nclassified information when he used hydrocodone, although he said he did not use \nhydrocodone at work. \nPossession of a Schedule II controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Hydrocodone is a Schedule II controlled substance. See \nDrug Enforcement Administration listing. (GE 3) \u201cHydrocodone is an antitussive (cough \nsuppressant) and narcotic analgesic agent for the treatment of moderate to moderately \nsevere pain. . . . Hydrocodone is the most frequently prescribed opioid in the United States \nwith more than 136.7 million prescriptions for hydrocodone-containing products dispensed \n2013.\u201d (Id.) \u201cHydrocodone is abused for its opioid effects. . . . As with most opiates, abuse \nof hydrocodone is associated with tolerance, dependence, and addiction.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s decisions to repeatedly possess and use hydrocodone are an \nindication he lacks the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets. He \nadmitted he used hydrocodone while having access to classified information in his SOR \nresponse. \nApplicant failed to disclose his misuse of hydrocodone on his 2018 SCA because \nhe did not believe it was important. He disclosed his misuse of hydrocodone on his August \n5, 2022 SCA in the comments section. He evidently did not believe that taking a few \nhydrocodone pills from a relative constituted an important security problem because he \nhad previously had his own hydrocodone prescriptions after surgeries. These two \ninstances of poor judgment were not alleged in the SOR. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at \n4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct \nnot alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId.

Oct. 26, 2006)). These non-SOR allegations will not \nbe considered except for the five purposes listed above. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. His most recent \nhydrocodone use was in October 2020, which is not recent, and there is no evidence of \nsubsequent hydrocodone use. He provided evidence of actions taken to overcome his \nhydrocodone involvement. He attributed his hydrocodone misuse in October 2020 to \ndepression, anxiety, the pandemic, and marital problems. He attended counseling which \naddressed his mental-health issues. He received a favorable recommendation from a \npsychologist and social worker. He provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement \nor misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. He does not associate \nwith users of illegal drugs. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for not disclosing his misuse of hydrocodone on his 2018 \nSCA and failure to more fully disclose it on his 2022 SCA were that he did not believe it \nwas important or a serious security concern. This explanation was sincere and candid but \nmistaken. He was not attempting to deceive or conceal his misuse of hydrocodone. He \nnow recognizes that theft of hydrocodone and misuse of hydrocodone is a serious security \nconcern. I believe he will scrupulously endeavor to disclose information requested by \nsecurity officials in the future. \nI am convinced Applicant\u2019s hydrocodone possession and use \u201chappened under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). His hydrocodone involvement \ndoes not \u201ccast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d (Id.) \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. Guideline H security concerns are mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 has two disqualifying conditions that are relevant in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) \nand 16(e)(1) read: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing . . . . \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3) and 16(e)(1) apply to Applicant\u2019s theft of four hydrocodone pills \nfrom his father in 2011 or 2012 and three hydrocodone pills from his aunt in October 2020. \nAG \u00b6 17 includes five conditions which could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. The theft of hydrocodone, which most recently \noccurred in October 2020, is not recent. It occurred on two occasions, and \u201cit happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \n[his] reliability, trustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant received \ntherapy to address the underlying cause of his theft and misuse of hydrocodone. He \ndisclosed his theft and misuse of hydrocodone to security officials, and his family. He is \nnot vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old staff electrical engineer who has worked for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, for five years. In 2006, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree, \nand in 2008, he was awarded a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. He has held a \nsecurity clearance for eight years. His resume provides a detailed description of his \nprofessional accomplishments. \nFive coworkers and his supervisor lauded Applicant\u2019s contributions to his \ncompany. The general sense of their letters is that Applicant is professional, productive, \nreliable, trustworthy, and responsible. He received outstanding performance reviews. He \ncompleted numerous continuing education and training courses, and he received \ncertificates for achievement and completion for completion of the courses. He received \ncash awards, recognition awards, and recognition points for outstanding work on behalf \nof his employer. \nIn 2011 or 2012, Applicant took four hydrocodone pills from his father\u2019s medicine \nbottle, and in October 2020, he took three hydrocodone pills from his aunt\u2019s medicine \nbottle. He consumed the seven hydrocodone pills that he took without permission. He \nfailed to disclose the hydrocodone misuse on his 2018 SCA and to fully disclose it on his \n2022 SCA. His decisions to repeatedly possess and use hydrocodone not prescribed to \nhim is an indication he lacks the qualities expected of those with access to national \nsecrets. \nThe mitigating information in the analysis sections, supra, is more persuasive. His \nmost recent misuses of hydrocodone in October 2020 are not recent. The only evidence \nof his hydrocodone misuse was from Applicant\u2019s disclosures.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial consideration concerns.

He further claimed he learned lessons from the past and has moved on in a \nmore responsible and disciplined manner since his tax-filing incidents.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .

Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s multiple petitions for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy relief (viz., 1999 and 2013). Applicant\u2019s filing lapses and \nbankruptcy petitions raise trust, reliability, and judgment concerns about his current and \nfuture ability to manage his finances safely and responsibly. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s multiple tax-filing lapses warrant the application of three of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines. DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \ninability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and 19(f), \n\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns, or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted tax-filing lapses and Chapter 7 bankruptcy petitions require \nno independent proof to substantiate them.

His admitted tax-filing lapses and \nbankruptcy petitions are fully documented and create judgment issues over the \nmanagement of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing and payment \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified information or to holding a sensitive position.

While Applicant is entitled to credit for his \nwork in the defense industry, his efforts are not enough at this time to overcome his \nrepeated failures or inability to address his tax-filing and payment responsibilities in a \ntimely way over the course of many years. Overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good \njudgment have not been established. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nreasoned, good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the \nforeseeable future. More time is needed for him to establish the requisite levels of \nstability with his finances to establish his overall eligibility for holding a security \nclearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

The Government\u2019s documents, \nidentified as Items 1 through 7 in its FORM, AE A, and AE B, are admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 29 years old. He \nmarried in 2016 and divorced in 2018. He does not have any children. He graduated \nfrom high school in 2012 and he attended welding school from 2018 to 2019, but he did \nnot earn a degree. He worked part time as a dishwasher from June 2010 to June 2013. \nHe then enlisted in the U.S. military and served until June 2018, when he was honorably \ndischarged. He has worked for his current employer, a DOD contractor, since July 2018. \nHe has never held a security clearance. (Items 1-3) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has three charged-off consumer debts totaling \n$31,920. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant \ndisclosed his delinquent debts in his August 2021 security clearance application (SCA), \nduring his August 2021 background interview, and in his October 2022 response to \nDOHA interrogatories. His delinquent debts are also reported on three credit bureau \nreports from August 2021, September 2022, and March 2023. (Items 1-7) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are three charged-off credit cards with the same \ncreditor, in the amounts of $20,955, $6,925, and $4,040, respectively. Applicant \nobtained the credit cards in approximately 2013 and 2016, and he used them to pay for \nhis daily living expenses. He began to fall behind on his payments after his military \ndischarge in 2018, when he earned only a minimal income and the high interest rates \non his credit cards affected his ability to pay them. He stated in his SCA and during his \nbackground interview that he was paying off other non-delinquent debts so that he \nwould have more money to resolve his delinquent debts, which he expected to do \nbeginning in approximately 2022. In his response to interrogatories, he stated that he \nintended to also save money so that he could make lump-sum payments on his credit \ncards. He also stated that he was experiencing medical issues that further affected his \nability to resolve his debts. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant stated in his Answer that payment plans had commenced for all three \ncredit cards, and he was scheduled to pay SOR \u00b6 1.a monthly and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c \nbi-weekly. He provided documentation reflecting that he made a payment of $436 for \nSOR \u00b6 1.a in March 2023, and he made three payments of $66 and $51 for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.c, respectively, in February and March 2023. He stated that he adjusted his \npayment plans to have all but the largest of his three delinquent debts paid by May \n2025, and the largest paid by February 2027. (Items 1-4; AE A, B) \nApplicant described his financial situation as stable during his background \ninterview. In his response to interrogatories, he stated that his annual salary was \napproximately $72,000. He further stated that he purchased a home in March 2022 and \nhis monthly mortgage was $1,500.

He has not received any credit counseling. \n(Items 2-4, 7; AE A, B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying his \ndebts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are established. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his delinquent debts. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. His documentation corroborates his stated efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR \nCase No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require \nthat an individual make payment on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts \nalleged in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or \nshe need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant has a plan to address his delinquent debts, to include two that are not \nalleged in the SOR. His debts became delinquent when he was underemployed after his \nmilitary discharge. Once he had the financial means to do so, he set up payment plans \nto address his debts, and he commenced payments in accordance with such plans. He \nhas demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, and he now has the means to \ncontinue to resolve them. I find that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties do not cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns arising from his delinquent debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Answer) \nThe case was assigned to me on August 29, 2023. \nPre-hearing e-mails from October 2023 between myself, Department Counsel, and \nApplicant about: a) whether Applicant wanted a hearing in the case; b) submission of \ndocuments on her behalf by her bankruptcy lawyer; and c) whether or not this case could \nbe resolved or withdrawn before a hearing, are all included in the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. Ultimately, Applicant confirmed that she wanted a hearing. (HE I; Tr. 7) \nOn October 25, 2023, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for November \n13, 2023, by video-teleconference through an online platform. The same day, Department \nCounsel moved to amend the SOR on procedural and substantive grounds, as addressed \nbelow. \nPreliminary Matters and  \nAmendments to the Statement of Reasons \nLikely due to a clerical error, the original SOR referred to Applicant as an \u201cApplicant \nfor Security Clearance\u201d (suggesting she was seeking access to classified information), \nyet the case number, \u201cADP 23-00116,\u201d and the introductory paragraph of the SOR, \nreferenced this as an \u201cADP\u201d case (regarding access to sensitive, but unclassified, \ninformation). \nOn October 25, 2023, Department Counsel confirmed that he had received \ninformation from Applicant\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) that \u201cApplicant is being \nsponsored for a Secret security position, not a [Position of] Public Trust.\u201d (October 25, \n2023 e-mail). Accordingly, Department Counsel moved to amend the caption and case \nnumber of the SOR and replace the opening paragraph of the SOR with language \nregarding security clearance eligibility (as detailed in the text of the motion). (HE II) That \nmotion was granted in my e-mail to the parties on October 25, 2023. (HE III) \nIn the October 25, 2023 e-mail, Department Counsel also moved to amend the \nSOR by adding two new financial allegations, one concerning Applicant\u2019s pending \nbankruptcy filing, and one concerning a tax lien. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l). He asserted that \nthe motion was based on newly acquired evidence. On that basis, the motion was \ngranted. Applicant was given appropriate time to respond, and she had the right to request \na continuance of the November 13, 2023 hearing. (HE II) Applicant answered the two \nnew allegations on October 31, 2023 and did not request a continuance. (Answer to \nAmendment, HE II; Tr. 18) \nThe hearing convened as scheduled.

Applicant testified and offered Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through H. AE A-G were provided by her bankruptcy counsel on her \nbehalf, before the hearing. All of the exhibits were admitted without objection. At the end \nof the hearing, I held the record open until November 27, 2023, to provide Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional information. Applicant timely submitted two reference \nletters, which I marked and admitted without objection as AE I and AE J. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 22, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j, with a narrative \nstatement. In answering the amendment to the SOR, she admitted SOR \u00b6 1.k and denied \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is 48 years old. She and her second husband were married from 2007 \nuntil they divorced in December 2021, in State 2. They did not have children. She has two \nchildren in their 20s from her first marriage. They are in college, but their father is \nresponsible for paying for their education. Applicant has an associate degree. (Tr. 33, 46-\n47, 65; GE 1; AE H) \nApplicant and her second husband lived in State 1 until late 2017. She was \nemployed with a government contractor at a government facility in State 1. She left her \njob and they moved to State 2 for his job. In State 2, she had only temporary, clerical \nemployment. (Tr. 35-37; GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s then-husband lost his job in State 2 in about September 2019. (Tr. 37, \n47) They were offered jobs at military facilities in State 3. In September 2019, Applicant \nmoved to State 3 for a job, but he did not move from State 2. He told her he wanted a \ndivorce in May 2021. (Tr. 35-38, 47-48)  \nApplicant worked in City 1, in State 3, for two years, until September 2021, when \nshe moved to her current location in the same state. (Tr. 47-48) She worked for contractor \nA in State 3 until the Friday before the hearing. She worked full time and earned $34.79 \nan hour. On the day of the hearing, as noted above, she began a new job on the same \nbase, with a new employer. She received a $7 an hour pay raise. (Tr. 39) \nAs amended, the SOR concerns 11 alleged delinquent debts, discussed below. \nThey include federal and state income tax debts, consumer debts, a repossession, past-\ndue rent, and other debts. The debts are established by credit reports from November \n2022 and April 2023, and other record evidence. (GE 4, GE 5). In her Answer to the \noriginal SOR, Applicant admitted all of the debts, and said they were being resolved \nthrough bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.k) or were the responsibility of her ex-husband. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe debts alleged are due to Applicant\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s employment issues and his \nrefusal to address the marital debts. They also were not able to afford to live in State 1, a \nstate with high taxes and a high cost of living. They addressed that by moving to State 2. \nApplicant did not have steady work until she moved to State 3. (Tr. 63-64) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($11,392) concerns past-due federal income taxes, for tax years (TY) \n2014, 2017, 2020, and 2021. (GE 2, GE 3; AE G) Most of these debts were incurred when \nApplicant and her then-husband were living in State 1. They filed joint income tax returns \nbefore their divorce. They were making payments, but he stopped doing so. They found \nthey could not afford to remain in State 1, so they moved to State 2. Her then-husband \nrefused to pay the taxes or any of their marital debt. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t care,\u201d she said. They \ncould not keep up with the tax burden, and always owed $2,000 or $3,000 each year. \nState 2, where they moved, does not have a state income tax. Applicant has filed her \nfederal income taxes individually since the divorce. (Tr. 35, 40-41, 49-51, 53-55, 63-64) \nUnder their divorce decree, Applicant\u2019s then-husband (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) was ordered to \npay \u201cAll IRS past-due taxes.\u201d (AE H at 2) Even so, Applicant included the tax debts in her \nbankruptcy per her counsel\u2019s advice. (Tr. 34, 51-52; GE 6 at 31) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($599) concerns past-due state income taxes owed to State 3 for TY \n2020. (GE 2; AE F; Tr. 50) Applicant (\u201cRespondent\u201d in the divorce decree) was assigned \nresponsibility for any State 3 past-due taxes in the divorce decree, along with any debts \nincurred after their May 29, 2021 separation date. (AE H at 3, 6; Tr. 51-52) Her State 3 \ntax debt is included in the bankruptcy. (GE 6 at 30) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l is a 2020 state tax lien, for $3,309 in past-due state income tax debt \nowed to State 1. (GE 9) Applicant initially denied the debt because she was not aware of \nit. (Tr. 54) She then researched the matter diligently in the days before the hearing and \nlearned the debt was valid. She plans to include this tax debt in he pending Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy proceeding. (SOR \u00b6 1.k) (Tr. 32-33, 42-44) \nThe following SOR debts are all listed on credit reports in the record as past due \nand in collection status: SOR \u00b6 1.c ($161), to a communications company; SOR \u00b6 1.d \n($552), to an insurance company; SOR \u00b6 1.e ($315), to a lending company; SOR \u00b6 1.f \n($156), a gas credit card; SOR \u00b6 1.h ($2,137), for past-due rent; and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($63) \nand 1.j ($862), which are consumer accounts. (GE 4, GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($10,781) is the balance due on a repossessed auto. (GE 4, GE 5) This \ncar was repossessed after Applicant\u2019s then-husband lost his job in State 1. They could \nonly keep one vehicle so they returned this one. (Tr. 39,59-60) \nApplicant retained legal counsel and filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in April \n2023. She declared about $37,000 in liabilities and about $69,000 in assets. (GE 6 at 20; \nAE B) The bankruptcy payment plan was approved in July 2023.

(Tr. 58-60) All of the original SOR debts are addressed in \nthe bankruptcy. (GE 6) \nSince moving to State 3, Applicant has had steady employment and has not had \nissues paying bills. She attested that she has about $1,500 or $2,500 left over each \nmonth. She provides financial assistance to her parents. (Tr. 56-57; GE 6 at 43; AE J) \nTwo prior supervisors provided strong reference letters attesting to Applicant\u2019s \nprofessional performance. She has worked closely with representatives of other \ncompanies and understands the importance of protecting confidential information. She \nhas excellent record-keeping skills and is a highly valued employee. (AE I, AE J) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) . . . failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant and her then-husband fell behind on their taxes and other debts while \nliving in an expensive state. Their financial problems continued after they moved to \nanother state, after which he lost his job. Applicant\u2019s debts largely resulted from these \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant and her then-husband experienced financial problems when they were \nliving in a state with a high cost of living. They addressed that by moving out of state, in \n2017. He then lost his job. He also declined to take any responsible action to address \ntheir marital debts. Applicant had only sporadic employment when they lived in State 2. \nShe took an opportunity to move to a new state for work in 2019. Her then-husband \ndeclined to follow, and two years later, they divorced. She has been gainfully employed \never since. \nApplicant sought appropriate legal counseling and was advised to file Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. She is now under an approved payment plan of about $1,100 a month and \nhas been making regular payments. This arrangement is recent and is to continue for \nseveral years. All the SOR debts are covered in the bankruptcy. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and \n20(d) all apply. \nUnder their divorce decree, Applicant\u2019s ex-husband is responsible for the federal \ntax debts at SOR \u00b6 1.a (even though Applicant also listed them in her bankruptcy). AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies to that debt. All of Applicant\u2019s tax debts (state and federal) are also to be \nresolved thorough the bankruptcy. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nI also had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during the hearing, and \nI found her testimony credible. I find that her debts were largely attributable to her marital \nsituation, and are not likely to be repeated. She has acted reasonably under the \ncircumstances, and her financial issues are unlikely to recur and no longer cast doubt on \nher judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) also partially applies, though the \ndebts are ongoing through the bankruptcy. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern \nshown by her delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts as to her eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

The \nremainder was paid to his secured claims. No payments were made to his unsecured \nclaims. (Items 2-5, 7, 9; AE A, A(2)) \nApplicant filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in November 2019. He \nreported $110,000 in income for 2017; $101,920 for 2018; and $85,698 year to date for \n2019. He reported that three vehicles had been repossessed. He still owned the \nmotorcycle for which he owed $19,493 and another vehicle for which he owed $14,034. \nUnder Schedule D, Creditors Who Have Claims Secured by Property, the petition listed \na mortgage loan of $280,146 (the house was valued at $292,000), a $914 loan for \nfurniture, and the two vehicle loans discussed above. Under Schedule E/F, Creditors \nWho Have Unsecured Claims, the petition listed $2,662 owed to the IRS for 2013; \n$142,962 in student loans; $71,509 owed in deficiency balances for the three \nrepossessed vehicles; a $5,485 medical debt; and $4,301 for five miscellaneous \naccounts.

The report indicated that $4,950 was \npaid to his attorney and $310 was paid to the trustee. No payments were recorded to \nthe claimants.

He settled a $636 debt for $500 In May \n2023, which he completed through two $250 payments. In addition to the financial \ncounseling courses required for his bankruptcies, he has taken classes from a noted \nfinancial expert. His plan is to use that expert\u2019s strategy of paying the smallest debts \nfirst, and then moving on to the next one. He stated that he was working on a plan to \npay the $1,202 charged-off credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f). (Items 4, 5; AE A, A(4)-A(7)) \nApplicant reported his financial issues on a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) that he submitted in August 2022, and he discussed them during his \nbackground interview in October 2022. He reported on the SF 8\n 6 that he went on a one-\nto-five-day Caribbean cruise in January 2020. His most recent credit report indicates \nthat he owes more than $250,000 in student loans, and it is unclear whether he paid the \nback taxes that were reported in his bankruptcy petitions.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including bankruptcy filings and \ndelinquent debts. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to being the sole provider in a family \nwith eight children. He also noted a significant drop in income in 2013, unemployment, \nand health issues. Notwithstanding the fresh start offered by the 2015 bankruptcy \ndischarge, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in November 2018. He \nreported $104,000 in income for 2016; $110,000 for 2017; and $92,781 year to date for \n2018. Applicant had income, but he overextended himself. He bought three vehicles for \nhis children, then was unable to pay for them. The 2018 bankruptcy petition listed four \nvehicle loans totaling about $89,000. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe second Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was voluntarily dismissed because \nApplicant moved to another state. Had he been able to continue with that bankruptcy, \nthe result of this case might be different. Because his Chapter 13 bankruptcies were not \ncompleted, they had minimal effect on his debts. Applicant is credited with resolving two \nnon-SOR debts from the bankruptcy, but he still owes a number of debts that were \nreported in the bankruptcies, including the three debts alleged in the SOR. He owes \nmore than $250,000 in student loans, and it is unclear whether he paid the back taxes \nthat were reported in his bankruptcy petitions. \nIn addition to the financial counseling courses required for his bankruptcies, \nApplicant has taken classes from a noted financial expert. His plan is to use that \nexpert\u2019s strategy of paying the smallest debts first, and then moving on to the next one. \nHe stated that he was working on a plan to pay the $1,202 charged-off credit card debt. \nHowever, intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a \ntrack record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. \n11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant does not have a track record that would enable me to trust that he will \npay the remaining SOR debts. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that his \nfinancial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay \nhis debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) are \npartially applicable. None of the other mitigating conditions are applicable. I find that \nfinancial considerations security concerns remain despite the presence of some \nmitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He \nprovided proof that he recently established payment plans and initiated payment of the \ndebts for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.g; (2) demonstrated that allegation SOR \u00b6 1.i was paid; (3) \nasserted SOR \u00b6 1.j was a duplicate of the allegation to SOR \u00b6 1.i based on the credit \nreports; (4) SOR \u00b6 1.k was a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.d; and (5) admitted to the remaining \ndebts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h. In his Response, he provided his Federal and state tax returns \nfor tax years 2015 and 2020, as well as 2022. His admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 43 years old. He has worked for his sponsor since June 2022. (Answer \nat 1, Item 4 at 35, Item 3.) He is a high school graduate and has attended some college. \nIn March 2022, his wife of over 15 years passed away. They had two children, but one of \nhis children has passed away. The surviving child is in elementary school. Applicant \ncurrently does not hold a security clearance but has held a security clearance as recently \nas 2009. \nApplicant's various delinquent debts total over $52,000. He attributed his financial \nproblems to his wife's health issues of the past ten years; being unemployed from \nNovember 2021 until she passed away in March 2022; and being underemployed since \nJune 2022. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: past-due account placed for collection in the amount of $3,009. In \nresponse to October 2022 interrogatories, Applicant stated payment arrangements had \nnot been made and that he had not been making payments. In his Answer he provided \nan account history that showed his last payment had occurred in December \n2021 and that he had a payment schedule established. The schedule showed a payment \nscheduled for January 2023 and monthly payments of $31.34 through December 2030 to \nsettle the account in full. (Answer at 2, 6, 8-12.)

He cited his wife\u2019s deteriorating health for not filing his tax returns. (Answer \nat 1.) (Answer at 1.) \nApplicant stated in his Answer his wife had multiple serious health issues in the \npast ten years. She suffered a brain aneurysm back in 2017, which made her health \nsteadily decline for the next five years. He stated by 2021 she was on the \u201cverge of death.\u201d \nHe elected to quit his job in November 2021 to care for her. The job he left paid $160,000 \na year. His wife survived for seven more months. During this period his security clearance \nlapsed.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual \nfederal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). \nThe following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were primarily related to his wife\u2019s medical \nproblems. Prior to the March 2023 SOR he sought assistance to resolve his mortgage \ndelinquency. He started addressing his delinquent debts in January 2023, after he had \nfound employment. Besides addressing the mortgage delinquency, he provided a \ndocumented plans to resolve five SOR debts, which totaled about $35,457 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.b, 1.d-1.e and 1.g). He paid one debt, SOR \u00b6 1.i and disputed SOR \u00b6 1.j as being \nredundant to it. He disputed SOR \u00b6 1.k as being redundant to SOR \u00b6 1.d, which he has \nan established payment plan for. The credit reports support his argument for SOR \u00b6 1.k \nbeing redundant to SOR \u00b6 1.d. His 2014 Federal and state tax returns are unresolved but \nI am satisfied that Applicant's finances are now in order and that he will maintain his \npayment plans and continue his efforts to resolve his remaining tax issues. A little \npremature because you have not finished the discussion, and the last sentence in the \ndiscussion covers it. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required to \nestablish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a \nplan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. \nThere is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts \nsimultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant still has debts to resolve, but I believe based on the record his problems \nonly arose due to the illness to his spouse. As he recovers from her passing his efforts \nreflect a sincere intention on his part to address his debts. I find that he has a plan to \nresolve his financial problems, and he took significant action to implement that plan. He \nacted responsibly under the circumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nIt will take time, but I am convinced he will eventually resolve his financial problems.

He has never been married and does not have any \nchildren. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019. Based on his most recent security \nclearance application (SCA) he completed in April 2022, he was currently enrolled in a \nmaster\u2019s program. Since August 2020, he has worked for a federal contractor as an \nassociate reliability engineer. On November 2, 2020, he was given an indoctrination \nbriefing after he was granted a secret-level DOD security clearance in October 2020. \n(Item 3, Item 4, Item 6) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant has used marijuana from about \nOctober 2017 to June 2021. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) He has used methylenedioxy-methamphetamine \n(MDMA, or Ecstasy) from June 2018 to November 2019. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) He used cocaine in \nOctober 2019. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) He used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in May 2020. (SOR \n\u00b6 2.d) Applicant used marijuana in June 2021 while he had access to classified \ninformation after his secret-level security clearance was granted in October 2020. (SOR \n\u00b6 2.e) He admitted all of the allegations in his February 2023 Answer. He also stated that \nmost drug uses were experimental in nature and occurred infrequently while he was \nimmature and attending college. He believed his voluntary disclosure of his dishonesty to \nhis federal contractor employer in 2021 should be viewed in his favor. (Item 2) \nOn July 4, 2020, Applicant completed a SCA, as part of his employment process \nwith a federal contractor. Under Section 23 \u2013 illegal drug use or drug activity, he failed to \ndisclose his illegal drug use, as required. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) A background interview was not \nconducted as part of Applicant\u2019s security clearance investigation. As stated above, \nApplicant started employment with the federal contractor in August 2020, and he was \ngranted a DOD security clearance in October 2020. (Item 4, Item 6) \nIn about November 2021, Applicant applied for and was offered employment at \nanother facility with his employer. Applicant accepted the job offer, and then he contacted \nthe facility security officer (FSO) at his new employment location and disclosed that he \nhad used illegal drugs that he had not previously disclosed on his July 2020 SCA. \nApplicant told the FSO that he did not disclose his illegal drug use because he did not \nwant the adverse information to prevent him from obtaining employment with the federal \ncontractor. His last use of marijuana occurred in June 2021 after he had been hired and \ngranted a Secret security clearance.

The FSO also rescinded Applicant\u2019s job offer. (Item 6, \nItem 7) \nApplicant was asked to complete another SCA, which he did in April 2022. He \ndisclosed on this SCA that he had used marijuana approximately 10 times between \nOctober 2017 and June 2021. He used MDMA, commonly referred to as Ecstasy, four or \nfive times between June 2018 and November 2019. He used cocaine on one occasion in \nNovember 2019, and LSD on one occasion in May 2020. He stated that he had no intent \nto use illegal drugs in the future. (Item 3) \nIn September 2022, Applicant participated in a background interview with a DOD \nauthorized investigator. Applicant disclosed that he was working for his employer in a \ncurrent position that did not require a DOD security clearance. His last use of marijuana \nwas in edible form in June 2021, while he was employed and possessing a Secret security \nclearance. He understood that marijuana use, in any form, is prohibited by Federal law. \nHe told the investigator that he did not disclose his illegal drug use on his July 2020 SCA \nbecause he really wanted the job and did not think his illegal drug use was \u201ca big deal.\u201d \nHe reiterated that he does not intend to use illegal drugs again. (Item 5) \nApplicant submitted two character reference letters that were provided by two \nmanagers with his current employer. One manager stated that Applicant reported to her \nfrom August 2020 until June 2022. He displayed sound technical judgment and \nsuccessfully completed his responsibilities correctly and on schedule. She became aware \nof the DISS adverse incident report around Thanksgiving 2021. Applicant never exhibited \nany behavior that would cause her to question his credibility, or his ability to protect \nclassified information. She does not expect he will use illegal substances in the future, \nand she believed that when he initially completed his SCA in July 2020, he was still \nimmature. She listed that research has shown the pre-frontal cortex of the brain does not \ncomplete its growth until the early to mid-20\u2019s. This portion of the brain is responsible for \nreasoning, judgment, planning, and impulse control. The second manager stated that \nApplicant has been part of the quality engineering team since mid-2022. Applicant has \ndisplayed consistent discipline and a high commitment to the team\u2019s mission. (AE A, AE \nB) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides potential conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(f). Applicant has used illegal \ndrugs from about October 2017 to about June 2021. He used marijuana in June 2021 \nafter he had been granted a DOD secret-level security clearance and while holding a \nsensitive position. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nbeing used; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a long history of using illegal \ndrugs, to include marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, and LSD between October 2017 to June \n2021. He is aware that marijuana use violates federal law, DOD regulations, and his \nemployer\u2019s drug policy. Despite this knowledge, he used marijuana in edible form in June \n2021 after he was granted a DOD security clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough I appreciate Applicant\u2019s candid statements and his remorse in his \nAnswer, his long history of using a wide range of illegal drugs is troubling. He told an \ninvestigator during his September 2022 background interview that he failed to disclose \nhis illegal drug use on the SCA because he did not think it was \u201ca big deal.\u201d His decision \nto use marijuana in June 2021 also demonstrates that he does not yet possess the \nrequisite traits of reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment that are necessary for all \nDOD security clearance holders. His marijuana possession and use are over two years \nold, but I find that more time is needed for him to mature as well as confirm that he is fully \nrehabilitated. Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 describes the security concern about personal conduct as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes disqualifying one condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately failed to disclose his illegal drug use on his \nJuly 2020 SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns as follows: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAt the time Applicant completed his July 2020 SCA, he deliberately failed to list \nhis illegal drug use because he wanted to receive an offer of employment from the federal \ncontractor, and he was worried that listing his history of illegal drug use would prevent \nhim from being hired. To his credit, Applicant voluntarily disclosed his deception to the \nFSO following a job offer in about November 2021. His conduct, however, does not \namount to a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his July 2020 concealment of illegal drug \nuse. Over a year had passed since he concealed his illegal drug use, and he used \nmarijuana again in June 2021 while possessing a DOD security clearance. He provided \ncandid information on another SCA he completed in April 2022. His past conduct casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. None of the mitigating \nconditions fully apply. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E and \nthe factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has shown that his personal interests come first, even if his preferences \nviolate rules, laws, and regulations. He is aware that federal law prohibits marijuana use, \nbut he continued to use marijuana in June 2021 after he concealed his illegal drug use \non his July 2020 SCA and was hired by his employer. I find that his use of marijuana after \nhe had been granted a secret-level DOD security clearance in October 2020 is also very \nserious. He did not report his deception for over a year, and despite his voluntary \ndisclosure of illegal drug use when offered a new position in November 2021, his conduct \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \ndoes not support a finding that he made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his initial \ndeception in July 2020. More time is needed to demonstrate his successful rehabilitation. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case, I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and \npersuasion. He failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse and \npersonal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.e.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",
