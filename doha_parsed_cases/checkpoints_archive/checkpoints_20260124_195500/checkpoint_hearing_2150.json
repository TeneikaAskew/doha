She \nclaimed she had documented proof of interaction with a tax preparer she had hired to \nprepare the missing tax returns before mailing them to the federal and state tax agencies \nprior to the September 2021 hearing. No documentation was submitted. The settlement \nof the first commercial debt did not occur until: (1) after a lawsuit was filed; (2) after \nApplicant's wages were garnished; and (3) after she received the Statement of Reasons \n(SOR). Her claim of paying off the second commercial debt is unsubstantiated. The \nfinancial considerations guideline has not been mitigated. Eligibility for security clearance \naccess is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 29, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP, GE 1) for security clearance eligibility so that he could \nwork for a defense contractor.

The exhibit also \ncontains a personal subject interview (PSI) dated April 9, 2019 that she provided to an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). She agreed with and \nauthenticated the PSI\u2019s accuracy. The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the \nnecessary affirmative finding to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and issued her an \nSOR on January 4, 2021 detailing security reasons under the financial considerations \nguideline (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided her notarized answer to the SOR on February 3, 2021, and \nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me June 2, 2021. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 12, 2021, scheduling \nthe hearing on September 10, 2021. The hearing was held as scheduled. The \nGovernment\u2019s seven exhibits (GE 1-7) were admitted in evidence without objection. The \npages of GE 2 and GE 4-7 are numbered in the lower right hand corner. Applicant\u2019s five \nexhibits submitted during the hearing and six post-hearing exhibits were also received \ninto evidence without objection. The record closed on September 28, 2021. The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on September 22, 2021. \nFindings of Fact  \nThe SOR contains two allegations identifying missing federal and state tax \nreturns for tax years 2010 through 2019 (SOR 1.a and 1.b) that Applicant did not file, eight \nallegations (SOR 1.c through 1.j) identifying federal and state taxes owed, and two \nallegations identifying delinquent commercial accounts (SOR 1.k and 1.l).

That lien will be \naddressed in the whole-person section of this decision. Concerning the two commercial \ndebts appearing at SOR 1.k and 1.l, Applicant explained that no action had been taken \nbecause of low pay. (GE 1 at 38) \nIn her April 2019 PSI, Applicant confirmed that she had not filed the missing federal \nand state tax returns for 2010 through 2017. She indicated that she wanted to file the \nreturns but never \u201cgot around to it.\u201d (GE 2 at 8) She did not mention a social anxiety \ndisorder that stopped her attempts to file returns. She noted that she had made no \narrangements to resolve the federal debt but considered contacting a tax lawyer. \nRegarding the two commercial accounts, Applicant explained that she used the two credit-\ncards extensively while she was unemployed from September 2016 to March 2017. \nSurprisingly, her July 2018 e-QIP, shows continuous employment from February 2009 to \nJuly 2018. (GE 1 at 12-17) As to debt SOR 1.k, the collection agency had filed a civil \naction seeking a judgment. Applicant tried to enroll in a payment plan but the payments \nwere too high. (GE 2 at 9) She claimed that she was repaying the SOR 1.l debt in a \nmonthly payment plan. She presented no documentation substantiating participation in \nthe plan or resolution of the debt. She conceded making poor financial decisions earlier \nin her life like over spending and purchasing a timeshare in 2009. (GE 2 at 9) \nIn her September 2020 responses to interrogatories (GE 2), Applicant provided \na graph to show action taken on the missing tax returns. Though she provided no IRS \naccount transcripts, she must have obtained assistance from a tax preparer, since the \ngraph discloses years she owed taxes and years she was due a refund. The graph has \nfive columns. Reading the graph from left to right, in the second and third columns, she \nindicates that she \u201cfiled\u201d all missing tax returns, including missing tax returns for tax years \n2018 and 2019, on September 17, 2020. However, she explained on the next page of her \ninterrogatory responses that the returns had not been filed, only prepared three weeks \nbefore she submitted interrogatory responses, but she still had to mail them to the \nrespective tax agencies. (GE 2 at 12) The fourth column displays the amount owed or \n\u201creturned.\u201d The fifth column shows that Applicant owes federal and state taxes for 2012 \nthrough 2015. The sixth column indicates that no payment plan was established for either \ntax agency. (GE 2 at 11) The graph also does not reveal additional penalties and interest \nimposed for filing the returns after the deadlines. (GE 2 at 11-12) \nAt the September 2021 hearing, Applicant explained that even when she started \ndoing her own taxes at about 25 years of age (circa 2005), she was still receiving \nassistance from another person who abruptly stopped assisting her. (Tr. 27) Her inability \nto find assistance from another source caused her to stop filing tax returns. An additional \nreason is that she has an ongoing history of social anxiety that has frustrated her efforts \nto address her yearly tax obligations. (Tr. 27) She conceded that she had no legitimate \nexplanation for not filing the returns from 2010 through 2019. (Tr. 37) Though she \nprovided no proof, Applicant claimed that she mailed the returns during the week before \n3 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe hearing. The only tax returns Applicant filed were those for tax year 2020, which she \nfiled following the September 2021 hearing. The electronic transmission of those returns \nshows a federal tax refund of $193, and a state tax refund of $43. After the hearing, \nApplicant called the IRS information center and was advised that it could take up to 12 \nweeks to process the requested information for the other listed tax years. Applicant also \nindicated the state tax agency official could only retrieve Applicant\u2019s 2018 returns. (Tr. 28, \n31; AE 6, 10) \nApplicant settled the SOR 1.k credit-card debt for $5,000 following garnishment \nof her wages for a period of time that is difficult to ascertain from her testimony. (Tr. 29, \n54-56; AE 1) She claims that the SOR 1.l credit-card debit was paid off when her \npayments were completed, and before she received the SOR. (Tr. 53) However, she \nprovided no documentary proof as she had to establish that SOR 1.k was resolved. (Tr. \n56) \nApplicant was asked whether she had a budget. She replied that she had a \nmental budget that was not written out. Then she indicated that she prepared a budget \non her computer. (Tr. 50) Her definition of a budget was not spending beyond a certain \namount of money earmarked for spending. (Tr. 51) No written budget was presented. \nApplicant has never had financial counseling. She testified that \u201cI have never been really \nthe type to ask for help and I know that I should.\u201d (Tr. 51) During the April 2019 PSI, she \nindicated that she wrote a note to the OPM investigator describing her plan to resolve her \nsmaller bills first and then tackle the larger ones. Using that approach, Applicant \nsuccessfully paid off her car six months ahead of schedule. (Tr. 42, 52; AE 3) \nApplicant was asked whether she intends to ask for assistance in correcting her \ntax issues. Her reply was ambiguous but she knew that she could rely on her father who \nwas experienced in financial matters. He is cognizant of Applicant\u2019s tax predicament \nthough she had not formally asked him for help. (Tr. 57-60) \nPolicies   \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d   \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis  \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.   \nPaying voluntarily incurred debts in a timely fashion demonstrates good judgment \nand reliability. Filing federal and state tax returns on time every year also shows good \njudgment while accomplishing an applicant\u2019s legal obligation to comply with well-\nestablished rules and regulations, a key factor for those who seek security clearance \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19. The disqualifying conditions relevant in this case are \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax as required. \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 2018 e-QIP, her April 2019 PSI, her September 2020 \nresponses to interrogatories, her February 2021 answers to the SOR, and in her testimony \nat the September 2021 hearing, she acknowledged that she failed to timely file her federal \nand state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2019. Though she claimed that she could \ndocument interaction with her tax preparer and that she mailed the returns during the \nweek before the hearing, she provided no proof that those actions were taken. AG \u00b6 19(f) \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplies. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to the delinquent credit-card debts identified at SOR \n1.k and 1.l. \nAfter the Government establishes a case under the financial considerations \nguideline, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate \nfacts admitted or proven by the Government. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a nonprofit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file tax returns was not infrequent because no federal or \nstate tax returns were filed for tax years 2010 through 2019. While she provided tax \ninformation that showed the missing tax returns were prepared in September 2020, she \nnever provided documentary evidence showing that she filed the returns and paid the \ntaxes. The late filing after the hearing of only federal and state returns for tax year 2020, \nfollowing 10 years of not filing tax returns, infers that Applicant will continue to have tax \nproblems in the future. Her pattern of inaction continues to negatively impact her current \nreliability, trustworthiness and judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nTitle 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 indicates a failure to file a federal tax return is a federal \ncriminal offense at the misdemeanor level, irrespective of the tax liability. Applicant\u2019s \nlongstanding social anxiety does not excuse her repeated failure to file her federal and \nstate tax returns. \nOnly limited weight can be given to Applicant\u2019s unemployment between \nSeptember 2016 and April 2017, because she supplied contradictory information about \nthe status of her employment during the period. In addition, her unemployment during the \nperiod does not explain why she did not file the missing returns before she became \nunemployed and then after she resumed employment.

In sum, there are no clear indications that her problems \nare under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) provides some mitigation to Applicant\u2019s $5,000 settlement \nof SOR 1.k after garnishment of her wages. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not available to mitigate SOR \n1.l, as there is no independent documentary evidence showing the debt as paid. Nor is \nthe condition available to mitigate the listed tax allegations. While Applicant provided \nevidence of preparing her federal and state tax returns for the missing years, the only \nevidence of filing tax returns is for tax year 2020. She still has not furnished any \ndocumented information of paying taxes that she owes. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply to the facts of this case due to the lack of evidence \nindicating that the missing tax returns were filed. While Applicant filed her 2020 tax \nreturns, they were six months overdue. In addition, although the 2020-electronic tax return \nshows refunds are due, after the 2020 tax year is tabulated with the penalties and interest \nrelating to other listed tax years where no returns were filed, Applicant will probably owe \ntaxes. Filing late returns after filing no returns for 10 years, and paying no taxes, cannot \nbe mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(g). \nWhole-Person Concept   \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.   \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the guideline \nfor financial considerations and in the context of the general factors of whole-person \n7 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n                            \n \n  \n \n                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n___________ \nconcept. Applicant has known about her tax problems since her tax preparer stopped \npreparing her taxes in 2009 or 2010.

In her July 2018 e-QIP, her April 2019 \nPSI, her September 2020 interrogatories, and at her September 2021 hearing, Applicant \nwas put on notice and should have realized that her missing federal and state tax returns \nwere a growing government concern. In the past 11 years, Applicant has only filed her \nfederal and state tax returns for 2020, and this action did not occur until after the hearing \nin September 2021. Viewing the evidence in its entirety, Applicant\u2019s resolution of her 2020 \ntax issues and settlement of the SOR 1.k credit-card debt is insufficient to overcome the \nremaining security concerns raised by the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.j, 1,l:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

He presented sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate his \nhistory of financial problems or difficulties. Accordingly, this case is decided for \nApplicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non September 17, 2019. (Exhibit 4) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP. \nThe SF 86 is commonly known as a security clearance application. He provided \nadditional information when interviewed during a November 2019 background \ninvestigation. (Exhibit 10) Thereafter, on December 15, 2020, after reviewing the \navailable information, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, \nFort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was \nunable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR is similar in form and function to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of an offense. The SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 1, 2021. He admitted the factual \nallegations in the SOR; he provided a two-page memorandum in explanation; and he \nprovided extensive supporting documentation. Altogether, his answer consists of 34 \npages. He requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing before \nan administrative judge. \nOn April 30, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation, some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits herein. The FORM \nwas mailed to Applicant who received it on June 11, 2021. His timely reply to the FORM \nwas received on June 14, 2021, and those matters are admitted without objection as \nExhibits A \u2013 M. The case was assigned to me on August 3, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee who is seeking a security clearance for his \njob with a federal contractor. He works as an account manager for a company doing \nbusiness in the defense industry. He has held a security clearance in the past while \nworking in the defense industry and during military service. (Exhibit 10 at 12-13) He has \nbeen married and divorced twice. He has two adult children from his first marriage. His \nformal education includes a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in 2004. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes honorable military service on active duty \nwith the U.S. Air Force during 1995-1999. He has been continuously employed since at \nleast 2005. He worked as a systems engineer during 2005-2012. He next worked as an \naccount manager during 2012-2019. He began his current job as an account manager \nin January 2019. \nThe SOR alleges a history of financial problems or difficulties consisting of a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy case, filed in 2007 and discharged in 2012, as well as seven \ncollection or charged-off accounts in amounts ranging from $3,061 to $11,308 for a total \nof approximately $41,000. He disclosed his history of financial problems and provided \nan explanation thereof in his 2019 security clearance application. (Exhibit 4 at Section \n26) He admitted the SOR allegations in his answer to the SOR. In addition to his \nadmissions, the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case is established by bankruptcy court records \n(Exhibit 5), and the seven delinquent accounts in the SOR are established by credit \nreports from 2019-2021. (Exhibits 6, 7, 8, and 9)  \nApplicant attributed the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case to the fallout from his first \ndivorce in 2006. Married in 1993, Applicant and his spouse had two children, a son and \na daughter. The divorce was final in October 2006, although the petition for divorce was \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfiled in December 2005. Applicant explained that his spouse ran up several credit card \naccounts before she filed for divorce. The divorce was protracted. As a result of the \ndivorce, Applicant was required to repay marital debt as well as pay both child support \nand alimony. Given his income at the time, he was unable to meet his financial \nresponsibilities, and so he sought relief in bankruptcy court. \nA Chapter 13 bankruptcy case is also called a wage earner's plan, because it \nenables individuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their \ndebts in monthly installments to creditors over three to five years. The bankruptcy case \nrecords in Applicant\u2019s case show he filed a Chapter 13 petition in April 2007 (less than a \nyear after the divorce); the bankruptcy court approved the repayment plan in March \n2008; Applicant completed the repayment plan in April 2012; and the bankruptcy court \ngranted Applicant a discharge in May 2012. (Exhibit 5)  \nApplicant attributed the seven delinquent debts to substantial costs he incurred \nduring a legal dispute with his first spouse during 2017-2019. Applicant sought to modify \nthe child-support order since his oldest son was no longer a minor, and he sought \ncustody of his minor daughter as she wanted to live with him. His spouse contested \nboth requests. The case took nearly two years until it was concluded in March 2019, \nwhen his daughter was two months shy of age 18. The following month in April 2019 he \nretained the services of a firm to assist him in dealing with his delinquent debts. \nApplicant described the firm as a debt-settlement company, but that is not the \nfirm\u2019s business model. The supporting documentation with Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR includes the paperwork from this firm, which describes the business as assisting \ncustomers in the preparation of documents that may assist in removing inaccurate items \nfrom credit reports. The agreement signed by Applicant indicates the company will \nprovide services (1) to assist in determining if third-party debt collectors are lawfully \nattempting to collect debts and (2) to assist in the removal of inaccurate items from \ncredit reports. The consumer-services section of the agreement does not mention the \nterms debt settlement or debt consolidation.   \nBy entering into the agreement, Applicant agreed to pay an initial fee of $766 and \nthen pay a fee of $765.99 for 17 monthly payments, in exchange for the services \nprovided. Furthermore, in the client-acknowledgments section of the agreement, it is \nmade clear that the company is not in the debt-settlement or debt-consolidation \nbusiness. Applicant acknowledged, among other things, the following: (1) he could \nperform any of the services explained in the agreement without entering into the \nagreement; (2) the company does not settle or reduce his debt but rather assists in \ndetermining if creditors are reporting accurate information to credit reporting agencies; \n(3) the company is not a debt-consolidation or debt-settlement company; and (4) the \ncompany does not pay off his alleged creditors with the funds he pays, rather those \nfunds go directly to pay the company for their services it provides to him. I find that \nApplicant did not enter into a debt-settlement plan with the company but rather hired the \ncompany to provide services in the nature of credit repair. Without an opportunity to \nquestion Applicant, I cannot determine if he fully understood the agreement.   \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his reply to the FORM, Applicant provided reliable documentary evidence \nshowing that he settled the seven collection and charged-off accounts in the SOR. First, \nhe settled a $3,061 medical collection account with a third-party collector (who \nrequested the account be deleted) in May 2021. (Exhibit B) Second, he settled a $5,363 \ncharged-off account for the lesser amount of $1,984 in May 2021. (Exhibit C and Exhibit \nI at 3) Third, he settled an $8,271 charged-off account for the lesser amount of $3,300 \nin May 2021. (Exhibit D) Fourth, he settled a $3,563 charged-off account for the lesser \namount of $1,318 in June 2021. (Exhibit E) Fifth, he settled a $5,847 charged-off \naccount for the lesser amount of $2,338 in May 2021. (Exhibit F) Sixth, he settled an \n$11,308 charged-off account (that was pending a lawsuit) for the lesser amount of \n$6,900 in January 2021. (Exhibit G) And seventh, he settled a $4,413 collection account \nfor the lesser amount of $1,544 in May 2021. (Exhibit H) \nApplicant was able to settle the seven delinquent accounts (contrary to the \nadvice he was receiving from the credit-repair firm) due to a substantial increase in his \nwages from his current employment as compared with his previous employment. His \nwages in 2020 were more than $400,000, and he had more than $100,000 in a savings \naccount as of February 2021. (Answer at 4, 6) \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n1  Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nThe disqualifying conditions noted above apply. \nApplicant has sufficiently explained and mitigated his history of financial \nproblems. His financial problems were related to circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol; namely, his first divorce in 2006 and the child-custody and child-support \ndisputes in 2017-2019.

He entered into a court-approved \nrepayment plan, which he completed in 2012. As a result of the financial stress created \nby the legal disputes in 2017-2019, he sought professional assistance from what he \napparently believed was a debt-settlement firm. He wisely abandoned that firm\u2019s \nrecommended course of action when he received the FORM and took action to settle \nthe delinquent accounts. His settlement of the seven delinquent accounts qualifies as a \ngood-faith effort to repay his creditors. Unlike many financial cases I see, he did an \nexcellent job documenting his remedial actions. Moreover, given his recent, substantial \nincrease in income and that both his children are no longer minors, it is unlikely that \nsimilar financial problems will recur. Accordingly, the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts and \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

He is employed with a defense contractor as an Aircraft Mechanic II. He is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Applicant began working for his current employer in October 2019. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR identified seven delinquent debts totaling approximately $40,000. It also alleged that Applicant falsified his security clearance application by failing to list his delinquent debts. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to each of the delinquent accounts, but denies that he falsified his security clearance application.

He is married with three children. He has a high \nschool diploma and extensive military training. \nHe is employed with a defense \ncontractor as an Aircraft Mechanic II. \nHe is applying for a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment. Applicant began working for his current employer in \nOctober 2019. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR identified seven delinquent debts totaling approximately $40,000. It \nalso alleged that Applicant falsified his security clearance application by failing to list his \ndelinquent debts. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to each of the delinquent \naccounts, but denies that he falsified his security clearance application. Credit Reports \nof Applicant dated November 16, 2019; and August 31, 2020, confirm the indebtedness \nlisted in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 6 and 7.)  \nApplicant served in the United States Navy from May 1999 to May 2019, when \nhe retired. He received an honorable discharge. Applicant explained that his transition \nfrom military to civilian life was very challenging. He picked up a contract right after he \nretired, however, it only lasted four months. His current employer was ready at that time \nto hire him, but because Applicant was no longer Navy affiliated, his security clearance \nwas stopped and the reapplication process began again, this time as a civilian. The \nprocess took time. This delayed his start date with the defense contractor and he was \nwithout employment from September 6, 2019, to November 21, 2019. During this \nperiod, Applicant and his family lived solely on his monthly retirement check and his \nwife\u2019s limited income. Applicant was eventually granted an interim clearance as a \nclearance was necessary for the job. In total, following his retirement from the Navy, \nApplicant was out of work for about 75 days, which created enormous strain on his \nfinances. \nApplicant explained that during their 17-year marriage, he and his wife shared a \nbank account together. \nShe has always been responsible for taking care of the \nfinances including paying the rent, car payments, and other bills. They raised three \nchildren and supported a family of five. Applicant placed all of the credit cards and \nother debt in his name.

This created extra expenses and debt that Applicant was not expecting. \nApplicant states that during this period, he did not know that his wife was allowing their \ndebt to go unpaid, as she did not tell him. Eventually, with help from family, friends and \ncounseling, Applicant and his wife were able to work through their differences, improve \ntheir communication, and restore their marriage. \nBy then, however, they had \naccumulated delinquent debt that needed to be resolved. \nApplicant and his wife obtained financial counseling from the Navy Fleet and \nFamily Support Center, and will be receiving recurring counseling on a monthly basis to \nhelp with their monthly spending. They have been learning how to live on a budget, \nhow to check their credit report, and how to maintain good credit. Applicant was also \nadvised to contact each of his creditors and to set up a payment plan to resolve the \ndebt.  Applicant has done that and more. \nThe following delinquent debts were at one time owing: \n1.a. A delinquent military credit card account was past due in the approximate \namount of $100, with total balance owed of $9,469. \nApplicant explained that this \naccount is paid through automatic deduction from his retirement pay. These deductions \nwill continue until the debt is paid off. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n1.b. A delinquent debt owed to the NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION on an \naccount was charged off in the approximate amount of $5,000 with a balance of $5,884. \nApplicant has structured a payment plan with the creditor.

(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-OIP) dated October 11, 2019. (Government Exhibit 4.) In response to Section 26 \nconcerning his financial record, Applicant was asked a series of questions. Specifically, \nin the past seven years, has he had any repossessions or property voluntarily or \ninvoluntarily repossessed or foreclosed? In the past seven years, has he defaulted on \nany type of loan? In the past seven years, has he had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? In the past seven years, has he had any account or credit card \nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed? In the past seven \nyears, has he been evicted for non-payment? In the past seven years, has he had his \nwages, benefits or assets been garnished or attached for any reason? In the past seven \nyears, has he been over 120 days delinquent on any debt not previously entered? The \nApplicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d At the time he completed the application, Applicant was \ncurrently 120 days delinquent on some of his accounts. He should have answered, \n\u201cYES,\u201d in response to this question. \nApplicant explained that he knew he had some financial accounts opened at one \ntime, but at the time he completed the application, he thought that they had all been \nclosed, and that his wife had paid them off, or had been paying them. Applicant admits \nthat at one point, she told him that they did not have good credit, but provided no further \ndetails. \nApplicant stated that he did not intentionally falsify the security clearance \napplication. At the time he completed the application, he did not think that he was \ndelinquent on any payments. He answered the questions to the best of his ability. \nApplicant did not have a copy of his credit report at the time he completed the \napplication, but now realizes that he should have. It was not until his interview with the \nDoD special agent that it was brought to his attention that he had delinquent debts on \nhis record. It was at that point that he realized he needed outside assistance to help \nhim resolve the debts. Upon learning of these debts, he immediately began to work \ntoward resolving them. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s transition from the Navy, after a twenty-year military career, into \ncivilian life was difficult. It also took time to process his security clearance, which \nimpacted his delay in getting hired in the defense industry, and ultimately contributed to \nhis financial hardship. His one year separation from his wife caused unexpected \nexpenses and prevented him from knowing about his delinquent debts. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so  long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangement. \nSince learning of his debts from the DoD investigator, Applicant has been \ndiligently making payments to his creditors to resolve his debts. \nApplicant has \nsubmitted documentary evidence to show that each of the debts listed in the SOR have \nbeen or are currently being addressed. The documentation includes receipts, copies of \nchecks, billing statements, and/or a letter from the debt collector showing the payments \nhave been made. There is sufficient documentary evidence to show that he is resolving \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis delinquent debt. Applicant has provided a reasonable explanation for the delinquent \ndebts. Not an excuse, but an explanation, namely, his difficulty in transitioning from his \nNavy career to becoming a civilian, as well as the time it took to process a security \nclearance. The evidence is clear that Applicant understands the importance of paying \nhis debts on time, and in fact was not aware that he had delinquent debts until he met \nwith the investigator about his security clearance. He and his wife are now back \ntogether. They are receiving financial counseling on a monthly basis from the Navy. \nApplicant is paying his debts and plans to continue to follow his scheduled payment \nplans until they are completely resolved. Applicant is now in control of his finances. \nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, Applicant has established that he has \nacted reasonably and responsibly with respect to his debts and his financial problems of \nthe past are under control.  Accordingly, Guideline F is found for the Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nIn response to questions about his financial history, Applicant did not reveal his \ndelinquent debts on his security clearance application. Applicant explained that during \nhis marriage his wife always paid all of the household expenses and other bills. At least \none year of their marriage they lived apart in separate households, but still supporting \ntheir children. Applicant states that he did not know that his wife was not paying their \nbills. The delinquent debts listed in the SOR were debts that became delinquent during \nthis time. Since learning of these delinquencies, Applicant has taken major steps to get \nthem resolved. He has contacted the creditors, set up payment plans, and strictly \nfollowed the payment plans to resolve the debt. He has also obtained professional \nfinancial counseling that will avoid any financial problems in the future. This shows \ngood judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. These are necessary characteristics of \nan individual who can be entrusted with the national secrets. Applicant also knows that \nbefore ever completing a security clearance application in the future, he should obtain a \ncopy of his credit report. He has learned from his credit counselor how to do this. \nUnder the particular facts of this case, I do not find that he deliberately concealed his \nfinancial history from the Government. To the contrary, I find that Applicant has shown \ngood judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to access classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has provided \ndocumentary evidence to support his statements. There is sufficient documentation in \nthe record to show that since learning of his delinquent debt, Applicant has worked \ndiligently to resolve it. Furthermore, he did not deliberately provide false information in \nresponse to the questions about his delinquent debts. Due to a period of discord in their \nmarriage, he and his wife were living apart, not communicating, and he was not aware \nthat some bills were not being paid. Since then, each of these debts have been \naddressed. Accordingly, Applicant has demonstrated that he is financially responsible \nand sufficiently trustworthy to access classified information. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g.:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 53, is married with one adult child. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1991 and a master\u2019s degree is 1996. He received a Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) phase 1 diploma in 2005. He served the U.S military in multiple branches, including the Navy and the Army National Guard, from June 1986 through June 2013, when he transferred to the retired list as a reservist for the Army National Guard. A defense contractor offered him a position as a manufacturing engineer in May 2019, dependent on him being granted the security clearance for which his 2019 SCA is pending. He previously maintained a security clearance in connection with his military service. (Item 3; Item 8 at 1, 6, 7) Applicant worked as an aviation instructor from July 2013 through November 2015.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 29, 2019. On \nJanuary 4, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The DCSA CAF acted under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 8, 2021, and requested a decision on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. On April 28, 2021, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \nevidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 8.

The case was assigned to me on July 23, 2021. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItems 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 8 are admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer included evidentiary documents that I admitted \ninto evidence as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. Item 8 was not authenticated as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 8. \nThe Government included in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his \nright to object to the admissibility of Item 8 on the ground that it was not authenticated. \nApplicant was also notified that if he did not raise an objection to Item 8 in his response \nto the FORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered to have \nwaived any such objection, and that Item 8 could be considered as evidence in his \ncase. Applicant did not respond to the FORM or object to Item 8. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 53, is married with one adult child. He received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 1991 and a master\u2019s degree is 1996. He received a Joint Professional Military \nEducation (JPME) phase 1 diploma in 2005. He served the U.S military in multiple \nbranches, including the Navy and the Army National Guard, from June 1986 through \nJune 2013, when he transferred to the retired list as a reservist for the Army National \nGuard. A defense contractor offered him a position as a manufacturing engineer in May \n2019, dependent on him being granted the security clearance for which his 2019 SCA is \npending. He previously maintained a security clearance in connection with his military \nservice. (Item 3; Item 8 at 1, 6, 7) \nApplicant worked as an aviation instructor from July 2013 through November \n2015. He worked as a pilot for various private airlines between November 2015 and \nFebruary 2019 except for the following periods of unemployment (which followed his \nvoluntary resignations): two months in 2016, one month in 2018, and two months in \nearly 2019 before being offered the position in May 2019. Applicant\u2019s current \nemployment status is not indicated in the record. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged four delinquent debts totaling $30,624, including a $25,338 \ncredit-card debt, a $4,190 apartment-rental debt, and two medical debts totaling $1,101. \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied each of the alleged debts. However, the debts \nwere confirmed by his credit reports dated July 2019 and January 2020. (Items 2, 4-6) \nApplicant fell behind in his payments on two credit-card accounts in 2011, with \napproximate balances of $2,000 and $25,000.

He did not specify details underlying his fraud claim or the amount he \nagreed that he owed. He also claimed that he consulted an attorney who advised that, \nafter a certain number of years, Applicant could not be held liable for the debt. The \nattorney warned that even one small payment could reset the statute of limitations clock \nand trigger an extension of the time that the creditor could pursue him legally for the \ndebt. Based on this advice, Applicant decided not to pay the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nHe did not proffer any documents corroborating his claims. (Item 3 at 78-80; Item 8 at 7) \nIn 2013, a person making a repair damaged a sprinkler head, which caused \nflooding in Applicant\u2019s apartment. The flooding damaged the carpet and its padding, \nupon which mold began to grow. The managing agent for the property owner refused to \nrepair the damages. After Applicant researched his options, he decided to default on his \nlease, which he believed was an available legal option. He moved out of the apartment \nin approximately July 2014. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is the amount that Applicant \nwas charged for breaking his lease and for the carpet and padding destroyed by the \nflooding. Applicant is not willing to pay this debt because he does not believe that he is \nlegally responsible for paying it. He provided pictures of his then recently flooded \napartment, including three commercial dehumidifiers that were running. However, he did \nnot proffer evidence of actions he has taken to resolve the issue with either the \nmanaging agent or the property owner. (Item 3 at 80-81; Item 8 at 7-8; Item 7) \nApplicant is not sure to what expenses the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nand 1.d refer. He believes one of the debts could relate to a medical bill he incurred in \nconnection with a 2017 car accident. His health insurance paid most of the expenses \nrelated to the accident and he received a small settlement from the at-fault driver\u2019s \ninsurance company. However, he had one medical bill (the amount of which he did not \nrecall) that he was waiting to pay once he received the insurance settlement. When he \ntried to pay that bill, he was told that the account had been sold to another creditor. He \nnever paid that bill because he was unable to locate the new creditor. He believes that \none of the two debts could be that account. In August 2019, he told a DOD investigator \nthat he would try to research the two medical debts and pay them if he is able to \ndetermine who to pay. Applicant did not proffer any documents corroborating his claims \nabout the medical bill he attributed to his 2017 car accident or any efforts he made to \nresolve either debt. (Item 8 at 8) \nIn his August 2019 security clearance interview, Applicant characterized his \nfinancial situation as doing great. He stated that he was willing and able to pay his \nfinancial obligations and any delinquent debts for which he believed he was responsible. \nHe was not planning on experiencing any financial difficulties in the future. At that point, \nhe managed his finances by paying cash or using his debit card for most purchases. He \nmaintained one active credit card, but tried not to use it. He stated that he had not \nreceived any financial counseling. (Item 8 at 8) \nIn his February 2021 SOR answer, Applicant indicated that he had engaged the \nservices of a law firm to \u201cremove all inaccurate information\u201d from his credit report.

Applicant planned to \u201cchallenge and fight inaccurate \ninformation\u201d on his credit reports.

(Item 2; AE A) \nNone of the SOR debts appeared on either his February 2021 or April 2021 \ncredit report. The April 2021 credit report revealed: 1) three credit-card accounts in good \nstanding with balances of $2,660 (opened February 2021), $2,775 (opened November \n2018), and $46 (opened April 2014), respectively; and 2) an automobile loan account in \ngood standing with a balance of $44,747 (opened March 2020). (Items 2, 4; AE A) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant acknowledged that he could not promise that he \nwould never experience financial difficulties again. He feels fortunate and grateful that \nhe has maintained financial stability in light of the turbulent times facing the country. He \nrecognized that no one has a right to a security clearance and fully understands the \nconcern. However, he also asserted: \u201cIn no case would any financial difficulty cause me \nto betray my country.\u201d (Item 2) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money.

A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe delinquent debts reflected in the credit reports dated July 2019 and January \n2020 establish the following two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). \nThe following are potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has reasonable basis to dispute at least some portion of the amount \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b given the proof he provided of the flooding damage. However, he \nfell short of establishing AG \u00b6 20(e) to mitigate the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. because \nhe failed to provide proof that he was not legally liable for the amount associated with \nhim breaking the lease or of his actions to resolve the issue with either the managing \nagent or the property owner. Because he did not substantiate a reasonable basis to \ndispute their legitimacy, AG \u00b6 20(e) was also not established to mitigate the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, or 1.d. \nApplicant is credited with resolving his $2,000 credit-card account in September \n2016, consulting with an attorney about the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and engaging \nthe services of a law firm to assist him with repairing his credit report. However, he did \nnot establish that either he or the law firm for him has paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.c, or 1.d. He also failed to establish that these debts were removed from his credit \nreports because he is no longer legally liable for repayment. The mere disappearance of \na debt from a credit report does not, without more, absolve him from liability. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough he proffered evidence of circumstances that were beyond his control \nbetween 2008 and 2013 and his car accident in 2017, Applicant did not establish that \nhis SOR debts were attributable largely to those circumstances or that he acted \nresponsibly to resolve them in the subsequent years. He did not proffer sufficient \nevidence of the efforts he made to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and \n1.d. Applicant\u2019s decision not to pay the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a demonstrates a \nwillingness to place his own self-interest above his obligations, which casts doubt as to \nwhether he may also act similarly in the context of his security obligations. Thus, in light \nof the record before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. The partial applications of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d) do \nnot suffice to mitigate the ongoing Guideline F concerns.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the fact that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c., and 1.d no longer \nappear on Applicant\u2019s credit report and may be no longer collectible due to the \nexpiration of a statute of limitations. However, the fact that Applicant failed to take action \nto resolve these debts (which were established by earlier credit reports as his valid \ndebts) during the time that they were legally collectible remains security significant. \nWhile the amount and type of debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d might not be \ndisqualifying on their own, they further underscore the overall Guideline F concerns, \nwhich Applicant failed to meet his burden of mitigating. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 32, has never married nor had children. He received a high school diploma in 2007 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He has been employed as a quality lead by a defense contractor since January 2018. Another defense contractor offered him a position as an avionics technician in August 2019, conditioned on him being granted a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) on September 3, \n2019. On February 10, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline G. The CAF acted under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 23, 2021, and requested a decision \nbased on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On April 7, 2021, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \npleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 9. He was given an \nopportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, \nextenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the \nFORM on April 28, 2021, and did not respond to the FORM or object to the Government\u2019s \n1 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on July 23, 2021. Items 1 and 2 contain the \npleadings in the case. Items 3 through 9 are admitted into evidence. I sua sponte \nappended to the record Administrative Exhibits (AX) I through III. \nAdministrative Notice \nThe record contained incomplete references to certain criminal charges by either \nciting only a statutory number or a short-form name. To ensure that the record accurately \nreflected those charges, I sua sponte took administrative notice of the relevant facts \ncontained in the applicable statutes and appended them to the record as AX I through AX \nIII. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 32, has never married nor had children. He received a high school \ndiploma in 2007 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He has been employed as a quality \nlead by a defense contractor since January 2018. Another defense contractor offered him \na position as an avionics technician in August 2019, conditioned on him being granted a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant previously held a security clearance while serving on active \nduty with the U.S. Marine Corps from 2012 through 2016. (Item 3; Item 4 at 3) \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged facts related to five criminal charges involving \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption between 2009 and 2017 including: two driving \nunder the influence (DUI) charges (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e), two driving while intoxicated \n(DWI) charges (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d), and one public intoxication charge (SOR \u00b6 1.g). It \nalso alleged facts concerning Applicant\u2019s 2014 alcohol abuse treatment (SOR \u00b6 1.c), his \n2016 service discharge for alcohol rehabilitation failure (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and his continued \nconsumption of alcohol through at least November 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). In his SOR answer, \nApplicant admitted each of the SOR allegations, without explanation. (Items 1, 2) \nIn March 2009, when he was a college student, Applicant parked his vehicle behind \na closed business with two friends as passengers. After deeming the vehicle suspicious \ngiven the location in which it was parked at a late hour, a police officer pointed a spot light \non the vehicle to find heavy smoke coming out of the driver\u2019s side window. As he \napproached the vehicle (in which its engine was still running), the officer detected a heavy \nsmell of burnt marijuana emitting from the vehicle. During a pat down, the officer smelled \na heavy odor of alcohol and burnt marijuana on Applicant\u2019s person. During a search of \nthe vehicle, the officer found two red plastic cups under the driver\u2019s seat that contained \nbeer. Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle under the influence of \nalcohol or drugs (OVI). While being processed at the police station, Applicant gave an \ninvalid breath sample (claiming that his asthma prevented him from providing a valid \nsample) and refused to give a urine sample (on the basis that the officer already knew \n\u201cwhat is in there\u201d). In July 2009, Applicant pled guilty to a lesser charge of having physical \ncontrol of a vehicle while under the influence for which he was fined $200. His father paid \nthe fine. (Item 4 at 12-13; Item 5; Item 9; AX I, II) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant was charged with any drug-\nrelated offense in connection with the 2009 incident. When questioned about the incident \nduring his March 2012 security clearance interview (SCI), Applicant maintained that he \nwas arrested because the officer observed beer in his vehicle, he had been consuming \nbeer, and he was in the driver\u2019s seat of the parked vehicle. He estimated that he drank \nabout two to three beers while parked. He did not mention marijuana with regard to the \nincident, but admitted that his only marijuana use occurred on the day of his high school \nsenior prom in April 2007. On that day, he tried marijuana twice; both times by smoking \na marijuana cigarette (about two puffs each time). He did not use marijuana again \nbecause it made him sick to his stomach and, at that time, he was concerned that \nmarijuana use would threatened his career in the fire safety program in college. During \nhis 2012 SCI, Applicant declared his intent not to use marijuana in the future because he \ndid not want it to affect his career in the Marine Corps. (Item 4 at 12-13) \nIn May 2014, while on active duty, Applicant consumed purportedly six to seven \nalcohol beverages with friends, while at an unknown person\u2019s home. During his drive \nhome, a police officer pulled Applicant over for erratic driving. After failing both field \nsobriety and breathalyzer tests, he was arrested and charged with DWI. He was also \ncharged with speeding, which was later dismissed. He spent one night in jail. In December \n2014, he pled guilty to DWI for which he was fined and sentenced to 60 hours of \ncommunity service and two years of unsupervised probation. Additionally, his driver\u2019s \nlicense was revoked for 30 days. He paid $515 for the fine and court costs, and \nsuccessfully completed his community service. The record did not indicate the status of \nhis probation. (Item 3 at 36-37; Item 4 at 5-6, 9; Item 6) \nAfter Applicant informed his chain of command of the May 2014 DWI arrest, which \noccurred off-base, he received a non-judicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15 of the \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The NJP resulted in a reduction in rank, \nforfeiture of pay, and 45 days of restriction. Applicant was ordered to undertake alcohol \nabuse treatment. Although he successfully completed that treatment in June 2014, he \nfailed to follow treatment advice to abstain from consuming alcohol and attend Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings. (Item 2; Item 3 at 28, 42; Item 4 at 5, 7) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted that he was treated for alcohol abuse in \n2014. He also admitted that he failed to follow treatment advice by continuing to consume \nalcohol and declining to attend AA meetings. The record does not otherwise address \nwhether he has ever been diagnosed with alcohol abuse or another alcohol use disorder. \nIn his September 2020 response to interrogatories, Applicant listed \u201cFit for Duty\u201d as the \ndiagnosis he received in 2014. (Item 2; Item 4 at 21) \nIn January 2015, while on active duty, Applicant consumed purportedly one 40-\nounce light beer, while watching a football game at a friend\u2019s house. He did not think he \nwas too impaired to drive home. During his drive home, a police officer pulled Applicant \nover for speeding. He was arrested and charged with DWI, driving while license revoked \nfor impaired driving (DWLR), and speeding. The facts and circumstances of his arrest \nwere not indicated in the record. In February 2015, he pled guilty to DWLR and speeding \npursuant to a plea agreement in which the DWI charge was dismissed. He was sentenced \n3 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto 45 hours of community service and twelve months of unsupervised probation, both of \nwhich he successfully completed. He paid $395 for a fine and court costs. (Item 4 at 8; \nItem 6; AX III) \nIn May 2015, while on active duty, Applicant consumed alcoholic beverages, in an \namount that he could not recall, while attending a wedding. He borrowed a friend\u2019s vehicle \nso that he could leave the wedding to get food from McDonalds. While Applicant was \ndriving, at approximately 2:11 a.m., a police officer observed the vehicle crossing the fog \nline several times with the passenger side tires. The officer pulled Applicant over after \nobserving the vehicle cross the fog line completely and drive partially in the grass. During \nthe traffic stop, the officer could smell an odor of alcoholic beverage coming from the \ndriver\u2019s side window. Applicant told the officer that he had not been drinking. The officer \nobserved that Applicant\u2019s speech was \u201cvery slurred\u201d and that he fumbled with his wallet \nwhen asked to produce a driver\u2019s license. When exiting the vehicle, Applicant staggered. \nThe officer could smell a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Applicant\u2019s \nbreath, and observed him to have \u201cvery bloodshot\u201d and \u201cglassy\u201d eyes. After Applicant \nfailed three field sobriety tests, he was arrested and charged with OVI. The officer noted \nthat Applicant\u2019s movements were \u201cover exaggerated.\u201d While being processed at the police \nstation, Applicant underwent two breathalyzer tests within four minutes. The first \nregistered a .197 blood alcohol level (BAC); the second a .207 BAC. He was also charged \nwith OVI with a breath alcohol concentration of .17 gram or more (OVI .17 Breath). At his \ninitial court appearance in May 2015, his driver\u2019s license was suspended until August \n2015. In September 2015, Applicant pled guilty to OVI for which he was sentenced to \nthree days in jail and fined $500. The OVI .17 Breath charge was dismissed. (Item 3 at \n37-38; Item 4 at 6, 9; Item 7; Item 9) \nThe record did not indicate whether Applicant received another NJP following \neither of the 2015 alcohol-related incidents. However, in March 2016, Applicant received \na general discharge under honorable conditions from the Marine Corps for alcohol \nrehabilitation failure. He maintained that his alcohol use did not negatively impact his duty \nperformance. However, he acknowledged that it negatively impacted his military career \nsince he was discharged earlier than his End of Active Service (EAS) date. (Item 3 at 41; \nItem 4 at 5) \nIn November 2017, Applicant consumed purportedly four alcoholic beverages, \nwhile at a bar with a friend. Applicant lost his keys and phone while at the bar and had no \nway home after his friend left him. After exiting the bar, Applicant approached a police \nofficer. The officer smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from \nApplicant\u2019s breath and body, and observed him to have bloodshot and watery eyes, \nextremely slurred speech, and an unsteady balance. Because Applicant was in a public \nplace with no party to control him, the officer attempted to call a taxi for him but was \nunable to reach one. Applicant told the officer that he did not know the phone number of \nanyone that could come get him. Based on his level of intoxication, the officer deemed \nApplicant to be a danger to himself and others. Applicant was arrested and charged with \npublic intoxication. He spent one night in jail. In March 2018, the charge was dismissed \nfor reasons unknown to Applicant. He believed that he did not do anything wrong. \nHowever, he acknowledged that he had been belligerent towards the officer during their \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ninteraction, but alleged that it was the result of feeling that the officer was harassing him \nfor crossing the street to use the phone. (Item 3 at 39; Item 4 at 6, 10; Item 8) \nApplicant\u2019s complete history of alcohol consumption was not developed in the \nwritten record. He could not recall when he began to consume alcohol, but described his \nalcohol use during several time periods. Prior to his March 2009 arrest, he consumed \nalcohol about two to three times per week, on weekends in social settings with friends. \nHe would drink about five to six beers each time, which was the amount it took for him to \nbecome intoxicated. After his March 2009 arrest, he decreased his consumption to about \none to two times per month; about two to four beers each time. As of September 2019, \nhe consumed alcohol every two or three weeks. From November 2019 through \nSeptember 2020, he abstained from consuming any alcohol. Without indicating a specific \ntimeframe, he reported that his consumption prior to November 2019 was one drink (beer \nor liquor) every three weeks. (Item 4 at 7, 12-13, 19, 20, 24) \nAt no point in the record did Applicant acknowledge having a problem with alcohol. \nDuring his 2012 SCI, he stated that he did not believe that he had a problem with alcohol. \nHe professed an intent to continue responsible use of alcohol and declared that he would \nnot drive a vehicle after consuming alcohol. During his September 2019 SCI, Applicant \nacknowledged that his alcohol use contributed to his legal, but not any other, problems. \nHe attributed his alcohol-related criminal offenses to having fun, being immature, and \ntrying to show off for his friends. He vowed to follow the law and stay out of trouble in the \nfuture by only having one drink and using ride-share services for transportation when he \ndrank outside of the home. During his October 2019 SCI, he attributed his May 2014 DWI \nand May 2015 OVI to being young and making dumb decisions. During his November \n2019 SCI, he reiterated that immaturity and wanting to have fun underlay his January \n2015 DWI. He affirmed that he would follow the law and prevent future alcohol-related \ndriving offenses by never driving after consuming any alcohol. (Item 4 at 7, 8, 10, 13) \nApplicant asserted that he last consumed alcohol to intoxication in November \n2019, and last blacked out in October 2017. From November 2019 through September \n2020, he abstained from consuming any alcohol because \u201cit was time for a change,\u201d and \nhe did not want to \u201cscrew the opportunity up [sic]\u201d to work in the avionics position offered \nto him, which he anticipated would provide him with job security and financial stability. In \nhis September 2020 response to interrogatories, Applicant indicated that he was \ncommitted to sobriety, asserting: \u201cI knew if I continued to consume alcohol I was likely to \nmake a bad decision, and possibly lose my job. I took a hard look in the mirror and realized \nI have a great career in Avionics, and don\u2019t need alcohol to sustain life.\u201d He also extolled \nthe benefits of sobriety, declaring: \u201cMentally and physically [it\u2019s] the best I\u2019ve felt in years.\u201d \nThere was no indication in the record that Applicant has either sought or received sobriety \nsupport from any individual, group, or resource since his 2014 command-ordered \ntreatment. (Item 4 at 19, 20, 23, 24) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s five alcohol-related criminal charges, alcohol abuse treatment, failure \nto follow treatment recommendations, and service discharge for alcohol rehabilitation \nfailure establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe recommendations that Applicant received following his 2014 alcohol abuse \ntreatment arguably indicated a serious alcohol problem. However, the record did not \nestablish that Applicant has ever been diagnosed with alcohol abuse or another alcohol \nuse disorder. Thus, AG \u00b6 22(d), (e), and (f) cannot apply. Nonetheless, the fact that he \nreceived treatment for alcohol abuse with recommendations to abstain from consuming \nalcohol and attend AA meetings remains relevant to the underlying concerns. \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 23 that could mitigate the \nconcerns under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol consumption spanned a period of more \nthan 10 years, from at least March 2009 (age 19) through November 2019 (age 30). The \nfacts and circumstances underlying that history demonstrate a pattern of questionable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment and cast doubt on his current reliability and trustworthiness. They also raise \nquestions about his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nWhile Applicant benefited from reduced charges in three of his four alcohol-related \nconvictions and a dismissal of the November 2017 charge, the excessive alcohol \nconsumption and poor judgment that underlay each incident remains security significant. \nThe concerns about Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related driving offenses are further exacerbated \nby their timing. The May 2014 and two 2015 incidents occurred while he served in the \nMarine Corps and possessed a security clearance, and after declaring during his 2012 \nSCI that he would not drive after consuming alcohol. Both 2015 incidents happened after \nhe received a NJP under Article 15, after he underwent alcohol abuse treatment, and \nafter he was advised to abstain from consuming alcohol. Both 2015 incidents took place \nduring the two-year period of probation he received for his 2014 DWI conviction; one while \nhis driver\u2019s license was suspended. The second 2015 incident occurred during the one-\nyear period of probation he received for the first 2015 incident. The 2017 incident occurred \nafter his service discharge for alcohol rehabilitation failure. \nThe fact that Applicant was able to abstain from using marijuana, which he \nrecognized posed a threat to his military career, but not alcohol, raises questions about \nhis ability to control his alcohol consumption. Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with \nrecommendations following his 2014 alcohol abuse treatment and the alcohol-related \nincidents that followed suggest that he had not yet either acknowledged or accepted that \nhe may have limitations with alcohol. While he reduced his alcohol consumption over \ntime, he did not stop consuming alcohol until two weeks following his November 2019 \nSCI. Applicant discrepantly reported that he had been consuming only one alcoholic \nbeverage every three weeks in the period prior to becoming sober in November 2019, \nwhile also acknowledging that he had last consumed alcohol to intoxication in November \n2019. \nIn September 2020, Applicant signaled that he was committed to continuing his \nsobriety, but there was no indication in the record that Applicant has either sought or \nreceived sobriety support from any individual, group, or resource since his 2014 \ncommand-ordered treatment. However sincere his commitment to sobriety may be, there \nhas neither been a sufficient passage of time without incident, nor a sufficient pattern of \nmodified behavior, for me to conclude that Applicant\u2019s excessive consumption of alcohol \nand questionable judgment are behind him. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis, \nand considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline G, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security concerns raised by his history \nof excessive alcohol consumption. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant did not mitigate the \nresulting security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse.

The adjudicative guidelines (AG) applied throughout the adjudication \nof this case were issued by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on December 10, \n2016, and have been applied in all adjudicative actions taken on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that was received by Applicant on April 12, 2021. The FORM contained four \nexhibits (Items 1 \u2013 4) on which the Government relies to support the SOR allegations. \nApplicant was informed he had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit additional \ninformation; however, he did not submit additional information or object to the admission \nof any of the Government\u2019s documents into the record. The record closed on May 12, \n2021, and I received the case for decision on July 20, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana between May \n2013 and at least September 2020 (SOR 1.a). It was further alleged that Applicant intends \nto use marijuana in the future. In response to the SOR, he admitted with explanation the \nallegation at SOR 1.a, but denied SOR 1.b, also with explanation. (FORM, Items 1 and \n2) \nApplicant is a single, 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

On March 20, 2020, Applicant completed a personal \nsubject interview (PSI) with a government investigator as part of Applicant\u2019s background \ninvestigation. During the PSI, he discussed his use of marijuana and disclosed additional \nmarijuana use as recently as earlier that month. He stated that he had purchased small \namounts of marijuana for personal use, and that he has never grown or sold marijuana. \n(FORM, Items 3 and 4) \nIn 2018, Applicant was diagnosed with epilepsy. He stated in his PSI that using \nmarijuana helps with co-occurring anxiety and helps him calm down. When asked to \nexplain why he continued to smoke marijuana after declaring in the e-QIP his intention to \nabstain from further use, Applicant stated that he would stop using marijuana when and \nif he received a security clearance.

In \nresponse to the interrogatories, Applicant disclosed that, after his March 2020 PSI, he \ncontinued to use marijuana through at least September 2020. (FORM, Item 4) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant disclosed that he suffered from epilepsy and \nanxiety. For those conditions, in November 2020, he applied for authorization in his state \nto use marijuana for medicinal purposes. His request was endorsed by a neurologist. \n(FORM, Item 2) \nSua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal \nlaw. Guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2013 makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the current National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, regardless of location or medical justification in his \nstate of residence, is illegal. Further, illegal drug use is prohibited in all federal workplaces \nand on all military installations by civilian federal employees and by persons employed \nfor work on federal contracts. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant has illegally purchased, possessed, and used marijuana since May \n2013. After stating in his e-QIP that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future, he \ncontinued to use the drug to at least September 2020. This information reasonably raises \na security concern that is stated at AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBy contrast, available information requires consideration of the following pertinent \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nDepartment Counsel presented sufficient evidence to support the SOR allegations \nand raise security concerns under this guideline. It thus fell to Applicant to present \ninformation that warrants application of any pertinent mitigating conditions. In response to \nthe SOR and the FORM, Applicant did not present information that would support any of \nthe aforementioned mitigating conditions. His use of marijuana occurred within the past \nyear and while his background investigation was being conducted. As for future intent, he \nhas reneged on past statements that he would abstain after December 2019. Further, he \nstated in his PSI that he would continue to use marijuana but would stop if and when he \nreceived a security clearance. Finally, Applicant has applied for permission in his state to \nuse marijuana for medicinal purposes. Although potentially legal under certain state laws, \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is still impermissible under federal controlled substances laws \nas well as DOD industrial security policy guidance. On balance, Applicant did not mitigate \nthe security concerns established by the Government\u2019s information. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline H, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Nonetheless, Applicant\u2019s past use \nof marijuana, as well as the likelihood he will continue to use marijuana, conflict with \nfederal government policies against such conduct. His response to the Government\u2019s \ninformation strengthens the doubts raised about his judgment, reliability, and willingness \nto follow rules and regulations regarding the protection of sensitive information. Because \nthe protection of the national interest is the principal goal of these adjudications, those \ndoubts must be resolved against the Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

The hearing was held as scheduled. \nI received four Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 4) and two Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE A and \nAE B), together with the testimony of Applicant. Also, I received a copy of Department \nCounsel\u2019s discovery letter to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I). At the close of the hearing, I left \nthe record open at Applicant\u2019s request to allow him the opportunity to submit additional \nexhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted 26 exhibits which I incorporated into the \nrecord as AE C through AE AB. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 16, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old single man with one child, age ten. He has been married \ntwice, and both marriages ended in divorce. Applicant is a veteran of the U.S. Army, \nserving honorably from 1987 to his retirement in 2008. He retired as a master sergeant (E-\n8) (Tr. 18). While in the Army, he supervised as many as 40 soldiers. (Tr. 27) When he \nretired, he received the Soldier\u2019s Medal, the highest award for heroism not involving the \nenemy. (AE T) He held a security clearance for his entire military career. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration in 2004, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in human resource management in 2005. (Tr. 25) Since 2014, he has \nbeen working for a federal contractor as a functional analyst. (GE 1 at 12) \nThe debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a is not a delinquent automobile loan, as \nalleged. Instead, it is a timeshare property that became delinquent in 2018, leading to its \nrepossession in 2019. (GE 3 at 3: AE E) Applicant paid the monthly payment through \nautomatic debit card payments. He contends that the account became delinquent after the \ndebit card expired and he neglected to switch the payment to his new debit card. (Tr. 49) \nHe recognizes that this was careless; however, he contends that he overlooked this bill, as \nhe was preoccupied with the expense and care of his elderly parents. (Tr. 41) Specifically, \nbefore his mother\u2019s death in February 2019, she required 24-hour, in-home nursing care. \n(Tr. 39) Before Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s death in January 2018, he required long-term care in a \nnursing home. These elder care and medical costs overlapped for several months until \nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s death. In the time before Medicare began reimbursements for these \nexpenses, Applicant became financially overwhelmed. (Tr. 41) \nOn April 21, 2021, Applicant contacted the creditor and negotiated a settlement for \n$3,885. (AE F at 2) He satisfied the debt through four payments made between April 21 \nand April 26, 2021. (AE F) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b stems from a contract executed by Applicant \nand a roofing company on July 19, 2014. Applicant agreed to pay $21,221 for a new roof. \n(AE A) That day, he contracted with another company to finance the purchase of the roof. \n(Tr. 69) Under a financing plan, Applicant borrowed the purchase price of the roof from the \nfinancing company and agreed to repay it through monthly $332 payments over 15 years. \n(AE D) Applicant was initially displeased with the high interest rate, contending that it was \nhigher than promised. Consequently, on July 21, 2014, he contacted the roofing company \nand expressed his intent to cancel the project.

(Tr. 54) Under the proposed modification, \nthe roofing company agreed to issue a $5,800 rebate to Applicant as soon as it received \nthe funds from the financing company. (AE A at 5; Tr. 56) \nApplicant agreed to the modification. (Tr. 59) Subsequently, after the roofing \ncompany completed the work, the payments were debited automatically from Applicant\u2019s \nchecking account to the loan financing company. (Tr. 59) Applicant did not receive the \n$5,800 from the contractor, as agreed, however. He reached out to the roofing company \nseveral times \u201cto no avail.\u201d (Tr. 69) He never sought a legal remedy for the alleged breach. \n(Tr. 69) Instead, Applicant stopped making payments to the loan financing company in \n2017, after having made payments consistently for three years. (Tr. 72) \nApplicant acknowledges that he should not have stopped payment to the loan \nfinancing company, and that instead, he should have pursued a claim against the roofing \ncompany for not paying him the rebate, as promised. (Tr. 72) Over the past year, Applicant \nhas contacted the loan financing company to resolve the delinquency. The loan company \nrejected his effort to renegotiate the interest rate. (Tr. 71-72) As of the date of the SOR, \nApplicant owed a $29,417 balance to the loan financing company, of which approximately \n$9,644 was delinquent. (Answer at 2) \nAfter the issuance of the SOR, Applicant contacted the loan financing company and \nattempted to develop a payment plan. (Answer at 2) A company representative told him \nthat the debt had been written off, and that he would be receiving an IRS Form 1099C for \ncancellation of a tax year 2020 debt. (Answer at 2) The IRS discharged the tax debt on \nAugust 20, 2020. (AE D) Approximately $20,986 was discharged, and this amount will be \nadded to Applicant\u2019s reportable gross income for the 2020 year. (Answer at 2) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c corresponds to the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.a. Specifically, it is a revolving timeshare maintenance fee, delinquent in \nthe amount of $591, with a balance of $4,229. (Answer at 2) As with the debt alleged in \nSOR subparagraph 1.a, Applicant had been making payments through autopay, but \ninadvertently stopped when he received a debit card with a new account number. (Tr. 72) \nIn March 2020, when an agent interviewed Applicant, the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a \nremained outstanding, and it was still outstanding nine months later when DOHA issued \nthe SOR. In March 2021, Applicant contacted the creditor to arrange a settlement \nagreement. Applicant satisfied the debt later that month. (AE G) \nApplicant did not focus on his bills between 2017 and 2019 when his parents were \nsick because \u201cbills didn\u2019t matter\u201d then. (Tr. 38) He knew this philosophy was wrong, but \u201cit \nwas family first.\u201d (Tr. 38) \nApplicant earns $153,000 per year. (Tr. 32) He receives a $1,600 net monthly \npension from the Army, and disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, \ntotaling $1,500 month. (Tr. 33) Applicant has approximately $19,000 deposited in a \nchecking account, $5,000 in four savings accounts, and a total of approximately $160,000 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvested in a thrift savings plan, a 401(k) account, and an e-Trade account.

He has approximately \n$130,000 in equity in his home, and more than $100,000 of equity in his rental property. \n(Tr. 102, 103) He has been making extra payments on his home mortgage in an effort to \nsatisfy the principal before it is due. (Tr. 100) \nApplicant has four credit cards. Their balances collectively total less than $100. (AE \nX through AE AA) He recently paid off his car note, and he is current on his child support \npayments. (AE J, M) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source . . . , and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems coincided with the deterioration of his parents\u2019 health \nand their subsequent deaths. During the two years that they were sick, they required costly \nnursing home care and medical expenses, much of which Applicant paid before Medicare \nbegan reimbursing them. Conversely, when faced with this financial crisis, Applicant \nadmittedly chose not to address his delinquencies, choosing to neither pay them, nor reach \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nout to the respective creditors. Moreover, after his parents passed away, he still \nprocrastinated and did not pay his bills until more than a year after their deaths. \nConsequently, although these circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control, AG \u00b6 20(b) \nis only partially applicable because Applicant did not act responsibly. \nApplicant has resolved the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c. His annual \nincome, including his disability pay, totals approximately $168,000. Additionally, he has \nmultiple investment portfolios and savings accounts, and he has approximately $230,000 \nof equity in his home and a rental property. He has satisfied his car note and he is current \non his child support payments. Under these circumstances, any negative inference \ngenerated by his failure to timely pay the timeshare debts and his failure to pay the roofing \ncompany before it was charged off and canceled is outweighed by his current financial \nstability. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn addition to applying the Guideline F adjudicative factors, I have considered the \nwhole-person factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although Applicant certainly should not have \nignored his delinquent debts when he was faced with the costs of caring for his parents, \nthis does not minimize the nature and seriousness of the family crisis that generated his \nfinancial problems. Ultimately, he contacted his creditors and began making payment \narrangements. Currently, the only unpaid bill is a debt that was charged off, reported to the \nIRS as income from a canceled debt. Applicant\u2019s revolving credit accounts are minimal, \nand he has ample income, savings, and investments to weather another financial crisis if \none arises. Given the presence of rehabilitation and the minimal likelihood of recurrence, I \nconclude that his finances pose no potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. \nIn reaching this conclusion, I also considered the length of time that Applicant has \nheld a security clearance, and the extraordinary heroism that he displayed which led to the \nreceipt of the Soldier\u2019s Medal when he was in the military. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 27, honorably served the U.S. Marine Corps from 2011 through 2015. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. In October 2019, she was offered employment by a defense contractor to be deployed overseas as an armed guard, pending the favorable adjudication of her 2019 SCA. She has been employed as a global security officer by a biopharmaceutical company since November 2019. She previously held a DOD security clearance in connection with her military service. (Item 3; Item 7 at 1) The SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling $29,056, consisting primarily of an automobile loan account totaling $24,741. In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted all but the following two alleged debts: SOR \u00b6 1.d ($592 collection account); and SOR \u00b6 1.f ($321 collection account). The denied debts were confirmed by her credit reports. (Items 2, 4-6) 2 In October 2017, Applicant financed the purchase of a car with an $18,882 loan. Her monthly payment was $520 per month. After she defaulted on the loan, the lender charged off the account in the approximate amount of $24,741 (as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a). She attributed this debt to an April 2018 accident, in which the other driver was at fault. Neither Applicant nor the at-fault driver had adequate insurance coverage. Although her car was deemed totaled, she remained liable for the loan. She engaged an attorney to file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 14, 2019. \nOn December 15, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DCSA CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 9, 2021, and requested a decision based \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. On April 21, 2021, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 7.

She received the \nFORM on May 4, 2021, and did not respond to the FORM or object to the Government\u2019s \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on July 23, 2021. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItems 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 7 are admitted \ninto evidence. Item 7 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nHowever, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 7. The Government \nincluded in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of her right to object to the \nadmissibility of Item 7 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also \nnotified that if she did not raise an objection to Item 7 in her response to the FORM, or if \nshe did not respond to the FORM, she could be considered to have waived any such \nobjection, and that Item 7 could be considered as evidence in her case. Applicant did \nnot respond to the FORM or object to Item 7. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer (Item 2) references an attached accident report to \nsupport the fact that she was involved in a motor vehicle accident in April 2018 with a \ndriver who was determined to be at fault. However, the accident report was not attached \nto the SOR answer. In the FORM, the Government noted: \u201cApplicant failed to actually \nattach the report.\u201d (FORM at 3). Applicant failed to respond to the FORM or provide the \nmissing accident report. However, I find that the accident report is not a materially \nrelevant piece of evidence. The absence of the accident report did not affect the relative \npositions of the parties or my decision. Accordingly, given that Applicant\u2019s SOR answer \nwas subscribed and sworn before a notary public and there was no contradictory \nevidence proffered by the Government or found in the record, I am able to make the \nfinding of fact without the need for a corroborating document. Thus, I conclude that \nthere is insufficient cause to delay these proceedings in order to obtain a copy of the \nmissing accident report. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 27, honorably served the U.S. Marine Corps from 2011 through \n2015. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. In October 2019, she was offered \nemployment by a defense contractor to be deployed overseas as an armed guard, \npending the favorable adjudication of her 2019 SCA. She has been employed as a \nglobal security officer by a biopharmaceutical company since November 2019. She \npreviously held a DOD security clearance in connection with her military service. (Item \n3; Item 7 at 1) \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling $29,056, consisting primarily of an \nautomobile loan account totaling $24,741. In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted all \nbut the following two alleged debts: SOR \u00b6 1.d ($592 collection account); and SOR \u00b6 1.f \n($321 collection account).

After she defaulted on the loan, the lender \ncharged off the account in the approximate amount of $24,741 (as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a). She attributed this debt to an April 2018 accident, in which the other driver was at \nfault. Neither Applicant nor the at-fault driver had adequate insurance coverage. \nAlthough her car was deemed totaled, she remained liable for the loan. She engaged an \nattorney to file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver. She continued to make her monthly \npayment on the loan until August 2018 when her attorney advised her to stop making \nher monthly payment pending final adjudication of the lawsuit. On a date not indicated in \nthe record, she withdrew her lawsuit after determining that the risks and uncertainty \nassociated with the lawsuit were not worth the costs of her attorney\u2019s fees. (Item 2; Item \n4 at 3; Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 5) \nIn January 2020, prior to her security clearance interview (SI), Applicant \ndiscussed with the lender various options for repaying the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nbut had not yet reached an agreement for a repayment plan. During her January 2020 \nSI, she anticipated finalizing the repayment plan within a couple of weeks and paying \nthe account in full by the fall of 2020. In her March 2021 SOR answer, Applicant \nadmitted the allegation, acknowledged that the debt remained unresolved, and advised \nthat she was working with her lender for a \u201cviable solution.\u201d She did not proffer any \nevidence corroborating her efforts to resolve the debt. (Item 2; Item 3 at 46-47; Item 7 at \n3) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a charged-off credit-card account in the amount \nof $2,226. This account was opened in 2012 with a credit limit of $2,000. During her \nJanuary 2020 SI, Applicant admitted that she used this credit card sometime in 2014 \nwhile deployed overseas to purchase a round-trip airline ticket to visit her family back \nhome. She acknowledged that she missed one or two payments while she was in the \nfield without access to a computer to make a payment. However, she claimed that the \naccount was paid in full sometime before her deployment ended in September 2014. \nThere is no proof of payment in the record. In her March 2021 SOR answer, Applicant \nadmitted the allegation without explanation or proffer of a repayment plan. (Item 2; Item \n4 at 5; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 3; Item 7 at 4) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is a collection account for a medical provider in \nthe amount of $1,073. The original creditor was the provider of an ambulance ride, \nwhich Applicant took as a result of her April 2018 automobile accident. In her March \n2021 SOR answer, Applicant admitted the allegation and stated that she is \u201ccurrently \nlooking for relief with [the U.S. Department of] Veterans Affairs to cover this medical \ncost.\u201d (Item 2; Item 4 at 5; Item 5 at 2) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is a collection account for a credit-card company \nin the amount of $592. During her January 2020 SI, Applicant acknowledged the \naccount as a credit card she opened with a $500 limit. She claimed that she closed the \naccount the same year that she opened it since she no longer needed it. She did not \nrecall being delinquent on the account (other than maybe by a week) or being contacted \nby the creditor for any past-due balance.

(Item 4 at 5; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2-3; Item 7 at 4-5) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is a collection account for a utility company in the \namount of $103. During her January 2020 SI, Applicant acknowledged having an \naccount with the utility company for electricity in 2015. However, she claimed that she \nalways paid her bill on time and denied that she owed any past-due balance. She \nplanned to investigate this account and start making payment arrangements if it is \ndeemed a valid debt. In her March 2021 SOR answer, Applicant admitted the allegation, \nbut claimed: \u201cThis was just brought to my attention via this notice.\u201d She did not proffer a \nplan for repayment or evidence of any efforts she made to investigate the debt. (Item 2; \nItem 4 at 4; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 1; Item 7 at 4-5) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a collection account for a cell phone company in \nthe amount of $321. During her January 2020 SI, Applicant acknowledged that this debt \nrelated to a cell phone she had and then suspended while she was deployed for eight \nmonths between 2013 and 2014. Upon her return from deployment, the creditor \ncontacted her about a past-due balance. She claimed that after she presented a copy of \nher orders, the creditor erased her past-due balance. She also claimed that she \nremained a customer, in good standing, of the same cell phone company for several \nmore years. She planned to investigate this debt and start making payment \narrangements if it is deemed a valid debt. In her March 2021 SOR answer, Applicant \ndenied the allegation and stated \u201cI am unaware of this charge.\u201d She did not proffer \nevidence of any efforts she made to investigate or dispute the debt. The debt was \nvalidated by her December 2019 credit report. It did not appear on her March 2020 or \nApril 2021 credit reports. (Item 2; Item 4 at 4; Item 7 at 4-5) \nApplicant disclosed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a on her October 2019 SCA. \nShe explained that the debt was \u201c[c]urrently being paid off in increments and a \nsettlement is in the process of being reached.\u201d She also stated that she was \u201cworking \nwith the creditor to pay off the rest of the loan\u201d and that she \u201cjust need[ed] a better \npaying career to help pay off the debt.\u201d (Item 3 at 46-47). \nFollowing her 2015 discharge, Applicant enrolled in school full time with the \nfinancial support of her GI bill and part-time employment. After obtaining her degree in \n2018, she has been steadily employed full time. Applicant did not proffer any details \nabout her income history. During her January 2020 SI, she characterized her financial \nsituation as being in an overall better place due to the income earned from the \nemployment she began in November 2019. She also asserted that the income she \nanticipated from her pending employment with the defense contractor would be \nessential in helping her to gain full control of her finances.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and her credit reports establish the following two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nApplicant did not meet her burden to establish the applicability of any of the \nfollowing mitigating factors: AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); \nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending \npractices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances); AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts); or AG \u00b6 20 (e) (the individual \nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause \nof the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute \nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to resolve any of the debts alleged in the SOR.

The fact that the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f did not appear on her most recent credit reports does not, by \nitself, absolve her from financial liability. \nWhile her 2018 car accident was a circumstance beyond her control, Applicant \ndid not meet her burden to establish that all of her SOR debts were attributable largely \nto that circumstance or that she acted responsibly to resolve them in the subsequent \nyears. Exacerbated by her failure to respond to the FORM, the record contains \ninsufficient detail and documentation about her ongoing efforts to investigate, dispute, or \nresolve her debts.

(Tr. at 17-21, 28-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A-C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana, including while holding a security \nclearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) are applicable. He indicated that he intended to \ncontinue to use marijuana. He no longer holds that position. AG \u00b6 25(g) was applicable \nat one time. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has not used marijuana since December 2016, almost five years ago. \nHe returned to competitive long-distance running in 2016, and marijuana use is not \nconducive to his training. He credibly and unequivocally testified that he does not intend \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. He does not want to jeopardize\nhis family or his job, where he is a valued and rewarded employee.  \n \nApplicant is remorseful and understands that illegal drug use is inconsistent with \nholding a security clearance. He fully disclosed his drug use on his SF 86 and \nthroughout the security clearance proceedings, which bolsters his credibility. His drug \nuse while holding a security clearance is troubling, but I am convinced it will not be \nrepeated. His conduct no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I find that Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate \nperiod, and that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate financial considerations concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information \nor to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 21, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 10, 2020, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

Applicant\u2019s post-FORM \nsubmissions are admitted as Items 8-10 without objection. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated four delinquent student loan \ndebts exceeding $32,000. Allegedly, the listed delinquent debts in the SOR remain \nunresolved and outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations covered in \nby SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c with explanations. Admitting only that he was not employed by his \ncurrent employer until October 2019, he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.d that his \nwages were garnished in October 2018 in the approximate amount of $680 bi-weekly. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 41-year-old program manager for a defense contractor who seeks \ncontinuation of his security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and \nadopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in June 2000 and divorced in May 2006. (item 4) He has two \nchildren from this marriage (ages 18 and 17). Applicant remarried in May 2017 and has \none child from this marriage (age 11). (item 4) He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nFebruary 2011 and a master\u2019s degree in June 2017 from accredited institutions of \nhigher learning. (Items 4-5) He also holds a Class A Barbers Certification, which he \nobtained in 2019. (Item 4) Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in March 2000, and \nserved six-plus years of active duty. He received an honorable discharge in October \n2006. (Item 4) \nSince October 2019, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nprogram manager. (Item 4) previously, he worked for other non-defense employers, and \nfor the past several years (i.e., between November 2018 and 2021), he has owned and \noperated his own hair salon/barber shop. (Item 4) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nAfter quitting his manager\u2019s job in October 2018 to attend barber school, and \nultimately to open his own hair salon/barbershop, Applicant began accruing child \nsupport arrearages for the two children of his first wife. (Items 4-7) On the issue of \nApplicant\u2019s court-ordered child support for the two children of his first wife, credit reports \nreveal that Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished bi-monthly, beginning in October 2019, to \naddress his current and arrearage monthly child support obligations (assessed to be \n$5,551 in the aggregate).

(Item 7) While Applicant expects some \nrelief from his child support obligations from a scheduled court hearing in April 2021, he \nhas failed to provide updated documentation of any cessation of garnishment initiatives \nor other achieved favorable results. (Item 8) \nAddressing his delinquent student loan obligation (calculated to be $19,835) \nreported in his credit reports and covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant acknowledged the \nreported debt but disputed the amount owed. Because he believes the reported debt is \nthe result of a miscommunication between his on-line campus lender over his claimed \nstipend entitlement and how it was to be applied, Applicant has continued to dispute it \nwith the credit reporting agencies and has declined to pay it. (Items 3-4) Applicant, \nthough, has never provided documentation to corroborate the basis of his dispute or \nfurnish copies of any dispute correspondence he filed with the credit reporting agencies. \nThat the debt no longer appears on his latest credit report is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate that his student loan debt has been since been canceled or is no longer \nowed. \nA third delinquent debt is covered by SOR \u00b61.c. (Item 2) This debt is listed in the \nSOR as a charged off $7,763 debt owed in connection with co-signing a vehicle loan for \na family member. When the family member failed to timely honor her payment \nobligations, the lender looked to Applicant to cover the loan payments. (Item 3)  \nApplicant, though, was unable to take over the car payments at the time and asked the \nfamily member, as the primary borrower, to expedite her due payments on the loan. \n(Item 3) To date, Applicant has neither corroborated his basis for his dispute of the SOR \n\u00b6 1.c debt, nor provided any probative evidence of either his family member or himself \npaying off or otherwise resolving the debt. (Items 3-8) This account appears as a \ndelinquent charge-off with a balance due of $7,763 on his 2019 credit report, and is \nreported as a sold or transferred account in his 2021 credit report. (Items 6-7) \nAbsent documentation from Applicant of his addressing his delinquent accounts \ncovered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, with pay-offs and payment plans, or successfully resolving \nhis disputes with the creditors of the debts he challenges, resolution of Applicant\u2019s \ndisputed accounts cannot be favorably established. Worth noting, Applicant\u2019s post-\nFORM submission provides no probative evidence of his initiating any voluntary efforts \nto resolve his debts. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These AG guidelines must \nbe considered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \n4 \n          The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.

AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \n \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability and good judgment in following \nrules, regulations, and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified ad \nsensitive information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at \n3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016; ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties associated with his child support arrearage and \nother delinquent accounts raise considerable concerns over his ability to manage his \nfinances in a responsible and reliable way.  \nExtenuating circumstances played a very minimal evidentiary role in Applicant\u2019s \naccumulation of delinquent accounts. Gainfully employed before quitting his job to \nattend barber school and pursue a career in the salon/barber field, he provided little \ninformation as to how this career decision impacted his finances in the short run while \nhe was in training, and why he did not address his delinquent accounts in a more \nmeaningful way after he returned to full-time professional employment in October 2019. \nWith so little financial information to work with relative to the circumstances prompting \nhim to fall behind with his child support obligations, student loan, and automobile \nfinancing, and later address them responsibly with the income resources available to \nhim from his full-time employment, no meaningful extenuation credit can be assigned to \nhim at this time. \nAfforded opportunities to provide clarification of his financial conditions and \nexplanations of his lack of payment progress on his delinquent debts, Applicant \nprovided no persuasive clarifications or explanations for (a) how he allowed his debts to \nbecome delinquent with his past and current income available to him and (b) why he \nllowed his accounts to become delinquent, and (c) why he has failed to take any \ndocumented steps to address his delinquent accounts once his finances had improved. \nAccount histories of Applicant\u2019s listed SOR debts are not sufficiently developed in this \nadministrative record to permit more detailed assessment of his managing of his \nfinances during the critical years in issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n                                \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFor lack of any documented repayment or financial counseling initiatives by \nApplicant, other potentially available mitigating conditions cannot be applied to \nApplicant\u2019s situation.

While Applicant is entitled to credit for his \ncontributions to the defense industry, his employment contributions are not enough at \nthis time to overcome his accumulated delinquent debts and his lack of a meaningful \ntrack record for dealing with them and maintaining responsible control of his finances. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n3 \n\n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

The concern under this guideline is \nset out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established.

The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and \nAG \u00b6 16(g): association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n5 \n \nBoth disqualifying conditions are established.

Applicant continues to associate with his drug-using \nfriends. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement \nand personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The case was assigned to me on June 3, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant has nine delinquent student-\nloan accounts totaling $139,859, and one delinquent personal-loan account of $1,139. \nApplicant admits each of the allegations. The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s \ncredit bureau reports (CBR) from February 2021, August 2020, February 2030, and \nOctober 2018, listed on his e-QIP, and discussed during his personal subject interviews \n(PSI). (GX 4 through GX 7; GX 2; GX 8.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant, 54, is a desktop support engineer currently working for a defense \ncontractor since August 2018. He received his associate\u2019s degree in 2015. He and his \nwife married in 2004. Applicant has two children who are 29 and 13. (GX 3.) \nOn his e-QIP, Applicant stated that he incurred the student-loan debts for his and \nhis daughter\u2019s college educations. He explained that he was working with a collection \nagency to pay the debts. He also listed three delinquent medical debts totaling \napproximately $776, two of which he was making monthly payments of $50 each, and \none of which he was working on setting up a payment plan. He explained that he incurred \nthese debts after undergoing various surgeries and was unable to pay the accounts after \nbeing laid off from his job. However, under the employment activities section of the e-QIP, \nApplicant did not list that he had been laid off by any of his previous employers between \n2004 and 2018. He did list that from July until October 2016 he was self-employed as a \nride-share driver after having left his previous employer by mutual agreement after being \nnotified of unsatisfactory performance. \nIn his November 2018 PSI, Applicant discussed his prior employment record, but \ndid not state that he had been laid off from any previous employer. He asserted that he \nhad entered a payment plan and was making monthly payments on his student loans. In \na follow-up PSI in January 2019, Applicant clarified that he had set up his payment plan \nin October 2019. His December 2021 CBR shows that Applicant made some payments \non his student loans, but none since April 2019. (GX 4.) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to having been \ndiagnosed with a chronic disease which required several surgeries and ongoing, regular \ntreatments. He did not reference any other cause for his financial difficulties, including \nhaving been laid off from a previous employer. He asserted that he had entered a \nrepayment arrangement that would begin on February 28, 2021. The terms of the \narrangement were that he would pay $701 per month on the consolidated total debt \namount of his student loans. However, there is no record evidence to support this \nassertion.

(GX 7.) The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.i remain unresolved. \nApplicant also stated in his answer to the SOR that he left four telephone \nmessages between December 2020 and January 2021 for the creditor of the $1,139 \npersonal loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j in an effort to arrange a repayment plan, but that \nthe creditor never returned his calls. This debt was assigned to collection in January 2018. \nThis debt remains unresolved. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 \n\n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s financial issues may have arisen due to circumstances beyond \nhis control, specifically his chronic medical condition, he did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant\u2019s student loans went into collection between 2010 and 2014 \nand remain delinquent. While Applicant made some payments, he has not made any \nsince 2014 and the balance on the delinquent student-loan debts is approximately \n$140,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a through 1.i). Although he asserts that he has entered another \nrepayment plan for his student loans, there is no record evidence supporting this \nassertion. Applicant\u2019s personal-loan debt went into collection in 2018. He did not attempt \nto contact the creditor until late December 2020, well after having received the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent, ongoing, and unresolved. Applicant is legally \nobligated to pay his student loans and his failure to do so raises concerns about his \nwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, and about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Applicant has not made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n5 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole-person factors set forth in AG \u00b6 \n2(a), I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts.

See before mentioned discussion, above, under Paragraph 1.  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant used and purchased Marijuana, Psilocybin Mushrooms and Cocaine \nbetween 1995 and 2017. He held a security clearance for his job during the last ten \nyears of that time. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these were established by the evidence in this case. Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant falsified his 2007 and 2017 SCAs. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \nNone of these was established. Personal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected at his workplace and in his community. (PHEs B and C.) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a.~2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 30, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 4, 2021. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on June 10, 2021, \nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on July 23, 2021. The Government \noffered five exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were \nadmitted without objection.

He has a high school diploma and one year of college. \nHe holds the positon of Communications Technician with a defense contractor. He \nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense \nindustry. \nParagraph 1 Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations   The Government alleges that the \nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 through 2017 in a timely fashion; and he is indebted to three \nseparate creditors totaling less than $1,000.  In his Answer, Applicant admits allegations \n1.a., and 1.c., and denied allegations 1.d., and 1.e., in the SOR. Credit reports of the \nApplicant dated August 11, 2018; October 17, 2019; and February 2, 2021, reflect that \neach of these debts were owing at one point. (Government Exhibits 3, 4, and 5.) \nApplicant served honorably in the United States Army from 1990 to 1993, \ncompleting a full enlistment period. \nHe served during Desert Storm and received \naccolades for his service. He is now a 30 percent disabled veteran. Applicant has \nworked for his current employer since February 1998, and has an excellent work \nhistory.  At this time, a security clearance is needed for his position. \nFrom 2014 through 2017, a number of traumatic events occurred in Applicant\u2019s \nlife that caused him to become depressed and unable to keep up with his normal \nresponsibilities. In 2014, his mother passed away on tax filing deadline day. Applicant \nimmediately became responsible for handling her affairs, including her funeral \narrangements, personal business, finances, taxes, and other estate matters. As time \npassed, Applicant became even more depressed and overwhelmed with everything. By \n2015, he was so stressed out that he could not even do his job. He filed for short-term \ndisability for a period. By this point things had spiraled out of control. Applicant had \nfallen behind with several bills and had failed to file his annual income tax returns. \nPeople in his life who normally helped him prepare and file his income tax returns had \nfallen very ill and were dying. \nTo further complicate matters, when Applicant relocated to Hawaii in 2018, he \nwas forced to move four times before he settled into his home. During these moves, \nApplicant lost the paperwork and information he needed to prepare and file his income \ntax returns. As time passed, things gradually improved. Applicant eventually prepared \nand filed his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2018, and 2019 in July 2020.

(Tr. p. 25.)  \nIt was also during this depressing time in his life that the following delinquent \ndebts listed in the SOR became owing. He has now settled and/or paid off each of the \ndelinquent debts set forth below. \n1.c. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent medical account placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $709.  Applicant settled the debt, and it is no \nlonger owing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)           \n1.d.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent medical account placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $241.  Applicant paid the debt, and it is no \nlonger owing.  (Tr. pp. 31-33.) \n1.e.   Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a delinquent medical account placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $60.  Applicant paid the debt, and it is no longer \nowing.  (Tr. pp. 31-33.) \nApplicant states that he has no outstanding delinquent debts. He is also current \nwith his regular monthly expenses. (Tr. p. 34.) Applicant\u2019s further states that his work \nperformance evaluations always reflect that he is a top performer. (Tr. pp. 38-39.) He \nhas been allowed to travel to different states to work. Applicant has worked in Colorado \nfor five years, Texas for three years, Georgia for ten years, and Hawaii for almost three \nyears. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:      \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.  Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAfter Applicant\u2019s mother died, Applicant went through a period of grieving. For \nseveral years he was unable to focus and perform his normal responsibilities without \ndistractions. During this period, Applicant failed to file his Federal and state annual \nincome tax returns for several years, and several debts became owing and delinquent. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant understands that no matter what challenges, crises, or obstacles he \nencounters in life, he cannot be financially irresponsible in the future. He also knows \nthat to be eligible for a security clearance he must file his Federal and state income tax \nreturns on an annual basis and in a timely fashion. He has now filed all of the Federal \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand state income tax returns in question. He owes no back taxes to any tax authority. \nHe has also paid off his delinquent debts. The stress and depression he experienced \nfrom 2014 through 2017, triggered by his mother\u2019s death, was an isolated incident. It \nhas now passed and will not recur. Applicant has now turned the corner in the grieving \nprocess, and has been able to focus on his responsibilities and get them accomplished \nwithout difficulty or delay. Applicant clearly understands the responsibilities that come \nwith possessing a security clearance. He has demonstrated financial responsibility by \nfiling his income tax returns, paying his taxes, and paying his debts. \nUnder the \ncircumstances, he has acted reasonably and responsibly, and has demonstrated good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The Financial Considerations concern has \nbeen mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: through 1.e. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s responses in his Answer, his testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 28 years old. He married in May 2021, shortly before the hearing. He and his wife have no children. In May 2019, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, summa cum laude, with a GPA of 3.96 from a prestigious university. He paid for his college expenses by working part time in a coffee shop while attending classes on a full-time basis. He also had a $10,000 student loan, which he paid off after his graduation. He received no financial support from his parents while attending college. After graduating from college, he began working for a DoD contractor in his \u201cdream job\u201d as an engineer and earns about $89,000 per year. His wife works as a web and graphic designer, earning about $52,000 per year. He and his wife are presently financially stable and are able to pay their current bills and save money every month.

He requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). He retained \ncounsel and his attorney submitted his Notice of Representation on March 31, 2021. On \nApril 30, 2021, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May \n28, 2021, scheduling the hearing for June 8, 2021, via DCS video teleconference. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented five \nproposed exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. I marked \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit I. In the absence of any objections, \nI admitted the Government\u2019s exhibits into the record. \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel offered 11 exhibits, marked as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through K. In addition, he offered the eight documents Applicant attached \nto his Answer. I marked those Exhibits as AE L-1 through L-8. They were admitted into \nthe record without objection. The record closed at the conclusion of the hearing. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s responses in his Answer, his testimony, and the \ndocumentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old. He married in May 2021, shortly before the hearing. He \nand his wife have no children. In May 2019, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, summa cum \nlaude, with a GPA of 3.96 from a prestigious university. He paid for his college expenses \nby working part time in a coffee shop while attending classes on a full-time basis. He also \nhad a $10,000 student loan, which he paid off after his graduation. He received no \nfinancial support from his parents while attending college. After graduating from college, \nhe began working for a DoD contractor in his \u201cdream job\u201d as an engineer and earns about \n$89,000 per year. His wife works as a web and graphic designer, earning about $52,000 \nper year. He and his wife are presently financially stable and are able to pay their current \nbills and save money every month. They have a net monthly remainder of about $1,350. \nAs of year-end 2020, he and his wife had about $7,000 in savings, in addition to about \n$36,000 in retirement accounts. They have increased their savings since then. Applicant\u2019s \ntaxes are current, and he has received tax refunds. He has limited experience dealing \nwith financial matters and in particular with credit and debts. At the time he submitted his \nAnswer, he believed that he was no longer responsible for some old medical debts \nbecause they no longer appeared on his credit report. He has retained the services of a \nfinancial counselor to help him organize his finances by creating a budget and resolve his \noutstanding debts, which are the subject of paragraph 1 of the SOR.

Nevertheless, Applicant now appreciates that he is still responsible for \nresolving these debts. (Tr. at 9-10, 12-14, 29, 31-32, 42; AE A; AE B at 8; AE K at 11.) \nSOR \u00b6 1, Guideline F, Financial Considerations \nApplicant incurred five debts that were delinquent at the time of his Answer to the \nSOR. All of these debts are medical bills for the treatment of a 2013 sports injury Applicant \nexperienced when he had no insurance. The total amount of the medical bills is about \n$75,000. He sought assistance from his local hospital, but he was ineligible because he \nwas over 18 and under 21 at the time he incurred the bills. He has recently applied for a \nfinancial-aid program with the medical center that treated him after his accident to assist \nhim with these bills. It was not until Applicant obtained his current job that he had the \nfinancial resources available to begin paying these medical debts. He has paid one of the \nmedical debts and plans to pay the remainder, either with the help of the financial-aid \nprogram or through payment plans to be developed. He has not yet made any additional \npayments, even on his three smallest debts. (Tr. at 12, 22-26 42-43; AE J.) \nSOR Debts \nIn his Answer, Applicant denied all five debts alleged in the SOR. He wrote that he \nsettled and paid one of the debts and none of the debts appear on his current credit \nreports. The details regarding each of the debts follow: \n1.a Medical account in collection in the amount of $71,801. This bill was incurred after \nhis sports injury. This debt became delinquent in about 2013, and the creditor assigned it \nto a collection agency at that time. Applicant has not been able to pay it. This debt is not \nresolved. (GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2.) \n1.b Medical account in collection in the amount of $2,680. This debt is for anesthesia \nservices that were rendered as part of his treatment for his 2013 injury. Applicant \nnegotiated a settlement of this account for $804. In March 2020, he paid this debt after \nreceiving a settlement offer from the creditor in the mail. He provided a bank statement \nevidencing the payment. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 14-15, 43; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 2; \nAE L-4 at 4.) \n1.c Medical account in collection in the amount of $281. This debt became delinquent \nin about 2013, and the creditor assigned it to a collection agency at that time. Applicant \nhas made no payments on this debt. This debt is not resolved. (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 2.) \n1.d Medical account in collection in the amount of $281. This debt became delinquent \nin about 2013, and the creditor assigned it to a collection agency at that time. Applicant \nhas made no payments on this debt. This debt is not resolved.

(GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 2, Guideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nParagraph 2 of the SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally omitted in his SCA the \nfive debts listed in paragraph 1 of the SOR. In his Answer, Applicant denied that the \nomission was intentional. He wrote that he had no intention to provide a false response \nand was merely mistaken. He noted that he provided significant derogatory information \nin his SCA regarding his past drug use and two arrests in 2012. He also testified that at \nthe time he prepared his SCA, he mistakenly thought he did not owe these medical debts \nbecause they did not appear on his credit report. During his March 2019 background \ninterview, he also explained that at the time he prepared his SCA, he reviewed his credit \nreport and none of the debts listed in the SOR appeared on his report. He testified at the \nhearing that he showed the credit report he used to the investigator. The five SOR debts \nwere initially listed only by Experian, according to GE 3. One year later, they were listed \nin an Equifax credit report in the record, GE 4. Applicant referred to a different credit report \nat the time he prepared his SCA. That credit report used credit information from \nTransUnion and Equifax. He also explained to the investigator that he was unable to pay \nthose medical bills at the time he was hospitalized because he no longer had insurance \nthrough his father\u2019s insurance due to his father\u2019s loss of his job. Applicant was unable to \npay the bills in 2013 because he had minimum wage jobs at the time. (Tr. at 15-16, 25-\n26, 32-33; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2-4; GE 4 at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 3, Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \nApplicant provided information in his February 2019 SCA regarding his past use \nof marijuana. He disclosed that he began using marijuana in 2006 when he was about 14 \nyears old. He wrote that over time, the frequency of his use declined. By the time he was \na high school senior in 2010, he used marijuana infrequently. Most of his use of marijuana \nwas when he was in high school. He used marijuana last in 2018 and then only two times \nthat year. He wrote in his SCA that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. At \nthe hearing, he testified he has not used marijuana since 2018 and will not use it in the \nfuture. He no longer associates with the same persons he did when he used marijuana. \nHe also provided a written statement regarding his intention not to use marijuana in the \nfuture (Tr. at 17-18, 21, 28, 30; GE 1 at 33; AE F.) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant presented five character letters at the hearing. His references describe \nhim as trustworthy, honest, and committed to doing the right thing. He is also described \nas \u201can exemplary, focused and detailed driven engineer.\u201d He works hard, has high moral \nstandards, and is a person of integrity. In the short period of time he has worked at his \nemployer, he has been awarded a formal commendation for his high-quality work and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntireless efforts.

(AE C at 2; AE E at 1-5.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n\n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his testimony and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord establish the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Four of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s medical debts arose in 2013 and were infrequent. They occurred under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. Applicant had a serious accident when he was \nabout 20 years old. He had no medical insurance to pay for his treatment due to his \nfather\u2019s loss of employment. He incurred one large medical bill and four smaller bills that \nhe was not in a position to pay. His parents were unable or unwilling to help him with \nthese bills. They have followed him into adulthood while he was working his way through \ncollege and into his first post-college job in 2019. Now that he has his own medical \ninsurance, it is unlikely that he will experience delinquent medical bills in the future. He \nhas incurred no other delinquent bills. Even though these eight-year-old debts are no \nlonger enforceable and do not appear on his credit reports, Applicant has expressed his \ncommitment to finding a way to pay them, either through a financial assistance plan or \nnegotiated settlements with payment plans. Even though he has the current resources to \npay the three smaller debts, he has not done so. Moreover, his efforts to establish a plan \nto pay his largest debt are very recent and only one payment has been made since he \nlearned about the Government\u2019s concerns with his debts during his background interview. \nUnder the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s debts cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is only partially established. \nThe conditions that gave rise to Applicant\u2019s five SOR debts were circumstances \nbeyond his control. He experienced an accident that caused serious injuries requiring \nmedical care. At age 20, the fact that he had no medical insurance to pay for his treatment \nwas also a condition beyond his control. He has not acted responsibly, however, since \nbeginning his employment with a defense contractor in 2019. He failed to develop a plan \nin a timely manner to pay his old medical debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially established. \nApplicant is receiving financial counseling. He recognizes that he is inexperienced \nin matters involving financial management and the proper handling of indebtedness. His \nadvisor has helped him establish a realistic budget, and he has saved a significant amount \nof cash and retirement assets since his college graduation in 2019. He and his new wife \nearn a significant family income and have a healthy net monthly remainder every month. \nThey are well-positioned to move forward with his counselor\u2019s advice to resolve his \nremaining debts.

He is only now beginning to initiate an \neffort to repay the four remaining debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is only partially established. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe record evidence potentially establishes the following disqualifying condition \nunder AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant failed to list in his 2019 SCA the five medical debts set forth in the SOR. \nThe debts were incurred in 2013, which was within the relevant seven-year time frame of \nthe question in Section 26 regarding debts referred to collection. The Government has \nthe burden, however, to establish that Applicant\u2019s omission of the SOR debts in his SCA \nwas intentional. Without substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s intent to avoid disclosure of \nthe derogatory information about his debts, the above-quoted disqualifying condition is \nnot applicable. To establish its case, the Government relies primarily upon its evidence \nthat Applicant was aware of the medical bills dating back to his 2013 hospitalization and \nhe failed to disclose them in his SCA. \nApplicant denied in his Answer and at the hearing that he intentionally omitted the \ninformation about his delinquent medical debts from his SCA. To support his denial, he \npoints to the discussion in the written summary of his background interview in which he \nadvised the investigator that he had checked his credit report when he prepared his SCA \nand saw that he had no debts reported as in collection. He was unsophisticated in \nfinancial matters and particularly about credit. He did not know that every credit bureau \ndoes not necessarily list all of his debts. He also did not believe that medical bills dating \nback to when he was 20 years old and had been unable to pay while in college in working \nminimum-wage jobs would be considered derogatory. These debts were not delinquent \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndue to overspending or failing to pay his credit cards. Lastly, he points out that he was \nfully transparent in disclosing on his SCA his history of using marijuana. He argued that \nhe would not have voluntarily disclosed that information if he was trying to avoid \ndisclosure of information that might negatively affect his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThe Government presented very limited evidence in support of its allegation of an \nintentional falsification by Applicant. Under the circumstances, the Government\u2019s \nevidence is insufficient to meet its burden of introducing substantial evidence on the issue \nof Applicant\u2019s intent. \nIf the Government\u2019s evidence is deemed sufficient to meet its burden of proof on \nthe issue of Applicant\u2019s intent, the following mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 17(c) \nhas possible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nThe offense of falsifying information on a clearance application is not minor, but it \ndid occur under unique circumstances and is unlikely to recur. Applicant credibly testified \nthat he did not believe he was obligated to disclose debts that were not listed on the credit \nreport he reviewed. He was unaware that information omitted from credit reports would \nbe subject to disclosure under the circumstances of his medical debts. Applicant has \nlearned from the experience of having his application for eligibility for a security clearance \ndenied on a preliminary basis, having to hire an attorney to represent him at a DOHA \nhearing, and having to testify at the hearing. He now appreciates that the Government \ntakes the omission of potentially derogatory information seriously in its clearance \nadjudications. It is unlikely that he would make the same misjudgment, intentional or \notherwise, again. Moreover, the omission does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s overall \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Two of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \nApplicant has fully established both of the above mitigating conditions. His last use \nof marijuana was about three years ago, and at that time, his use was infrequent. His use \nwhile he was in high school was extensive, but as he matured, he reduced that use until \nhe was a year away from graduating from college and preparing to work in a responsible \nposition as an engineer. He has disassociated himself his drug-using friends. He also \nchanged the environment where drugs were used by graduating from college, working in \na professional environment, and marrying. He also provided a signed statement pursuant \nto AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) of his intent to abstain from all drug involvement in the future. It is unlikely \nthat Applicant will use illegal drugs in the future. His past use of marijuana does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, E, and H in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Additional comments \nare warranted. Applicant is an impressive young man who has grown and matured \nthrough his years as a full-time student while also working to pay for his education and \nliving expenses. He now works in the adult world. He made a mistake by not listing his \ndelinquent debts on his SCA, but there is insufficient evidence in the record that he did \nso intentionally to avoid disclosure to the Government. He also established that he has \nno intention of ever using marijuana again. He has not, however, taken sufficient steps at \nthis point in time to demonstrate his willingness to pay his large medical debts, which date \nback to 2013. After weighing the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \ncarried his burden to address the security concerns raised by his personal conduct and \npast illegal drug use, but he has failed to satisfy his burden to present sufficient evidence \nto mitigate concerns raised by financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant denied all of the allegations. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 75-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties of an engineer. He began working at his present job in June 2019. Applicant retired from full-time employment in 2010. He remained retired and not working until about 2017 when he took a part-time job. During his retirement period, he moved to a foreign country to live part time and where he purchased a home (FH). He was solicited by his current employer to work for them, because of his engineering background, which he did, starting in 2019. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1969.

After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 75-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties \nof an engineer. He began working at his present job in June 2019. Applicant retired from \nfull-time employment in 2010. He remained retired and not working until about 2017 when \nhe took a part-time job. During his retirement period, he moved to a foreign country to live \npart time and where he purchased a home (FH). He was solicited by his current employer \nto work for them, because of his engineering background, which he did, starting in 2019. \nHe earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1969. He is twice divorced (2005 and 2008) and was \nmost recently married in 2011. He has three children (one is deceased), the youngest for \nwhich he pays child support. He has previously held a security clearance. (Tr. 6, 30; GE \n1, 5) \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts (seven credit cards and a medical \ndebt) totaling approximately $48,000. The debts are established by credit reports from \nAugust 2019, January 2020, and February 2021. Applicant\u2019s responses in his July 2019 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA); and his personal subject interview (PSI) with a \ndefense investigator in September 2019. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h) (GE 1-5) \nApplicant admitted that he applied for the credit cards and incurred charges using \nthe cards for renovating his FH. He made payments on all the cards for some time, then \nbetween September and November 2018 he stopped making the payments. His reasons \nfor doing so were: 1) he was upset that his credit score went down because he used these \ncards; 2) he believes the credit cards companies do not follow the law that applies to them \nunder the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.\u00a7 1681), specifically he alleges they do not \nkeep appropriate records, they fail to conduct proper investigations, and they fail to \ncommunicate in writing with complainants; 3) he wanted the credit-card companies to \nnegotiate a lower interest rate on the cards. (Tr. 32-35, 37, 40-41, 46; GE 1, 5; AE D, F; \nSOR Answer) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g-$48,079. These seven credit cards have all been charged off for \nnonpayment.

Applicant claimed he disputed this medical debt and it no longer \nappears on his latest credit report. The debt was less than seven years old, so it is unlikely \nthat it was removed from the credit report because it was stale. This debt is resolved. (Tr. \n42-43; GE 4) \nApplicant has more than sufficient financial resources to resolve all these debts. \nHe chooses not to do so based upon principle\u2014he does not believe the credit card \ncompanies follow the law and therefore he will not pay them. His net worth is in excess \nof $1 million. His gross yearly earnings from his job and social security retirement is \napproximately $167,000. After expenses each month, he claims a remainder of \napproximately $7,800. He testified he had the resources to pay these debts, but he would \nhave to withdraw money from his investment accounts and incur tax liability, which he \nwould not do. (Tr.39-40, 48-51, 53, 56; AE A-B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant applied for seven credit cards, used them to purchase goods and \nservices, paid towards the balances on the cards until September through November \n2018, then decided to dispute all the accounts. All seven credit card accounts have been \ncharged off. I find both disqualifying conditions are raised. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing. He failed to produce \nevidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely, since he has a \nphilosophical problem with how credit card companies do business. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable. \nApplicant voluntarily incurred all these debts when he used the proceeds to \nrenovate FH. He did not incur circumstances beyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \napplicable. \nApplicant did not present evidence of financial counseling. Additionally, he failed \nto put forth a good-faith effort to resolve his debts after he decided to stop making \npayments in late 2018. All seven credit cards remain unpaid. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and AG 20(d) \ndo not apply, except to SOR debt \u00b6 1.h. \nApplicant claims he has a reasonable basis to dispute these debts because he \nbelieves the creditors involved have not followed the law. That may be a dispute for \nanother forum, but not this one. Applicant is an experienced, educated engineer and \nvoluntarily chose to apply for these credit cards and accept the benefit of purchasing good \nand services using those cards. He even made payments towards the balances owed on \nthe cards. However, when he became upset with the high interest rates he agreed to pay \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand when the companies chose not to negotiate those rates with him, he stopped his \npayments and disputed all the debts. Under these circumstances, I do not find that \nApplicant\u2019s disputes are reasonable. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s dispute with the seven creditors. However, I also \nconsidered his willingness to use credit cards to finance the work he did at his FH and his \nfinancial resources to be able to pay the debts, but refusing to do so. His judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules (in this case, his initial agreement with the creditors) are called \ninto question by his actions. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix \nC, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He graduated from high school in 1986. He was married twice and divorced twice. He has two adult children. A DOD contractor is currently sponsoring Applicant for a security clearance. He last worked for this contractor in 2019, and he is currently working for a different contractor that acts like a temp agency. He is sent out for temporary employment on ships as a steward or chief cook. His work assignments typically last from four to six months. Once his work assignment is complete, he returns home and finds employment as a cook at a local restaurant until he receives another work assignment. Last year his annual income was approximately $90,000. (Tr. 31-37) Financial Considerations The amended SOR alleges nine delinquent accounts totaling approximately $61,325. Applicant stated that his financial difficulties began in late 2018 after he tried to financially support his second son through college. He also acknowledged that he is a poor manager of money, and he does not always make the best financial decisions.

Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n06/25/2024 \nDecision \nBENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems, and he has taken little action to \nresolve the delinquent debts alleged in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). His credibility \nis questionable following multiple misrepresentations, and although somewhat dated, his \n15 years of being Absent Without Leave (AWOL) from the U.S. military and an Other \nThan Honorable Discharge casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and his ability \nto follow laws, rules, and regulations. The security concerns under Guidelines F, E, and \nJ are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 3, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a SOR to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). Applicant did not respond to the SOR. On March \n6, 2023, the DOD CAF, now named the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS), issued an updated SOR under the \nsame Guideline. The DCSA CAS acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                Amendment to the SOR  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nIn Applicant\u2019s undated SOR response, he admitted all four SOR allegations. He \nlisted that he was using a credit repair company to settle a couple of his delinquent \naccounts, but he did not provide supporting documentation. He requested a hearing \nbefore a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge. \nOn May 31, 2023, Department Counsel notified the DOHA Hearing Office that the \nGovernment was ready to proceed with the hearing. I was assigned this case on February \n23, 2024. On March 13, 2024, a notice of hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for \nApril 17, 2024, using a video-teleconferencing application. The hearing proceeded as \nscheduled. Department Counsel submitted 17 documents, which I admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 17 without objection. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted three documents, which I admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C \nwithout objection. I left the record open until May 1, 2024, to provide either party an \nopportunity to supplement the evidentiary record. Applicant timely provided \ndocumentation, which I admitted as AE D, E, and F without objection. On April 24, 2024, \nI received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.). The record closed on May 2, 2024. \nOn April 11, 2024, Department Counsel made amendments to the March 6, 2023 \nSOR.

He graduated from high school in 1986. He was married \ntwice and divorced twice. He has two adult children. A DOD contractor is currently \nsponsoring Applicant for a security clearance. He last worked for this contractor in 2019, \nand he is currently working for a different contractor that acts like a temp agency. He is \nsent out for temporary employment on ships as a steward or chief cook. His work \nassignments typically last from four to six months. Once his work assignment is complete, \nhe returns home and finds employment as a cook at a local restaurant until he receives \nanother work assignment. Last year his annual income was approximately $90,000. (Tr. \n31-37) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe amended SOR alleges nine delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$61,325. Applicant stated that his financial difficulties began in late 2018 after he tried to \nfinancially support his second son through college. He also acknowledged that he is a \npoor manager of money, and he does not always make the best financial decisions.

He is currently working with this credit repair company. \nHe submitted an exhibit which showed he had settled for less than the full value two \ndelinquent creditors (not alleged in the current SOR) through the credit repair company. \n(Tr. 46-47, 49-50, 71; AE B; GE 4) \nApplicant purchased a 2017 Harley Davidson (HD) motorcycle in December 2016. \nHe put down a $2,000 deposit and financed the remaining $24,000 of the purchase price. \nHe voluntarily returned the motorcycle to the dealership in about 2019 after he could no \nlonger afford the monthly payment. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that he is indebted to HD for an \naccount that has been charged off in the amount of $5,295. As of the date of the hearing, \nhe had not made payments on this account and the debt remained outstanding. At the \ntime he purchased the motorcycle, he stated he also had a vehicle. Applicant admitted \nthat he currently owned a 2022 Mercedes Benz SUV with a remaining loan balance of \napproximately $66,300. (Tr. 37-42, 70) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are two medical debts that were referred for collection in the \ntotal amount of $327. Applicant stated in his SOR response that these medical accounts \nwere settled. During the hearing he stated he would send verification of the settlement \nwhile the record was held open. Supporting documentation was not submitted, and these \naccounts remain outstanding. (Tr. 42-45) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $31,196, \nfor a judgment entered against him in December 2023. Applicant admitted this debt during \nthe hearing. In June 2018 he obtained a loan for $30,000 to pay off several credit cards \nand to consolidate outstanding accounts. In March 2024, he entered into an agreement \nto settle the debt for $27,568. He is required to make 36 payments of $766, with the first \npayment due on March 25, 2024. On April 17, 2024, Applicant made a payment of $1,532. \n(Tr. 8-9, 45- AE A, D) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, are all unsatisfied judgments totaling approximately \n$24,000, and they were denied by Applicant in his SOR response because he was \nunaware that judgments had been entered against him. He clarified that he was not \ndenying that he owed the creditors any money. He has not made any payments on these \njudgments, and the judgments remain unsatisfied. (Tr. 50-53; GE 7, 8, 15) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $568, \nfor a judgment obtained against him in about 2009. Applicant admitted this debt during \nthe hearing, and he admitted he had not made any payments on the judgment. This \njudgment remains unsatisfied. (Tr. 8-9, 50-53; GE 7, 8, 15) \nPersonal Conduct and Criminal Conduct \nApplicant enlisted in the Marine Corps in May 1988. In January 1990, while he was \non active duty in the Marines, he went AWOL and did not return for 15 years. (January \n1990 to January 2005) Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a, and admitted the cross-reference, \nSOR \u00b6 3.a, under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).

In January 2005, he turned himself in to the Marine Corps. He \nwas administratively discharged and given an Other Than Honorable Discharge. (GE 1, \n11, 17; Tr. 53-56) \nOn the August 29, 2018 Declaration for Federal Employment document, Applicant \nlisted that he served on active duty in the Marine Corps from June 15, 1988 to August 20, \n2018, when he received a General discharge. On the November 7, 2019 e-QIP, he listed \nthat he was on active duty in the Marine Corps from May 1988 to August 2005. He did \nnot disclose on either document that he had been AWOL for 15 years or that he had \nreceived an Other Than Honorable Discharge. (GE 1, 3; Tr. 73-76) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c allege that Applicant falsified material facts on an e-QIP \nexecuted by him on or about November 7, 2019, in response to \u201cSection 26, \nDelinquency \nInvolving \nRoutine \nAccounts, \nand \nDelinquency \nInvolving \nEnforcement.\u201d He failed to list two delinquent accounts that were listed on the original \nSeptember 2021 SOR, and he failed to disclose that at the time he filled out the e-QIP, \nhis child support was referred for collections in 2012 and delinquent in the amount of \n$9,544. Applicant denied these allegations. During the hearing he stated the two \ndelinquent accounts had been placed with the credit repair company in approximately \nNovember 2019, which contradicts his earlier testimony that he has been with this \ncompany since about 2021. It is important to note that he also did not list on the same e-\nQIP that he was currently utilizing or seeking assistance from a credit counseling service. \nHe did not disclose he was delinquent on child support because he was unaware that he \nwas delinquent, as he had paid his ex-wife cash for child support at times, which was not \nrecorded. (Tr. 56-67) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on an e-QIP, executed by \nhim on or about November 7, 2019, in response to \u201cSection 28 \u2013 Non-Criminal Court \nActions.\u201d He deliberately failed to list that he had civil cases with outstanding judgments \npending against him, as set forth in subparagraphs 1.e through 1.i, above. Applicant listed \na home address on the e-QIP, and evidence showed that legal documents were sent to \nthis address which served as notice. At the hearing Applicant claimed he never lived at \nthat address, but only had his mail transferred to that address. \nCharacter Evidence \nA Captain, Chief Steward, and a restaurant operator provided letters of \nrecommendation praising Applicant for his outstanding abilities as chef and steward. They \nhave observed him to use skilled and safe practices in a kitchen; he is organized; and he \nhas knowledge as well as the ability to prepare a variety of delicious meals. Applicant \nalso provided photos of prepared meals he has served to others. (AE E, F) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nConditions that may raise financial considerations security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe Government established that Applicant has nine delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $61,325. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent \nto effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient assurances that the nine debts totaling \napproximately $61,325 are being resolved or that his finances are under control. His debts \nare not recent, and some have lingered for more than a decade. It should be noted that \nApplicant called a creditor in late February 2024 and made a settlement offer, almost a \nyear after the SOR was issued and just before his hearing. The creditor accepted the \noffer and to date, there is evidence of one payment in April 2024 on a repayment plan \nthat will take three years to satisfy the debt. Applicant did not establish a history or track \nrecord of consistent payments on this debt, or any debt resolution plan for the remaining \ndebts. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed \non notice that his or her clearance or eligibility for a security clearance is in jeopardy may \nlack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, \n2019). \nApplicant is working with a consumer credit repair company, and he provided \ndocumentation that two debts not alleged in the current SOR were settled for less than \nthe full balance. There is no supporting evidence, however, to show whether his credit \nrepair company is actively working to resolve his outstanding debts and unsatisfied \njudgments. He admitted that he is a poor manager of money, and a recent purchase of a \n2022 luxury model SUV where he currently owes $66,300 on the loan is an example of \nhis inability to make sound financial decisions. I find that Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial \nproblems continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe personal conduct security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(d) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant admitted his 15-year AWOL from the Marine Corps, and he eventually \nreceived an Other Than Honorable Discharge because of this AWOL. The evidence in \nthe record also showed he did not disclose, as required, adverse information on his \nNovember 2019 e-QIP about his delinquent debts and unsatisfied judgments. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \nand 16(d) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  \nApplicant has a long history of failing to pay his creditors, to include unsatisfied \njudgments in the SOR that were filed or entered against him in 2006. He also admitted \nthat he has a history of making reckless financial decisions to his detriment. At the \nhearing, he stated that he did not deny the actual delinquent debts or unsatisfied \njudgments; he denied being aware of them when he filled out the e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s \ndenials of falsification must be evaluated in the context of his other contemporaneous \nconduct that raised credibility concerns. \nApplicant also claimed during the hearing the reason he did not list his delinquent \ncreditors was due to paying those creditors through the consumer credit repair. He did \nnot, however, list on the same e-QIP that he was using the consumer credit service, as \nrequired. He listed an address on the e-QIP, but at the hearing he denied living at that \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naddress. He also did not list accurate information about his actual period of active-duty \nservice with the Marine Corps, or that he was AWOL for 15 years, and that he received \nan Other Than Honorable Discharge in about 2005. Although these last explanations \nwere not alleged in the SOR, in this instance it demonstrates that his overall omissions \nand multiple misrepresentations show that he is not a credible witness. After assessing \nthe evidence and Applicant\u2019s credibility, I find his explanations are not reliable with regard \nto the allegations he denied. He deliberately failed to provide accurate information \nregarding his delinquent debts and the five unsatisfied civil lawsuits on his November \n2019 e-QIP. \nAlthough his AWOL from the Marine Corps and his Other Than Honorable \nDischarge is somewhat dated, the seriousness of the matter remains a security concern. \nApplicant, as an enlisted member of the military, failed to fulfill his work obligations to the \nDepartment of Defense and to his country. What is most concerning in this instance, \nhowever, is that he waited a total of 15 years before turning himself into the proper \nauthorities to take responsibility for his actions. His behavior continues to cast doubt on \nhis reliability and trustworthiness. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 31. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s AWOL and Other than Honorable discharge from the U.S. military \nwere addressed under Guideline E and was then cross-alleged under Guideline J as well. \nNo specific criminal conduct allegations were raised beyond what was raised under the \nappropriate guideline. I have previously addressed the security concerns and to do so \nunder criminal conduct is redundant and unnecessary. His past behavior continues to \ncast doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness. Criminal conduct security concerns are \nnot mitigated. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the adjudicative guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines \nF, E, and J, and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant was praised by a Captain, a Chief Steward, and an operator of a \nrestaurant as being talented, experienced, and he has the knowledge to prepare a variety \nof meals. There is insufficient evidence in the record of a future plan to resolve his \ndelinquent debts and unsatisfied judgments. He was not forthcoming about his adverse \nfinances, and he did not provide accurate information about the true circumstances of his \nU.S. military service on his e-QIP. Overall, the security implications continue to cast doubt \non his reliability and trustworthiness, as well as his ability to follow laws, rules, and \nregulations. Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations, personal conduct, \nand criminal conduct security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a.-2.d.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.

He admitted the delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR; he provided brief explanatory remarks in a one-page \nmemorandum; and he provided one page of supporting documentation. He requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing before an administrative judge. \nOn May 17, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation, some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits herein. The FORM \nwas mailed to Applicant who received it May 25, 2021. He did not reply to the FORM. \nThe case was assigned to me July 28, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 65-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information for a job with a federal contractor. He is married with three adult \nchildren. He and his spouse have lived at the same residence since 1990. His \neducational history includes a diploma from an electronics school awarded in 1986. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes military service (inactive reserve) with \nthe U.S. Air Force during 1973-1974 and 1975-1979.

He ran that business for about six years until he \nclosed the business. He voluntarily dissolved the corporate form of his business in \nDecember 2013. (Attachment 1 to Answer) He had a full-time job as a driver from April \n2014 to March 2015. He had a full-time job as a test technician for several months \nduring 2015. He had a full-time job as test engineer from July 2015 to at least March \n2020. \nThe SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of 13 delinquent \naccounts in amounts ranging from $1,094 to $11,004 for a total of about $66,948. The \ndelinquent accounts consist of two unpaid judgments, seven collection accounts, and \nfour charged-off accounts. He disclosed a single delinquent financial account in his \nsecurity clearance application. (Exhibit 2 at Section 26) \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR, the collection and \ncharged-off accounts are established by a March 25, 2020 credit report. (Exhibit 5) The \ntwo unpaid judgements are established by court records, which show the judgments \nwere taken in 2016 and 2017 against Applicant individually as well as against his \nphotography business in one instance. (Exhibits 3 and 4) A more recent May 8, 2021 \ncredit report shows that the accounts remain delinquent other than a $1,348 medical \ncollection account (SOR \u00b6 1.l), which was paid in May 2021. (Exhibit 6) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems or difficulties to a business failure. \n(Answer; Exhibit 7) He asserted in his answer to the SOR that several of the debts \n2 \n\n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbelong to his photography business, which operated as an S corporation, and therefore \nhe was not personally responsible for the indebtedness. He also claimed that he was \nstill trying to repay the debts although he has limited liability. Other than the document \nshowing dissolution of his photography business in December 2013, he did not present \ndocumentation to show the debts were incurred by his business or that his business \nwas solely liable for the debts. As I read the two credit reports, the collection and \ncharged-off accounts are individual accounts as well as a joint account in one instance. \n(Exhibits 5 and 6) Likewise, he did not present documentation in support of his claim \nthat he has made payments on the debts. Given these circumstances, I find that 12 of \nthe 13 delinquent accounts in the SOR are wholly unresolved. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n3 \n\n                                                          \n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent:  \n \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nSubstantial evidence shows Applicant has more than $65,000 in unpaid judgments, \ncollection accounts, and charged-off accounts, which is not a minor or trivial amount. \nThe disqualifying conditions noted above apply.  \n \n \nAn applicant lives in the real world and can expect real-world problems. The \nsecurity clearance process recognizes that bad things can happen to good people and \nhas a certain tolerance for the possibility of human error and honest mistakes. But an \napplicant is still expected to keep their house in reasonable order. In financial cases, \nkeeping their house in order includes providing a reasonable amount of documentation \nin support of their case in order to show whatever steps and remedial actions they are \ntaking to resolve their financial problems. The security clearance process, like other \nlarge bureaucratic institutions such as banks, hospitals, and insurance companies, does \nnot run on word-of-mouth. It runs on documentation.  \n \n  Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15 \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \nDiscussion \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n6\n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated his history of \nfinancial problems, which are unresolved and ongoing. I have reviewed the mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F and conclude none are fully applicable. In particular, the \nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b), concerning circumstances largely beyond one\u2019s \ncontrol, does not fully apply. Certainly, the business failure in 2013 was a circumstance \nlargely beyond his control. Nevertheless, he has not acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. First, more than five years have passed since the business failure in \n2013. He has had a reasonable amount of time to address his indebtedness in a \ncomprehensive fashion, such as settlement agreements, repayment arrangements, or \nperhaps bankruptcy. Second, although his claims seem plausible, he has not provided \nsupporting documentation to establish his claims of corporate indebtedness or proof of \npayment. Accordingly, he does not receive the benefit of mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) or \nany of the other mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. In doing so, I gave \nweight to his honorable military service for which I have respect and appreciation. I \nconclude that he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 9, 2020, Applicant owed delinquent debts totaling $52,529 on 12 accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l). When he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant stated: For all of the above I admit to being delinquent. A bankruptcy lawyer was hired approx. 1.5 years ago [and] was given a down payment but did no work. I had no means (money) to continue to pursue. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 40-year-old engineering technician.

The SOR \nexplained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn January 5, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and he requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). Referral of the case to the Hearing Office was delayed because of the COVID \npandemic. On February 27, 2021, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was \nready to proceed to a hearing. On April 12, 2021, the case was assigned to me to conduct \na hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of \nthe United States to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On receipt of the \ncase assignment and file on April 20, 2021, I informed Applicant of the possibility of an \nonline video hearing, which he accepted. Following a successful test of the Defense \nCollaboration Services (DCS) system, on May 4, 2021, I issued a notice scheduling \nApplicant\u2019s DCS video teleconference hearing for May 24, 2021. \nThe online hearing was held as scheduled. Four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) \nwere admitted into the record without any objections. Applicant presented no exhibits, but \nhe testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on June 2, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 9, 2020, Applicant owed \ndelinquent debts totaling $52,529 on 12 accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l). When he responded to \nthe SOR allegations, Applicant stated: \nFor all of the above I admit to being delinquent. A bankruptcy lawyer was \nhired approx. 1.5 years ago [and] was given a down payment but did no \nwork.  I had no means (money) to continue to pursue. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is a 40-year-old engineering technician. Married since December 2011, he \nand his spouse have no children. Applicant served honorably on active duty in the U.S. \nmilitary from June 1999 to December 2014. He held a DOD security clearance for the \nduration of his military service, and in August 2008, he was determined eligible for access \nto sensitive compartmented information (SCI). (GE 1.) He was separated from the military \nin December 2014 for failing to maintain physical fitness standards. (GE 4; Tr. 23-24.) He \nhad struggled to meet height and weight standards and \u201cfinally [he] just couldn\u2019t do it \nanymore.\u201d (Tr. 24.) \nAfter his military discharge, Applicant began working as a quality inspector for a \nlocal company almost immediately for some income while seeking better employment. He \nand his spouse began to fall behind in their payments on some debts. (GEs 1, 3.) In April \n2015, Applicant left that job to work for his current employer, a defense contractor. He was \ngranted a DOD secret clearance in February 2016. (GEs 1-2.) He has been assigned to his \ncurrent contract since March 2017. (GE 1.) As a condition of his employer\u2019s contract with \nthe U.S. military, Applicant\u2019s job requires him to hold a security clearance, although he \ndoes not handle classified information with any regularity. He testified that he has not \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn August 2019, the DOD Continuous Evaluation Program (DCEP) developed \nunreported information from checking Applicant\u2019s credit report.

(Tr. 23.) \nOn March 17, 2020, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86). In response to inquiries concerning any delinquency involving routine \naccounts in the last seven years, Applicant reported only one past-due debt, but he also \nexplained that after he separated from the military \u201cunexpectedly,\u201d he and his spouse got \nbehind on their bills. (GE 1.) On his SF 86, Applicant indicated that a bank credit-card \naccount had been charged off for approximately $6,000 in December 2019, and that he \nhas been sued for the debt. He stated that his spouse has been in contact with the creditor \nbank to set up a payment plan. (GE 1.) \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on April 25, 2020, revealed a record of extensive \nreliance on consumer credit over the years.

(GE 3.) \nOn May 19, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that his financial situation began to \ndecline when he was deployed in 2013, and his spouse depleted their savings of about \n$10,000 by purchasing kitchen appliances, a washer and dryer, and an entertainment \ncenter.

His \nspouse was unemployed at the time. His first job after his discharge paid him only $30,000 \nto $35,000 annually, which was a significant loss of income from his annual pay of $80,000 \nin the military. He started with his current employer in April 2015 at $46,000 annually. He \nand his spouse resorted to credit cards to purchase groceries and clothing, and to pay bills. \nBy the time his spouse found a job as an administrative assistant at an annual salary of \napproximately $24,000 in 2016, they were struggling to pay their credit-card balances. (GE \n4.) Applicant did not consider taking over handling his household finances. (Tr. 25.) \nIn 2017, Applicant\u2019s pay increased to $53,000 annually, and with his spouse\u2019s \nincome, it brought their household income to $77,000 annually, but their debt continued to \nmount. Applicant was distracted after the death of his mother in 2017. He told the \ninvestigator that he knew at the time that they had credit-card debt, but he did not realize \nthe severity of their debt. (GE 4.) At his hearing, he admitted that his spouse had shown \nhim notices that they received in the mail; that he was aware what was happening but that \nthere was nothing he could do. (Tr. 26.) \nWhen confronted by the investigator about the various accounts on his credit record, \nApplicant expressed surprise to learn that he owed about $45,000 to $50,000 in collection \ndebts, but he did not dispute the debts after speaking with his spouse, who manages their \njoint finances. He indicated that the credit-card debts were joint accounts. (GE 4.) \nHowever, the credit cards are reported on his credit record as individual accounts. (GE 3.) \nHe explained at his hearing that his spouse used his information and opened the accounts, \nalbeit with his knowledge. (Tr. 35-36.) Applicant told the OPM investigator that he was \nembarrassed about his financial situation, and that he did not pay close attention to his \nhousehold\u2019s finances. However, he also admitted that he knew that there were times in \n2019 when he and his spouse had to wait for a paycheck before they could buy food. \nApplicant stated that he had not received financial counseling but he had contacted an \nattorney about possibly filing for bankruptcy. He had not considered using a financial \nagency to help manage his debts because he believes there is a lot of fraud in that \nindustry. As for his plans going forward, Applicant reportedly stated: \nThe $50,000 plus debt is a lot. I hope the bankruptcy works out. If not I\u2019ll \nhave to reevaluate my situation. A fresh financial start will be good for us. My\nwife got a new job in 10/2019. She now brings home close to the same\namount of money I make. I am certain we make enough money now to pay\nour day to day bills and living expenses. I don\u2019t think we have the finances to\nkeep up with our bills with this sort of debt, but I\u2019m certain we will work it out.\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nApplicant added that he and his spouse were living from paycheck to paycheck, but \nthey have reduced their restaurant dining, and their situation should improve now that his \nspouse was earning about $2,500 a month. He stated, and his April 2020 credit report (GE \n3) shows, that he and his spouse were no longer using credit to pay living expenses.

(Tr. 16-18.) Applicant was unable to provide any specifics \nabout their household finances, including about his spouse\u2019s income. She continues to \nhandle their finances. (Tr. 20.) He clarified at his hearing that he never talked to the \nbankruptcy attorney, although his spouse \u201csaid she did.\u201d (Tr. 20-21.) Applicant has not \ncontacted any of the collection entities holding his debts to determine whether they would \nbe willing to settle for less than full balances. (Tr. 21, 26.) He testified that it did not cross \nhis mind, but also that he did not think that his creditors would work with him. (Tr. 27.) \nApplicant and his spouse moved to their current residence in February 2020. (GE 1.) \nThey pay rent of almost $1,000 per month (Tr. 30-31.) The rent at their previous residence, \nwhere they lived for 14 years, went from $825 to $850 per month. (Tr. 31.) Applicant and \nhis spouse did not have any savings for several years. In the last year, they have managed \nto save approximately $2,000. (Tr. 32.) Applicant earned $22 an hour with his current \nemployer from April 2015 to March 2017.

Applicant\u2019s supervisor told him that their employer has financial management \ninformation available, but Applicant \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything with it.\u201d (Tr. 36.) He cannot pay his \ndebts so he did not think the information would be helpful to him. (Tr. 37.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAs of the November 2020 SOR, Applicant owed almost $50,000 in credit balances \nthat were charged off or in collections. Such substantial delinquency amply establishes \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant has the burden of establishing sufficient mitigation to overcome the \nfinancial concerns raised by his failure to meet his financial obligations according to their \nrepayment terms. One or more of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in \nwhole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply because the delinquencies are ongoing. The \nAppeal Board has repeatedly held that unresolved debts constitute a continuing course of \nconduct. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \nApplicant has a case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). While his December \n2014 military discharge was unwanted, it should not have come as a surprise. He lost his \ncareer for failure to maintain physical standards, an issue that he had struggled with for \nseveral years prior to his discharge. Yet, the significant decrease in income once he \nentered the civilian sector severely compromised his ability to remain current on his \nfinancial obligations, so AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in that regard. However, even if Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside of his \ncontrol, I have to consider whether he has since acted in a reasonable manner to address \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n. 9 (App. Bd. Jan. 23, 2007) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A \ncomponent of sound financial judgment is whether Applicant maintained contact with his \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current or settle his \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s evidence falls considerably short in that regard. He knew as of 2019, if \nnot before then, that he and his spouse were having serious financial difficulties such they \nhad to hold off buying essentials, such as groceries, until they received a paycheck. While \nhe may not have been able to make any payments on credit-card balances, he made no \neffort to educate himself about his debts. During his OPM interview, he was surprised to \ndiscover that he owes almost $50,000 in past-due credit balances. Despite knowing that \nthose outstanding delinquencies are of concern to the DOD and could cost him his \nclearance and possibly his job, he continues to ignore them. Even with respect to an \nintended bankruptcy filing, he has allowed his spouse to deal with the attorney and knew \nlittle about the attorney\u2019s advice. He has not met with the attorney himself. AG \u00b6 20(b) does \nnot fully apply. \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) has been established. Applicant admitted at his \nhearing that he has made no progress toward resolving any of the debts. He has had no \nfinancial counseling, despite learning from his supervisor that their employer offers online \nfinancial education. The Appeal Board has held that an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca plan \nfor debt payment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a \nserious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d See ADP Case No, 17-00263 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, \n2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03889 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, 2018). Applicant\u2019s plan \nto file for bankruptcy is not enough to trigger AG \u00b6 20(d) in mitigation. The Appeal Board \nhas previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts, as follows: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u2018good-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good faith \u2018requires a \nhosing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she related on a legally available option \n(such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d] \nmitigating condition. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nA bankruptcy discharge under Chapter 7 or a track record of timely bankruptcy \npayments under a Chapter 13 plan could trigger AG \u00b6 20(c), in that an applicant would no \nlonger have legal liability for repayment of those debts subject to a Chapter 7 discharge, \nand a track record of Chapter 13 payments could well indicate that the debts are being \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresolved. However, it would be premature to apply AG \u00b6 20(c) without proof of a discharge \nor compliance with a Chapter 13 plan. Applicant has yet to file a bankruptcy petition. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is satisfied only as to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, which account information shows is likely \nthe same debt as the collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j. \nIn Applicant\u2019s favor, he and his spouse no longer rely on credit cards to purchase \nitems. They have reduced their expenses by eliminating much of their restaurant dining. He \nexpects their financial situation to improve with his spouse\u2019s recent promotion. However, \nbased on the record before me, his financial situation presents an unacceptable security \nrisk. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n10 \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding involving an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant is not required to fully satisfy his debts to be \neligible for a security clearance. However, even considering his limited means, he has not \ndone enough to dispel the security concerns that persist because of his serious \ndelinquencies. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait \nuntil an applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or \nrevoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. \n29, 2009) (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled \nthat once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence of record, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for Applicant. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-:1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial hardship brought on by immaturity and \nirresponsibility. His actions or inactions both demonstrated a history of not addressing \nhis debt and an inability to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has recently directed his focus at resolving his delinquent debts. He \nnow realizes the importance of being responsible and trustworthy in every aspect of his \nlife, including his finances. \nHe has just started the process. Applicant\u2019s financial \nirresponsibility and inaction in the past until recently, casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant needs more time to show the \nGovernment that he will continue to properly resolve his financial delinquencies with \nregular systematic payments and consistency. None of the mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been resolved. Overall, Applicant shows little progress towards resolving \nhis debts. He still owes a significant amount of money to his creditors that he obviously \ncannot afford to pay. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the \nApplicant has carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with his commitment to show financial responsibility, \nsometime in the future he can be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect and \naccess classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.c.   \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e., through 1.k \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s credit report shows that \ndelinquencies on the mortgage first occurred in July 2017. There is a paucity of \npersuasive evidence regarding the mortgage, Applicant\u2019s financial history, and his current \nfinancial status. Applicant choose to have a decision issued on the record, but has done \nlittle to provide mitigating information for my consideration. In addition, Applicant has a \nlong employment history that belies his inability or unwillingness to pay his mortgage \nobligation. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record of action taken to resolve the debt. \nAdditionally, there is no evidence of financial counseling or satisfactory evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s current financial status. Applicant\u2019s mortgage delinquencies have been \nlongstanding and remain a current concern. I am not persuaded that Applicant has a \nhandle on this debt, has taken sufficient action to resolve it, or has shown financial \nresponsibility over the years. As a result and without more documentary evidence, I \nremain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nand the whole-person concept.

(Tr. 16-20; AE A) \nIn November 2020, Applicant hired a tax preparation company to prepare and file \nhis outstanding income tax returns and negotiate a payment plan with the IRS. \nAccording to the filed returns, Applicant owes $ 14,830 in federal taxes and $8,537 in \nstate income taxes for the 2015 to 2019 tax years. Under the terms of the installment \nagreement negotiated with the IRS, Applicant will pay $198 each month. In his post-\nhearing submission, Applicant indicated that he would begin making payments soon. At \nthe hearing, Applicant testified that he received a loan from his parents to satisfy his \noutstanding state tax obligation and pay off his outstanding credit card debts. By the \ntime he submitted his post-hearing documentation, he had not received a receipt of \npayment from the state tax authority.  (Tr. 20-23, 25; AE A \u2013G) \nApplicant timely filed his 2020 federal and state income tax returns. He earns \napproximately $65,000 annually, and does not have any other source of income. He has \nnot gambled at the casino since 2019. Applicant plans to redirect the money he spent \neach month on credit card payments toward the repayment of his federal tax debt and \nthe loan from his parents. (Tr. 24, 26; AE A, G) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). Applicant admits that he failed to file federal and \nstate income tax returns and pay his tax liabilities between 2015 and 2019. He owes \n$14,830 in federal taxes and $8,537 in state taxes. The record establishes the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case. The record supports the application of the following \nfinancial considerations disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe record contains some mitigating evidence, warranting partial application of \nthe following mitigating condition: \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nBefore the issuance of the SOR, Applicant obtained professional assistance to \nprepare and file his outstanding federal and state income tax returns, as well as, \nnegotiate an installment agreement with the IRS on his behalf.

As of \nSeptember 2021, he had not started making payments on the IRS installment \nagreement. He failed to provide the evidence necessary to corroborate his statements \nthat he has paid off his state tax liability. An applicant is expected to provide \ndocumentation to support his statements about his financial activities. (See ISCR Case \nNo. 98-0419 (App. Bd. April 30, 1999)). Furthermore, the tax issues are too recent for a \nfinding that Applicant\u2019s tax problems are under control, or that he is unlikely to engage \nin similar behavior in the future. Accordingly, the record contains insufficient information \nto mitigate the financial considerations concern alleged in the SOR. \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has held a security clearance without incident for \nover 20 years. While Applicant has demonstrated his willingness to resolve his \noutstanding federal and state income tax liabilities, the record does not contain a \nsufficient history of tax compliance or repayment to fully mitigate the alleged financial \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

Nagel, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \nJuly 8, 2021 \nDecision \nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \nOn January 13, 2020, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-\nQIP). (Item 2.)  On December 30, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after \nJune 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 24, 2021.  He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 1.)  On \nApril 13, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case.  A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing three exhibits, was \nsent to the Applicant and received on April 22, 2021. The FORM notified Applicant that \nhe had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM.  Applicant failed to respond to the \n\n \n2 \n \nFORM.  DOHA assigned the case to me on June 29, 2021.  Items 1 through 3 are \nadmitted into evidence and hereinafter referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3.     \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 35 years old.  He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree.  He is employed by a \ndefense contractor as a Part-Time, On-Call Employee.  He is seeking to obtain a \nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.  Applicant served in the United \nStates Navy from February 2007 to October 2015, when he was honorably discharged. \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.   \n \n \nApplicant admits two of the three allegations set forth under this guideline.  He \nadmits that he has used Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, also known as marijuana) off and \non from approximately June 2016 to at least May 2020.  He also admitted to purchasing \nTHC during that same period.  He denies using THC while granted access to classified \ninformation and while in the Navy.  Applicant states that the last time he had access to \nclassified information was when he separated from the Navy in October 2015.   \n \n \nApplicant explained that he has used THC to treat his migraine headaches.  He \nhas used it one to three times monthly from June 2016 through at least May 2020.  He \nnormally purchased a quarter of an ounce every six months from a friend to supply his \nuse.  Applicant understands that THC is illegal under Federal law.  He does not have a \nmedical prescription for the use of this illegal drug.  He states that he believes a \nprescription is difficult to acquire, and he does not know if he would qualify for a \nprescription for its medical use.    \n \n \nApplicant began working for his current employer in December 2019.  He has \nnever disclosed his use of THC to his employers.  Applicant states that he is not subject \nto random drug tests or regular drug screening of any sort and so he has never tested \npositive.  He does not use THC while at work, and only uses it at home for his migraine \nheadaches.  If he gets a migraine at work, he leaves work and goes home.  During his \nsecurity clearance background interview with the investigator, Applicant did not want to \nidentify the individual who supplies Applicant\u2019s THC for the protection of his friend.  \n(Government Exhibit 3.)  Applicant states that if his employer wants him to stop using \nTCH he will do so.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns.  None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable.  Applicant has used THC, for a four \nyear period, from 2016 to at least May 2020.  He used it before being hired by a \ndefense contractor, after being hired by a defense contractor, and even after applying \nfor a security clearance, disregarding DoD policy and Federal law.  Applicant should \nknow that the use of THC, also known as marijuana, is against Federal law and \nprohibited by the Defense Department in any form or fashion.  Applicant is a Navy \nveteran, who held a previous security clearance and is expected to show a high level of \nmaturity, trustworthiness and good judgment.  In this case, Applicant has fallen short of \nmeeting these eligibility requirements.  In fact, Applicant does not meet the \nrequirements for eligibility to access classified information.        \n \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations.  To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them.  Applicant has chosen to live his life to his \nconvenience, and has disregarded the law.  Knowing that the use of THC is illegal, \nApplicant has disregarded the law and used it anyway.  Furthermore, if he is using it \nsolely for his migraines, he has made no attempt to obtain a medical prescription.  \nUnder the particular facts of this case, Applicant does not show the requisite character \nor judgment of someone who has the maturity, integrity, good judgment, and reliability \nnecessary to access classified information.  At this time, Applicant does not meet the \nqualifications for access to classified information.     \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis.  An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not demonstrated the level \nof maturity needed for access to classified information.  This is not an individual in \nwhom the Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking.  In this case, Applicant \nis not subject to random drug tests and so no one knows when he has THC in his \nsystem.  This is dangerous and unacceptable.  Applicant is not qualified for access to \nclassified information, and does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nsecurity concerns.    \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.b. \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant denied each of the allegations set \nforth in the SOR under this guideline. Credit reports of the Applicant dated March 2, \n2019; October 5, 2020; and July 20, 2021, confirm that at one time each of the debts \nwere outstanding. (Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6.) Applicant began working for his \ncurrent employer in November 2018. \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves from 2008 to 2011. While in \nthe military he held a security clearance without incident. \nAfter separating from the military, Applicant attended a university from 2011 to \n2015. He took out both Government and private student loans to pay for his education. \nApplicant borrowed approximately $12,000 each year for four years totaling about \n$45,000 in student loans. (Tr. p. 29.) After finishing his bachelor\u2019s degree, Applicant \nintended to pursue a Master\u2019s degree in Mechanical Engineering. At that time, he \nlearned, to his disappointment, that his bachelor\u2019s degree credits would not transfer to \nany other university, as the university he attended was under investigation for \nmisleading and predatory practices. It was about this time that Applicant also learned \nfrom other students that due to this situation he might qualify for complete forgiveness \nof his student loan debt. Applicant did not make any payments toward his student loans \nunder the assumption that the situation would work itself out. In 2019, Applicant thought \nhis student loans had been forgiven as he did not see them showing delinquent on his \ncredit report. At some point he determined that the private loans he had taken out \nshowed a zero balance owing, but the Government loans still showed owing. (Tr. p. \n34.) In 2020, after receiving the SOR, Applicant was advised by the Department of \nEducation that he needed to file a specific application for forgiveness of his student \nloans known as the \u201cBorrowers Defense Repayment Application\u201d because of the \nuniversity\u2019s misleading and predatory practices.

On two separate occasions, \nApplicant brought unauthorized visitors into the workplace knowing it to be against \ncompany and DoD policy.  A report dated August 22, 2019, from a DoD investigator \nconcerning the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s previous employment and \ntermination disclosed that Applicant had a practical joke played on him by a female co-\nworker.  The female co-worker had a t-shirt printed with a photo of the Applicant on the \nfront of it with a derogatory comment, and wore it to work.  In response, outside of work \nhours as a joke, Applicant texted the female words to the effect, \u201cWait until you see \nsome of the seductive photos I took of you in your cubicle and share them\u201d.  Applicant \nreceived an unrecalled negative text from the female employee, and Applicant \nimmediately apologized.  Applicant\u2019s intentions were to joke around and he had no \nintentions of doing harm or offending anyone.  Applicant was terminated for a violation \nof the anti-harassment offensive work behavior policy, as well as violation of physical \nsecurity policy.  He was not recommended for a security clearance or rehire.  Applicant \n1.i  through 1.k. of the SOR were delinquent private student loans that had been \nplaced in collections in the approximate amounts of $3,505; $3,375; and $1,093.  The \nloans have been forgiven due to misleading and predatory practices by the university.  \nApplicant no longer owes the debts.   \nApplicant currently earns approximately $78,000 annually. In 2020, with over \ntime his total gross income was about $130,000. In 2021, he earned about $90,000. In \naddition to his bills, he pays $900 a month in child support. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntestified that he believes he disclosed this information to his current employer, but he is \nnot sure.

(Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit G.)    \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts that he could not pay. \nThe evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each one of them set forth below: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has demonstrated that his financial indebtedness has been resolved \nand is unlikely to recur. Accordingly, this guideline is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the Personal Conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(1) Untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; and \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior. \nApplicant violated security policy and procedure on two separate occasions when \nhe brought unauthorized visitors into the workplace; he engaged in inappropriate \noffensive behavior directed toward a female coworker, resulting in his termination from \nprevious employment; and he failed to self-report to his current employer\u2019s security \noffice that a writ of garnishment was issued against him for delinquent indebtedness. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur; \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nIn June 2018, Applicant was terminated from his previous employment for a \nviolation of the anti-harassment and offensive work behavior policy, and violation of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \nphysician security policy. Since then, Applicant has still shown some disregard for \nsecurity procedures. \nApplicant failed to inform his security office of his writ of \ngarnishment issued against him for delinquent financial indebtedness. \n(See \nGovernment Exhibit 3, incident report dated February 1, 2021.) \nTo be eligible for \naccess to classified information, Applicant\u2019s overall character and conduct must \nconsistently show a pattern of honesty, integrity, good judgment and reliability. To be \nterminated from employment with a defense contractor and not recommended for a \nsecurity clearance is very serious. Applicant needs more time to show that he can use \ngood judgment and be trusted under any circumstances. More work in this area is \nneeded. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Accordingly, this guideline is \nfound against the Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. At this time, Applicant has \nnot demonstrated that he can be trusted with the national secrets. \nThis is not an \nindividual with whom the Government can be confident to know that he will always \nfollow rules and regulations, and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. \nApplicant does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Personal Conduct security concerns. The \nFinancial Considerations guideline is found for the Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.l \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the single allegation that he used marijuana with varying frequency from about August 2004 to November 2019. His admission is incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old composite material worker employed by a defense contractor since November 2018. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant graduated from high school in February 2006. He attended some college courses in 2018 but did not receive a degree. He has never married and has no children. When Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he used marijuana two or three times a week from about August 2004 to November 2019. He stated that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because he had \u201cno desire.\u201d (FORM Item 3 at 32.) When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2020, he told the investigator that he first used marijuana from January to April 2014 but stopped while he was on probation for vandalism from April 2004 to August 2006. He disclosed that he resumed his marijuana use in August 2006, with his use varying from very infrequent with multiple month breaks to two or three times a week. He occasionally purchased marijuana, but he usually obtained it from friends and social acquaintances. (FORM Item 4 at 4.)

Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions \nor updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. Applicant responded to the FORM but did not comment on the accuracy \nor completeness of the PSI summary, nor did he object to it. I conclude that he waived \nany objections to the PSI summary. Although pro se applicants are not expected to act \nlike lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights \nunder the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the single allegation that he used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about August 2004 to November 2019. His \nadmission is incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old composite material worker employed by a defense \ncontractor since November 2018. He has never held a security clearance. \nApplicant graduated from high school in February 2006. He attended some college \ncourses in 2018 but did not receive a degree. He has never married and has no children. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he used marijuana two or \nthree times a week from about August 2004 to November 2019. He stated that he did not \nintend to use marijuana in the future because he had \u201cno desire.\u201d (FORM Item 3 at 32.) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2020, he told \nthe investigator that he first used marijuana from January to April 2014 but stopped while \nhe was on probation for vandalism from April 2004 to August 2006. He disclosed that he \nresumed his marijuana use in August 2006, with his use varying from very infrequent with \nmultiple month breaks to two or three times a week. He occasionally purchased \nmarijuana, but he usually obtained it from friends and social acquaintances. (FORM Item \n4 at 4.)

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his answer to the SOR and the information in the FORM \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions. The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was frequent \nand did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. He acknowledged his \nmarijuana use in his SCA and in his response to the FORM, but he carefully parsed his \nresponse to the FORM, stating only that he has not used marijuana on the contractor\u2019s \nproperty. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (happened so long ago) focuses on whether the drug \ninvolvement was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is \nrecent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the \nevidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any \nevidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period \nof time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nApplicant\u2019s abstinence from marijuana use since November 2019 is a \u201csignificant \nperiod of time,\u201d but the mitigating impact of his abstinence is limited by his admitted use \nof marijuana for 15 years, including one year while he was employed by a defense \ncontractor. His long-term use of marijuana in violation of federal law raises questions \nabout his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. He submitted \nno evidence that he has disassociated from drug-using associates and contacts or that \nhe has changed or avoided the environment where drugs were used. He has not provided \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse \nand acknowledged that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security. Because he requested a determination on the record without a hearing, \nI had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See \nISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Based on the totality of the \nevidence, I am not convinced that he will continue his abstinence from marijuana use \nonce the pressure of qualifying for a security clearance is removed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He has a high school diploma.  Applicant is employed by a defense \ncontractor as an Aircraft Material Applicator.  He is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2008 through 2017. Applicant admits each of the allegations set \nforth in the SOR. This is Applicant\u2019s first time applying for a security clearance. \nIn about 2007, Applicant explained that a friend and her two children lived with \nthe Applicant and he provided financial support to her and her children. Applicant \nclaimed one of her children as his dependent on his income tax returns in 2008. The \nchild\u2019s mother allowed someone else to claim her child as a dependent. \nFor this \nreason, Applicant\u2019s income tax return was kicked back and not accepted. Applicant \nintended on hiring an attorney to fight the matter and never did. As the years passed, \nApplicant felt helpless about his tax situation. He realized that he needed to file his \nincome tax returns, but he did not have the financial resources to pay the taxes, and did \nnot know how to proceed to get his income tax returns filed. Applicant worked in the \nconstruction industry that was very unpredictable. His employment was not stable or \nconsistent. In 2014, Applicant tried to resolve his tax issues but was not successful.  He \nmet a tax preparer who was going to prepare and file Applicant\u2019s income tax returns in \nexchange for Applicant\u2019s painting services. It was during this time that Applicant had a \nlot of turmoil in his life. Applicant\u2019s step-son had mental problems, a drug habit, and \ntried to commit suicide. He was murdered, and Applicant had to go through the murder \ntrial. Applicant was putting her daughter through private school, in exchange for paying \nchild support, which was expensive. Applicant could not find anyone to prepare his \nincome tax returns who would go back so many years. Applicant was under constant \npressure and stress that prevented him from getting his income tax returns filed.

He has no other delinquent debts and lives within \nhis means. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to file his state and Federal income tax returns in a timely basis \nfor tax years 2008 through 2017. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns as required by \nlaw, for at least ten years. Applicant is aware of the legal requirement to file annual \nFederal and state income tax returns and pay Federal and state taxes in a timely \nfashion. For many years, Applicant has had other pressures in life that have taken him \naway from his tax responsibilities. In 2014, he tried to file his income tax returns, but \neven then, he could not get it done because of distractions. He has now filed all of the \nincome tax returns in question. Currently, he is following an installment agreement to \npay the state the back taxes he owes, and he has paid off the taxes he owed to the \nFederal Government. This shows growth and maturity. However, in this instance, \ninaction for so long reflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor \njudgment. Accordingly, Applicant does not meet the requirements to access classified \ninformation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He is working overseas and making a good salary. He \nhas not made any other payments toward his delinquent debts. He stated that he \ncontacted the creditors after his bankruptcy was dismissed.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including bankruptcy cases and \ndelinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s finances were stable before he was laid off in late 2012. He decided \nhis best option was to buy a business. He attributed the failure of the business to the \nactions of the former owner. He used his personal credit to pay the company\u2019s bills. I \nfind that Applicant\u2019s financial problems and delinquent debts resulted from the failure of \nhis business, which was largely beyond his control. \n \n \nThe real question in this case is whether Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. In light of Applicant\u2019s catastrophic business failure, filing bankruptcy \ndoes not constitute irresponsible behavior. Had he been successful in having his debts \ndischarged or if he was currently in the midst of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case where he \nwas paying his debts under the supervision of the bankruptcy court, I would have found \neverything to be mitigated. Under the circumstances, I do not find the two Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy cases, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i, to be disqualifying. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and \n1.i are concluded for Applicant. However, because the cases were dismissed, they also \ndo not provide any significant mitigation. \nThe Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was dismissed in May 2018, more than three \nyears ago. Applicant did nothing to pay his debts until March 2021, after he received the \nSOR. I also considered Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR in which he denied the \nallegations and stated that the debts were made for his company. It does not appear \nthat he had any intention to resolve his debts until he received the SOR. An applicant \nwho begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his \nor her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules \nand regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nCounting the settlement payment for the non-alleged debt, Applicant has paid a \ntotal of $3,781 towards his debts. I do not expect that he could have paid all or even \nmost of his debts, but I believe he could have paid more. He stated that he intends to \npay the creditors who are willing to talk to him one at a time until they are paid. \nHowever, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service, work overseas for defense contractors, and favorable \ncharacter evidence. However, those positive factors are insufficient to overcome \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

He then entered on active duty in the U.S. Air Force and served honorably until he retired in February 2003. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1989, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in February 2004. He has taken a couple of classes toward a master\u2019s degree. (Items 2-3.) Applicant was employed as a business analyst in the commercial sector from June 2008 to June 2009, when he was laid off. From June 2009 to November 2010, he worked as a GS-11 step 3 trainer of a computer-based information system at an Army hospital. He built accounts allowing for the access of government medical records. (Item 2; AE A.) He resigned in November 2010 to work on a contract basis as a clinical application analyst for a medical company. He was guaranteed 40-hour work weeks at $80 per hour plus $100 per diem in travel reimbursements.

On January 4, 2021, the Government submitted a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) consisting of a statement of the Government\u2019s position and six \ndocuments (Items). The SOR and Applicant\u2019s SOR response were included as Item 1. \nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on January 12, 2021, and instructed \nhim that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on \nFebruary 27, 2021. He responded to the FORM on March 3, 2021. On March 30, 2021, the \nGovernment indicated it had no objections to Applicant\u2019s FORM response. \nOn May 17, 2021, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent national security to grant or continue a public trust position for Applicant. I \nreceived the case file on May 24, 2021. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 3 in the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on February 27, 2019, by an \nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The summary \nreport was included in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 \nE3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in evidence \nand considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under \nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following notice regarding Item 3: \nAlso, please note that the attached summary of your Personal Subject \nInterview (PSI) \u2013 labeled as Enclosure 3 \u2013 is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this \ncase.

Pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, but they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.

Aug. 13, 2018) (holding \nthat it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any objection had been \nwaived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right to object). \nApplicant was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \n\u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, \nor mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe interview summary report, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any \ncorrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the report. In his FORM response, \nApplicant objected to any inference that he would not do what is right with regard to \nprotecting national security, and stated, \u201cTo address the Adjudicative Guidelines of judging \na person\u2019s \u2018life history\u2019 based on a financial setback that is getting corrected is a grandiose \nform of misjudgment.\u201d He did not indicate that the PSI summary reflected other than what \nhe had said. To the contrary, he stated that he may not have provided accurate information \nin some aspects. Furthermore, Government officials are entitled to a presumption of \nregularity in the discharge of their official responsibilities. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n07539 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018). \nApplicant can reasonably be held to have read the PSI summary, and there is no \nevidence that he failed to understand his obligation to file any objections to the summary if \nhe did not want the administrative judge to consider it. Accordingly, I find that Applicant \nwaived any objections to the PSI summary. Item 1 is incorporated into the record as the \npleadings. Items 2 through 6, including the PSI summary as Item 3, are accepted as \nevidentiary exhibits subject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire \nrecord. Applicant\u2019s FORM response is accepted into the record as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. \nSummary of SOR Allegations \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the November 20, 2020 SOR, \nApplicant owed charged-off debts of $17,983 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $6,632 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $5,577 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c); $4,956 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $2,844 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $1,993 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and $576 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.g); and a $516 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h).

(Item 1.) \nFindings of Fact \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 1), \nand his FORM response (AE A), I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 60-year-old computer-based training specialist. As of March 2021, he \nwas with a company contracted to provide support regarding a DOD health information \nprogram. (Item 2; AE A.) He and his spouse have been married since October 1982, and \nthey have a 33-year-old son and a 36-year-old daughter. (Item 3.) \nApplicant was a member of the Army National Guard from approximately November \n1979 to May 1983. He then entered on active duty in the U.S. Air Force and served \nhonorably until he retired in February 2003. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1989, and \na bachelor\u2019s degree in February 2004. He has taken a couple of classes toward a master\u2019s \ndegree. (Items 2-3.) \nApplicant was employed as a business analyst in the commercial sector from June \n2008 to June 2009, when he was laid off. From June 2009 to November 2010, he worked \nas a GS-11 step 3 trainer of a computer-based information system at an Army hospital. He \nbuilt accounts allowing for the access of government medical records. (Item 2; AE A.) He \nresigned in November 2010 to work on a contract basis as a clinical application analyst for \na medical company. He was guaranteed 40-hour work weeks at $80 per hour plus $100 \nper diem in travel reimbursements. When the contract ended a year later, he gained full-\ntime employment in November 2011 at an annual salary of $87,000 as a trainer for a \nhealthcare system, which meant a relocation for him and his family. Applicant initially \nrented in his new location. A year later, he and his spouse paid off their old mortgage, \nwhich they had acquired in August 2006 for $130,000. (Item 4.) In November 2013, they \nbought a home. (Item 2; AE A.) Applicant\u2019s November 2018 credit report shows that, in \nNovember 2013, they obtained a joint 30-year conventional mortgage of $356,000, to be \nrepaid at approximately $2,333 a month. They fell behind 30 days on their loan in April \n2016 but were otherwise current in their monthly payments. (Items 4-5.) \nIn November 2016, Applicant lost his job of five years in a layoff. During his \nunemployment from November 2016 to August 2017 (Items 2-3), he received \nunemployment compensation. (Item 3.) He also had his military retirement income. (AE A.) \nHe and his spouse remained current on their mortgage loan. (Item 4.) Applicant indicated \nin response to the FORM that, at the time, he feared that he could no longer afford the \nmonthly payments of \u201caround $730 a month\u201d for a new 2017 model-year truck, so he sold \nthe truck. With the equity from the sale, Applicant purchased a used 2005 model-year truck \nwith much lower payments. (AE A.) Available credit reports (Items 4-6) do not reflect a \nsizeable automobile loan obtained in 2016 or 2017 for a new truck. They show a vehicle \nloan obtained for $12,400 in November 2016, which could be for the 2005 model-year \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntruck. He had just paid off a $35,092 vehicle loan obtained in April 2014 for $35,092, but \nthat could not have been for a 2017 model-year vehicle. (Item 4.) \nIn August 2017, Applicant began working as a trainer for another medical company. \nIn December 2017, Applicant was \u201clet go\u201d when his then employer mistook his application \nfor another position within the company as a resignation. (Item 2.) Applicant was \nunemployed until November 2018, when he began working out of his home as a full-time \ncomputer-based training content developer for a defense contractor. (Item 3.) \nOn November 8, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to inquiries concerning \ndelinquency involving routine accounts in the last seven years, he listed a charged-off debt \nfor $500 with a sporting goods retailer. He disclosed no other past-due debts, but stated \nunder a section for additional comments, \u201cMy credit is not what it ever has been. It is very \nbad because I could not secure a job. I now have a job and the means to rectify all my \nshortcomings with my credit.\u201d (Item 2.) \nAs of November 24, 2018, Applicant\u2019s credit record showed that, between August \n2017 and December 2017, he stopped paying on some credit-card accounts that were \nsubsequently charged off or placed for collection for $17,983 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $6,632 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b); $2,844 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $1,993 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); $1,352 (not alleged); $576 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and \n$516 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). A credit-card account opened in April 2016 had been charged off in \nApril 2018 for $7,880 (not alleged). Applicant was 90 days past due on a credit-card \naccount with a $5,276 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He was 60 days past due on a credit-card \naccount with a $4,436 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The first major delinquency on that account \nwas in March 2019. He was 30 days past due on a credit-card account with a $6,836 \nbalance (not alleged) as of November 2018. He and his spouse were timely in their \nmortgage payments on their loan balance of $319,735. He was also making timely \npayments of $284 per month on the vehicle loan acquired in November 2016. (Item 4.) \nOn February 27, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by the OPM investigator. When \nasked about his finances, Applicant related that he had defaulted on six credit-card debts, \nbut he did not think they had been charged off. When confronted about specific debts, \nApplicant stated that his financial situation had improved and was good. He recognized the \ndebts in the SOR, except for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and expressed a willingness to pay his \ndebts that were delinquent. He cited lack of work from December 2017 to November 2018 \nas the reason for his past-due balances, and added that he had made some progress \ntoward addressing his debts by paying off a $3,500 personal loan. He was given an \nopportunity by the OPM investigator to provide documentation about his delinquencies \nduring and after his PSI. There is no evidence that he submitted any documentation. (Item \n3.) \nAs of May 3, 2019, Applicant had made no progress toward resolving his delinquent \ndebts. To the contrary, the credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which had been 60 days past \ndue only months before, had been charged off for $4,956. His creditors were reporting \ncharged-off balances of $17,983 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $7,880 (not alleged); $6,632 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$5,577 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $2,844 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $1,993 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); $1,352 (not alleged); and \n$576 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). A $516 debt was in collection status (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (Item 5.) In June \n2019, the creditor owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c placed a $5,495 balance for collection. (Item \n6.) \nIn February 2019, Applicant obtained a vehicle loan for $13,025. In July 2019, he \nobtained a $14,386 loan from a motorcycle retailer. In November 2019, he and his spouse \nsold their home and paid off their mortgage loan balance of $310,502. (Item 6.) It is unclear \nhow much they received for their house, but they took the equity and paid off the \nmotorcycle loan in November 2019. Applicant also paid off his two vehicle loans acquired \nin November 2016 and February 2019 with final payments of $5,958 and $12,243 in \nNovember 2019. (Item 6.) \nApplicant was issued an SOR on November 20, 2020. In response, Applicant stated \nthat, in addition to having sold a truck to reduce their debts, they sold their home, which \ngave them the funds to pay off some debts that had not been charged off. Two creditors, \nwho had been owed charged-off balances of $7,880 and $1,352 (not alleged in SOR), \nallowed him to settle those debts. (Items 1, 6.) Applicant explained that he had secured \nnew employment and had relocated for the income to meet his financial obligations and \nsave for the future. He stated that his military retirement income was sufficient to cover the \ncosts for his residence. (Item 1.) He provided no details about his retirement income or any \ndeductions from that income. \nAs of January 4, 2021, Equifax was reporting that Applicant and his spouse had \nobtained a 30-year mortgage loan for $181,041 with a repayment term of $1,354 per \nmonth. They were making those mortgage payments on time. Applicant was also making \ntimely payments on a credit-card account opened in July 2020 with a $1,200 credit limit. \nHowever, he had made no payments toward the delinquencies in the SOR. (Item 6.) \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant stated that his current credit score is 620 or \nbetter and climbing. He asserted that all of his debts have been paid off except for a few \naccounts that he has been advised to keep to sustain a good credit rating. He stated that, \nin 2019, he retained the services of a bankruptcy lawyer to handle his debt repayments for \nhim. However, after a few months of making small payments (amount not disclosed) to the \nlawyer, Applicant elected to handle his debts on his own. He related, without any \ncorroborating documentation, that he contacted those creditors for whom he had \naddresses, sold what he and his spouse had, downsized, and did his best to pay off what \nhe could. He stated that he paid off some \u201cdischarged notes\u201d and was working with a \ncreditor to eliminate another debt. He attributed his financial issues to an \u201cinstance of \nmisfortune,\u201d and maintained that he is correcting his debts over time. (AE A.) \nApplicant provided no evidence of any payments toward the debts in the SOR. All of \nthe SOR debts but the debt in SOR 1.e had outstanding balances on his January 2021 \ncredit report. Those debts totaled $38,151. (Item 6.) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e had been \ndropped from his credit report, but there is no evidence the $2,844 charge-off balance had \nbeen resolved. Applicant provided no information about his present income or any details \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nabout his budget other than that he \u201calways had a budget and stuck with it for the most \npart.\u201d He asserts that he has always lived within his means. He has had some credit \ncounseling \u201cwith Quicken loans referral,\u201d but he did not elaborate in that regard. (AE A.) \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the \nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with national security. The Deputy Under \nSecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November \n14, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by \nthe Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management. Department of \nDefense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the \nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is \u201can examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing of a \nnumber of variables\u201d known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must \nconsider all available reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. \nThe person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. See Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 \n18: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nApplicants for a public trust position are not required to be debt free, but are \nrequired to manage their finances in a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that applicants might knowingly compromise \nsensitive information for the money to satisfy their debts. An applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive information must be \nconsidered. See, e.g., ISCR 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant stopped paying on approximately $40,000 in consumer-credit debts \nbetween August 2017 and August 2018. Most of the debts have been charged off, but two \nare currently in collection status. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and 19(c),\u201d a history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d are established. There is \nalso evidence of conduct that triggers AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \nApplicant stated during his February 2019 PSI that he intended to resolve his debts. At the \ntime, his account with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d was past due but not yet charged off. That \ndebt and the other delinquencies in the SOR went unpaid as he took on new debt, \nincluding a $14,386 loan from a motorcycle retailer in July 2019. His failure to give \nsufficient priority to resolving his past-due debts raises doubts about his claimed \nwillingness to resolve his delinquent debts. \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by the delinquencies.

Application of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers \nconsideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20.

AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. He \nhas not resolved any of the SOR debts. \u201cAn applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a \ncontinuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the \nGuideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began with the unexpected loss of his job in \nNovember 2016 and his unemployment until August 2017. He was not without income in \nthat he collected unemployment compensation and had his military retirement income, but \nhe also had a sizeable mortgage obligation of approximately $2,333 a month, which \nstrained his finances. He had another lengthy unemployment from December 2017 until \nNovember 2018 after an employer mistook his application for another position as a \nresignation. These job losses implicate AG \u00b6 20(b). However, even if Applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside of his control, I \nhave to consider whether he has since acted in a reasonable manner to address his \nfinancial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n. 9 (App. Bd. Jan. 23, 2007) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A \ncomponent of sound financial judgment is whether Applicant maintained contact with his \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current or settle his \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s evidence falls considerably short in that regard.  There is no evidence \nthat he contacted the SOR creditors once he regained employment in November 2018. He \ncertainly knew as of his February 2019 PSI that his outstanding delinquencies were of \ntrustworthiness concern. \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) has been adequately established. Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 2021 credit report (Item 6) shows that he and his spouse paid off a $310,502 \nmortgage balance when they downsized. While this effort to reduce expenses is viewed \nfavorably, Applicant used the equity to pay off his current vehicle loans, including the \nmotorcycle loan, while his old debts in the SOR remain unpaid. Applicant resolved two \ncharged-off balances, of approximately $7,880 and $1,352, not alleged in the SOR. He \nasserts that he also paid off a $3,500 loan. An applicant is not required to establish that he \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). However, the Appeal Board \nrecently reiterated in ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant \nmust demonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that \nis, conduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d In evaluating his financial \nsituation overall, I cannot ignore that Applicant has made no payments on the SOR \ndelinquencies. \nApplicant presented no proof of any attempts to address those debts placed in \ncollection by the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h. Given the passage of time since the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g were charged off, those creditors may have \ndecided not to pursue Applicant for those debts. However, there is no evidence that any of \nthose creditors have cancelled the debts and issued 1099-C forms requiring Applicant to \nreport as income on his tax returns the cancelled debts. Whether or not those debts \ncontinue to be a source of financial pressure or stress for Applicant, his case for mitigation \nis undermined by the lack of evidence of financially responsible attempts to make his \ncreditors whole. \nThe $2,844 charged-off debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) had been removed from his credit record \nby January 2021. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial \nitems from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or if they become \nno longer legally collectible because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. \nSee Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute \nwhen creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid or when the debt has been charged \noff. The mere fact that a debt has been deleted from a credit report does not necessarily \nmean that it was not owed at one time and does not establish as a matter of law that it is \nnot currently owed. Applicant admits that the credit-card debt was incurred by him, and he \npresented no documentation showing the debt had been settled, paid in full, or otherwise \nresolved. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly mortgage obligation is now $1,345 on a loan with a balance of \n$179,193 as of November 2020, which is a significant reduction from his previous \nmortgage incurred in November 2013 for $356,000. The most recent credit report of \nrecord, which is from January 2021, shows that Applicant has significantly reduced his use \nof credit cards. While he has made positive steps toward improving his overall financial \nsituation, there is little information in the record about his current income or expenses. He \nrecently relocated and took a new job. Doubts persist about his financial judgment, \nespecially in light of his ongoing disregard, without reasonable justification, of the \ndelinquencies in the SOR. The financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are not \nadequately mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him to \nprovide sufficient information about his circumstances to show that he can be counted on \nto exercise sound financial judgment going forward and that his financial situation is \nsufficient stable and not likely to present a trustworthiness concern. Not enough is known \nabout Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, including about his income and expenses, for \nme to accurately assess his situation. While his service in the U.S. military weighs in his \nfavor with respect to the whole-person assessment, it does not entitle him to a position of \npublic trust. He failed to show adequate justification for continuing to ignore the debts in the \nSOR. After considering all the facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is not clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Applicant was confronted with the account during his June 2018 personal \nsubject interview (PSI). According to the PSI, the account was in collection as of January \n2017 with a balance of $24,022. Applicant disputed the debt as not being his, asserting \nthat he had no delinquent credit cards and did not have an account with this creditor. He \ndenied any knowledge of the account. (GX 3.) While Applicant admits the SOR allegation \nin his Answer, he states that he believes the account has been resolved because it no \nlonger appears on his credit-monitoring site and the site does not show any collections \naccounts. The debt is reflected on his May 2019 credit bureau report (CBR) but does not \nappear on his December 2020 CBR. (GX 4; GX 5.)  \nIn addition to the $21,322 credit-card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant\u2019s \n2019 CBR listed four open credit-card accounts, all of which were current at the time. The \ncredit cards had credit limits of $4,500, $3,500, $2,400, and $124. The credit limit on the \naccount that Applicant disputes above was $25,950. Applicant\u2019s 2020 CBR shows only \nthe four current credit-card accounts. \nApplicant\u2019s December 2020 CBR shows that he was 30-days past due on his \nmortgage-loan payment and that he has periodically been 30-days past due with his \nmortgage-loan payment dating back to October 2018. However, the CBR also shows that \nApplicant has never been more than 30 days late on any payments. During his PSI, the \ninvestigator confronted Applicant with being 30-days late on his December 2016 \nmortgage-loan payment. Applicant explained that his wife pays the bills through standard \nmail and that the mortgage payment may have been inadvertently late as a result of this \npractice. (GX 5; GX 3.) \nOn his October 2016 e-QIP, Applicant listed that he had a $320 medical bill turned \nover to collection in January 2016.

With the exception of the single SOR debt and the periodic \nlate mortgage-loan payments, Applicant CBRs show no history of financial delinquencies. \nHe lives within his means and is current on all his other open accounts including his \nstudent loans and second mortgage loan. (GX 4; GX 5.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information.

See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nIn his PSI, Applicant disputed any knowledge of the $21,322 credit-card debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, stating that he did not have an account with the creditor and that \nhe was not delinquent on any of his credit-card accounts. At the time, he had four other \ncredit-card accounts that were in a current status. Those credit-card accounts remained \ncurrent through December 2020. He listed a paid collection account on his e-QIP and \nexplained the reason for the delinquency during his PSI. \nWhile Applicant admitted the SOR allegation, he did not state that he was \nresponsible for the debt. He instead stated that he believed the account was resolved \nbecause it no longer appeared on his credit-monitoring site and there were no collection \naccounts listed on the site. \nThere are only two ways for a derogatory account to be removed from a credit \nreport: automatically after seven years from the date of first delinquency or following a \nsuccessful dispute. The account alleged in the SOR does not appear on the December \n2020 CBR so for it to have been automatically removed due to the passage of time, the \naccount would have had to become delinquent no later than December 2013. If the \naccount was actually Applicant\u2019s, then either Applicant was oblivious about a credit-card \naccount with a $25,950 credit limit and a $21,322 delinquent balance or he lied about the \naccount throughout his background investigation. A more plausible and consistent \nexplanation given the entirety of the record is that the account was successfully disputed \nby Applicant or by his wife. \n5 \n \n\u201cA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) While those granted access to classified information are \nheld to a high standard of conduct, they are not held to a standard of perfection. This is \nthe first time Applicant has been through a security clearance application process, which \nnecessarily includes the first time he has responded to an SOR and subsequently \nreceived a FORM. While Applicant did not provide any mitigating documentation to \nsupport his assertion that the SOR debt had been resolved, it is likely he did not think it \nwas necessary to do so. Specifically, the December 2020 CBR (GX 5) included in the \nFORM corroborates Applicant\u2019s assertion that the SOR account has been resolved. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s listing of derogatory financial information on his e-QIP and \nhis forthcoming explanations about his finances during his PSI, including his consistent \ndisputing of any knowledge of the SOR debt, support the conclusion that Applicant is \ncredible. Applicant\u2019s long history of overall financial stability and his current financial \ncircumstances are indicative of a person who exercises good judgment and are sufficient \nto establish a track record of financial responsibility. He has no history of any significant \ndebt other than the account alleged in the SOR. There is nothing in the record that \nsuggests Applicant is financially irresponsible or that he is likely to incur debt due to \nreckless spending. The SOR debt no longer appears on Applicant\u2019s financial records and \nis unlikely to be a source of vulnerability to coercion or exploitation. Applicant\u2019s past \nfinancial issues do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(e) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant\u2019s overall credit history is indicative of a person who takes his financial \nresponsibilities seriously. Security clearance adjudications are not meant to be punitive \nbut rather are to determine an applicant\u2019s current ability to properly handle and protect \nclassified information. Ultimately, the record shows that Applicant has demonstrated the \ngood judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of those granted access to \nclassified information. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his financial issues. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

She is a high school graduate, and attended college between 1993 and 1997, earning her bachelor\u2019s degree. She has been in a civil marriage since January 2009. She has one child, age 10, and two stepchildren, ages 25 and 26. (Item 2) Applicant\u2019s work history indicates she worked for a private company as a software developer between 1998 and 2019.

In June 2020, her state intercepted her state income tax refund for \n$1,618, and applied it to the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The total owed was \nreduced to $958. (See, Applicant\u2019s FORM Response) Concerning the medical debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.d, Applicant stated she accrued the debts as a result of neck \nsurgery around 2018-2019. She promised to aggregate the three debts into a payment \nplan to be paid in 2022. \nApplicant initially claimed she paid the $152 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nLater she indicated she had scheduled payments and promised the debt would be paid \nby March 2021. She presented no documentary evidence to corroborate her claims. \nApplicant claimed that she had scheduled payments for all of the remaining SOR debts, \nand promised to pay them in 2021. She presented no documentary evidence to \ncorroborate her claims. The SOR debs are listed on a January 2020 credit report, a \nSeptember 2020 credit report, or both credit reports. (Items 4, 5) \nThe $18,198 charged-off auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.h) is a joint account. Applicant \nasserted that she cosigned the loan for her husband. Later, he changed jobs with a \nresulting loss of $400 income, and they could not afford to pay the loan. The dealer \nrefused to modify the auto loan and they returned the car to the lender. There is no \nevidence of payments on this account. \nApplicant submitted documentary evidence showing that she established a \npayment agreement and paid a $252 medical debt to a collection agency (SOR \u00b6 1.h). \nShe paid $50 in February 2020, and made three $50 payments and one of $52 in 2021. \nShe presented receipts for three payments of $50 made toward the $498 debt alleged in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. Additionally, she made $50 payments in February and April 2021 towards a \n$1,352 debt that apparently was not alleged in the SOR. \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed the following debts were scheduled \nto be paid in February-March 2021: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.j, and 1.k. She presented no \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate her claims. She noted that the following debts had \nnot been addressed as of her SOR answer: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i. Except as noted \npreviously, there is no evidence of payments toward the remaining SOR debts. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to not making sufficient money to pay \nher living expenses and debts; her husband\u2019s failure to provide her with financial \nassistance; his changing jobs and making less money; and his periods of \nunderemployment and low-paying jobs. The record also shows she apparently provided \nfinancial assistance to her mother, and had medical problems associated with a neck \noperation. \nApplicant did not present evidence of her current financial situation (gross \nmonthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). She did \nnot present evidence to show that she has a working budget. There is no evidence to \nshow she has had recent financial counseling or has a working budget. \nPolicies \nIn issuing the SOR, DOD acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive);1 and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent, effective June 8, 2017. \nThe DOD considers ADP positions to be sensitive positions. For a person to be \neligible for sensitive duties, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness must be \nsuch that assigning the person to a sensitive position is clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States. SEAD 4, E(4); SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6 2.d. \nApplicants for ADP positions are entitled to the procedural protections in the Directive \nbefore any final unfavorable access determination is made.  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \n1 ADP cases are adjudicated under the provisions of the Directive. (Deputy Under Secretary of \nDefense Memorandum for the Director, DOHA, dated November 19, 2004.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA public trust position decision resolves whether it is clearly consistent with the \ninterest of national security to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to sensitive \ninformation. The Government must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. If it does, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. The applicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nor continue his or her access to sensitive information.  \nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national security as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the Government. Access to sensitive information determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials. SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). \nEligibility for a public trust position decisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned. They are merely an indication that the applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the Government has established for issuing access to sensitive \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, established by her admissions and \nrecord evidence, showing eight delinquent medical accounts in collection totaling \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n$5,913; a charged-off loan for $252; a 2012 - 2013 charged-off auto loan for $18,198; \nand a 2015 collection by a communications provider for $174. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to not making sufficient money to pay \nher living expenses and debts; her husband\u2019s failure to provide her with financial \nassistance; and his periods of underemployment and low-paying jobs. Apparently, she \nalso provided financial assistance to her mother, and had medical problems associated \nwith a neck operation. Those events qualify as conditions that were largely beyond her \ncontrol. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, a $958 medical collection is being paid via application of state tax \nrefunds. It is inconclusive whether this was Applicant\u2019s voluntary action or a \ngarnishment by the state. Applicant paid SOR \u00b6 1.g, a $252 medical collection. This \nallegation is mitigated and concluded for Applicant. She also made payment \narrangements and is paying SOR \u00b6 1.h, a $498 medical collection. She reduced the \namount that was past due by $150. That is sufficient effort to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.h.  \nThere is no evidence of payments toward the remaining SOR debts. As a \ncosigner of the $18,198 charged-off auto loan, she is liable for the debt, even if she \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexpected the other cosigner to pay it. She stated her intentions to pay her debts in the \nfuture; however, those intentions are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAlthough Applicant is starting to make progress addressing her delinquent \nobligations, she does not have a sufficient track record to establish confidence that she \nwill pay her debts. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that her financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her \ndebts. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant may reach a point \nwhere her finances are sufficiently improved to warrant a security clearance, but she \nhas not established that she is there at this time. I find that financial considerations \nsecurity concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.f, 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e, 1.h-1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na position of trust.

(TR at page 18 line 22 to page 19 line 16, and 39 lines 5~16.) He then \nimmediately ceased his use of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was more \nthan two years ago.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant smoked and purchased marijuana. He had a security clearance for his \njob during that time. Therefore, concerns under AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana ended more than two years ago. His \nusage was based on a false assumption that if it was legal in his state, he could use it. \nOnce informed of the error of his assumption, he immediately ceased using and \npurchasing marijuana.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004. She married in \n2015 and has a four-year-old child. She held an interim secret security clearance in 2008 \nand was granted a secret security clearance in 2009, which she has held to the present. \nShe has been employed by the same federal contractor since August 2006. (Items 3, 5, \n6) \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 2019 security clearance application (SCA) she disclosed that \nshe used marijuana from January 1999 to March 2019. She stated: \u201cI have used \nmarijuana at concerts or specific events.

Applicant stated she was at a concert and \nmay have passively inhaled marijuana so she listed this as a \u201cuse.\u201d She said she last \nsmoked marijuana in 2016 at a concert. She said it is usually provided by unknown people \nat concerts. She has used marijuana intermittently throughout the years, sometimes going \nmany years without using. She stated she had no further intent to use marijuana in the \nfuture. She explained however that she cannot control others smoking marijuana around \nher when she attends concerts or events and that she could inhale marijuana while there \nand then she could potentially test positive during a drug test. She will try her best to \nremove herself from crowds where marijuana is being used. (GE 4) \nApplicant stated she did not fully understand the consequences of smoking \nmarijuana, but learned it could jeopardize her career and it is not worth using. She claimed \nshe was unaware of any policy by her employer that prohibited marijuana use outside of \nwork. (GE 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM she stated: \u201cDuring my interview, I did not \ndeny what was in my application.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted to illegally using marijuana from 1999 to 2019. She was granted \nan interim secret security clearance in 2008 and a secret clearance in 2009. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last illegal marijuana use was two months before she completed her \nmost recent SCA. Although she said this use was through passive inhalation, I did not \nfind her statement credible. Applicant has used marijuana numerous times while holding \na security clearance. Her explanation that she did not know if her employer had a policy \nagainst using marijuana while not at work, does not relieve her of her duty to abstain while \nentrusted with a security clearance. Applicant had a duty to know the rules when she was \ngranted a security clearance Applicant\u2019s statement that in the future, she may be around \npeople who are smoking marijuana so she may passively inhale it and then test positive \nis somewhat disingenuous as a future defense to testing positive for drugs. Although \nApplicant says she does not intend to use marijuana in the future, I am not convinced that \nfuture use is unlikely to recur. Her past conduct casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nApplicant stated she does not intend to use marijuana in the future, but she has no \ncontrol over those around her at concerts who may be using it. She will try and remove \nherself from crowds that may be using marijuana, but she has no control over passively \ninhaling the drug. This equivocal commitment is insufficient to apply AG \u00b6 26(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 40 years old. She has held a security clearance since 2008 and has \nused marijuana from 1999 to 2019. Applicant has not met her burden of persuasion.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 35 and single. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant worked for a defense contractor from 2009 to September 2013 when he was laid off. He was unemployed until he began working for his current employer in June 2014. Applicant has held a security clearance since 2009, and seeks to retain national security eligibility for access to classified information in connection with his employment.

I\u2019ve realized the importance of my work and the \npeople that it impacts. I make my work a priority in my life as well as my \nhealth and wellbeing. With these factors in mind, I have no desire to \ncontinue use. I believe my honesty and being forthcoming with these \nviolations during my investigation also express how much I value my work, \nmy maturity, and my intentions to discontinue use. \nApplicant\u2019s statements to the OPM investigator were similar to those found in his \nAnswer. It is also noted that Applicant stated in his most recent e-QIP that he had, \u201cNo \ndesire to use [marijuana] in future. Primary focus now is on career and better lifestyle \nchoices. The consequences outweigh any added benefit from use.\u201d (Item 3 at Section \n23, Item 5.) \nApplicant did not submit any evidence concerning the quality of his job \nperformance. He submitted no character references or other evidence tending to \nestablish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his \ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \nwithout a hearing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201cThe \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant has a minor history of using illegal drugs. This occurred between 2007 \nand 2019. Altogether his use was less than 20 times. Applicant held a security \nclearance during part of the time in question. Both of the stated disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant had not used illegal drugs for about two years when the record closed. \nBased on his statements in his e-QIP, to OPM, and in his Answer he understands the \nimportance of his job and remaining drug free. He has stopped socializing with drug \nusers and frequenting places where drugs are used. Both of the mitigating conditions \napply. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility and a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant engaged in minor drug use off \nand on for about 12 years. Sufficient time has passed since his most recent use to \ndemonstrate rehabilitation, he has made substantial lifestyle changes, and there is little \nto no likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence as described above leaves \nme without questions or doubts as to Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did mitigate the security concerns \narising under the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

The case was \nassigned to me on May 27, 2021.  \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information. He is employed as a control center specialist for a security \nmonitoring company doing business in the defense industry. He has had this job since \nNovember 2015. His educational background includes attendance at two community \ncolleges during 2008-2011. He was awarded an associate degree in applied sciences in \nMay 2011. He then attended a state university during 2011-2014. He was awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in science in May 2014. He has never married and has no children. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application for the first time in February \n2017. (Exhibit 3) In doing so, he disclosed a history of illegal drug use consisting of \nusing marijuana. He reported smoking marijuana recreationally approximately 50 to 100 \ntimes while a college student during 2008-2014. He stated that he did not intend to use \nmarijuana or controlled substances in the future. He explained marijuana did little for his \nenthusiasm for work and it limited his career potential. \nAbout four months later in June 2017, Applicant was arrested for a drunk-driving \nincident. (Exhibit 5) He consumed a combination of 8 to 9 beers or mixed drinks at \nhome and at a bar. He left the bar and attempted to drive home, but the police stopped \nhim driving the wrong way on an Interstate highway. He stopped voluntarily, but then \nfled the scene when the police approached his car. The police subsequently forced him \nto stop by disabling his automobile with spike strips. A breathalyzer test administered at \nthe police station resulted in a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of .20%, which is well above \nthe legal limit. The police charged him with multiple offenses, including aggravated \ndriving while intoxicated (DWI) and resisting arrest. He subsequently pleaded guilty to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \nthe lesser included offense of driving while ability impaired and the other charges were \ndismissed. \nIn May 2019, Applicant was granted eligibility for access to classified information, \ncommonly referred to as a security clearance. A few months later in July 2019, \nApplicant was subject to a random drug screen, and he tested positive for the illegal \ndrug known as marijuana. (Exhibit 4) \nApplicant did not provide any explanatory information in his Answer to the SOR, \nand he did not reply to the FORM, but he offered some explanation during his \nNovember 2019 background investigation. (Exhibit 5) He stated that he was traumatized \nin May 2017 when he was confronted outside his workplace by a man with a firearm \nwho threatened to shoot or kill him. The binge-drinking episode and the resulting drunk-\ndriving incident occurred the following month in June 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s trauma included recurrent nightmares. He had not used any \nmarijuana from 2014 to 2017, but resumed using it after the May 2017 confrontation. \n(Exhibit 5 at 4) He used marijuana about five times per month during May-June 2017. \nHe stopped for a time after the June 2017 drunk-driving incident. He then resumed \nusing marijuana as a means to deal with stress after a June 2018 breakup. (Exhibit 5 at \n4) He continued smoking marijuana until about July 2019 when he tested positive during \nthe random drug test at work.   \nApplicant reported receiving counseling for his alcohol use and illegal drug use. \n(Exhibit 5) He successfully completed alcohol counseling during October 2017-February \n2018. He stated that he no longer drives after drinking. He also successfully completed \ndrug counseling during July 2019-October 2019. He has not used any illegal drug other \nthan marijuana. He denies any further illegal drug use after July 2019, when he tested \npositive for marijuana. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.6 An \nApplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.7 In addition, an applicant has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, the concern as \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24 is that: \n[t]he illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescriptions and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are use in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose, can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. . . .  \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance abuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n3  484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n7 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n8 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \n5 \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana. It \nconsisted of his recreational use of marijuana while in college during 2008-2014, which \nwas then followed by periodic marijuana use in 2017, 2018, and 2019. His most recent \nmarijuana use was detected by a random drug test in July 2019. Some of his marijuana \nuse occurred during his employment with a federal contractor and while he held a \nsecurity clearance. Any illegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a \nperson\u2019s security worthiness, but it is particularly egregious if it occurs during the course \nof employment while granted access to classified information.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s case in mitigation is not very strong. The one item that stands out in \nhis favor is the May 2017 incident when he was confronted by a stranger who \nthreatened him with a firearm. Acting out or engaging in self-medicating behavior with \nmarijuana or alcohol or both would not be unusual in such circumstances.  \n \nNonetheless, I am not persuaded that Applicant is an acceptable security risk \nwithin the meaning of \u00b6 2(a) of Appendix A of Enclosure 2 to the Directive. I reached \nthis conclusion for a couple of reasons. First, his most recent July 2019 marijuana use \nwas clearly forbidden conduct that he chose to engage in despite knowing the potential \nnegative consequences. In addition to being a serious lapse in good judgment, his \nmarijuana use demonstrated a willingness to engage in high-risk behavior, which does \nnot make him a good candidate for a security clearance. Second, I doubt Applicant\u2019s \nmost recent marijuana use would have come to light but for the random drug test. \nIndeed, he did not report his marijuana use during 2017-2019 to his employer before the \nrandom drug test. Taken together, the seriousness of his misconduct and his failure to \nvoluntarily self-report his marijuana use undermine his security suitability. Finally, I note \nthat the ultimate outcome here is consistent with similar cases that I have decided \ninvolving illegal drug use while holding a security clearance. E.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n02225 (May, 10, 2019), which was affirmed by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case \nNo. 17-02225 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019).  \n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant9   \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant10  \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility is denied. \nMichael H. Leonard \nAdministrative Judge \n9  The June 2017 drunk-driving incident in SOR \u00b6 2.a is decided for Applicant. His questionable judgment \nin light of the incident is mitigated by the passage of time without recurrence, his participation in an \nalcohol-counseling program, and his modified consumption of alcohol. \n10 The cross-allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b concerns Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment in light of his marijuana \nuse. After considering the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E, the matter \nis decided against Applicant under the rationale discussed above under Guideline H. Further discussion \nunder Guideline E is redundant. \n6 \n",

(Item 3) He seeks a security clearance in conjunction \nwith his current employment. \nApplicant received his high school diploma in May 1992, and was awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in August 1996. Applicant was previously married from December \n2004 to April 2008, and that marriage ended by divorce. He remarried in January 2010. \nApplicant has a six-year-old son, and a five-year-old stepson. (Item 3) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists three allegations: (1) that he failed to file his 2017 federal \nincome tax return; (2) that he failed to file his 2016 federal income tax return until \nNovember 2019; and (3) that he owes the federal Government approximately $13,000 \nfor tax year 2016. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c (Item 1)) \nThese allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s October 24, 2018 SF-86; his \nNovember 26, 2020 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Response to \nInterrogatories, containing his April 9, 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninterview; his March 17, 2021 SOR Answer in which he admitted all three allegations; \nand his April 3, 2021 credit report. (SOR Answer; Items 1 \u2013 5) \nApplicant self-reported that he had not filed or paid his 2016 and 2017 federal \nincome taxes when he completed his October 24, 2018 SF-86. He claimed that he was \nwaiting to receive $57,000 owed to him from a contractor following a home building \ndispute. In total, he estimated that he owed $25,000 in federal income taxes, adding \nthat he paid $1,000 for each year requesting filing extensions. (Item 3) Applicant further \ndisclosed that he was involved in a 2016 child custody modification proceeding, and in \n2017 he was sued for failure to disclose information on a 2013 home sale. (Item 3) \nDuring his April 9, 2019 OPM interview, Applicant related that in April 2016 he \ncontracted with a builder to build a $565,000 house. Per the contract, the house was to \nbe completed by December 2016. He withdrew $57,000 from his 401k as a down \npayment to the contractor to begin construction of his new home. Following delays, \nApplicant hired an attorney in January 2017 to sue the contractor for return of his \ndeposit. The contractor terminated the contract in August 2017.

(Item 4) \nApplicant further explained in his Response to Interrogatories that he had \ncomputer software problems with his 2017 income tax return, but that he would contact \na tax service for assistance. He stated that he still owed the IRS \u201ca call.\u201d (Item 4) \nApplicant\u2019s tax transcripts also reflect that Applicant was assessed penalties for failing \nto file timely his 2018 and 2019 income tax returns and pay the amounts due. (Item 4) \nHe did not provide any additional information explaining the reason for these additional \ndelayed income tax returns. \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant discussed the lawsuits he was involved in and \nstated that he had withdrawn 401k funds to cover his attorney fees. This contradicted \nApplicant\u2019s previous statement to the OPM investigator that he had withdrawn funds to \ninvest in new construction of his home. He further stated that the litigation settled in \n2019 and that he received his money back. He provided no evidence that any of these \nfunds were used to resolve his tax debt. (Item 2) \nApplicant claimed that the IRS had still not processed his 2016 income tax return, \nbut did not detail any action he took to resolve the November 2020 IRS inquiry \nregarding the verification of his identity. Finally, Applicant admitted in his SOR Answer \nthat despite his previous statements that he would take corrective action, he had still not \nfiled his 2017 tax return. (Item 2) According to Applicant\u2019s Personal Financial Statement, \nhe has a net monthly remainder of $2,283. (Item 5) \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM discussed specific shortcomings of Applicant\u2019s \nSOR answer, and emphasized long-standing DOHA case law concerning the necessity \nfor applicants to provide mitigating documentation and the seriousness of fulfilling one\u2019s \nobligations to file timely Federal income returns and pay one\u2019s taxes. Except as \ndiscussed above, Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer and FORM Response contained no \ndocumentation that adequately addressed this requirement. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d Based on the evidence contained in the record, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(f) are \napplicable. Further review is necessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six potentially mitigating conditions under these facts: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe Appeal Board explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility to prove applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. (You already said this above)  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) \nApplicant has not yet fully established any of these conditions. As noted, \nApplicant withdrew funds from his 401k in 2016 to invest in new home construction. \nWith the ongoing litigation regarding that property, and knowing that he faced an \nadditional tax burden because of his 401k withdrawal, Applicant failed to timely file his \n2016 Federal income tax return. He eventually submitted this return in 2020 and \nclaimed that he would pay the IRS whatever he owed once the return was processed. \nOver two years elapsed after he disclosed his tax issues in his SF-86. Applicant \nacknowledged in his Response to Interrogatories that he owed the IRS \u201ca call.\u201d With no \nresponse to the IRS inquiry, it was foreseeable that the return had not been processed \nand payments were not made by the time Applicant submitted his SOR Answer. \nMoreover, because of an apparent and ongoing computer problem, Applicant \nfailed to file his 2017 Federal income tax return. However, he was able to file his 2018 \nand 2019 Federal incomes returns, albeit late with additional taxes and penalties due. \nAlmost four years have elapsed since Applicant initially failed to meet his 2016 tax \nobligations. Yet instead of hiring an accountant or diligently engaging in communication \nwith the IRS over those years, he compounded his ongoing tax problems even more by \nfailing to file timely his Federal tax returns for 2017, 2018, and 2019. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nAlthough Applicant filed his 2016 Federal income tax returns, his failure to file \ntimely his tax returns and resolve delinquent tax debt preclude finding he has the good \njudgment and reliability needed to be cleared for access to classified information. \nApplicant must demonstrate that he has acted reasonably under the circumstances. The \nDirective cites failure to file returns as a disqualifying condition in and of itself, \nirrespective of whether the underlying taxes have actually been paid. (ISCR Case No. \n15-03019 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2017) \nIn addition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate adjudicative \nfactors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the context of the \nwhole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant is presumed to be a mature, \nresponsible citizen. Nonetheless, without sufficient information, including corroborating \ndocumentation, suggesting that his long-standing financial problems are being \naddressed, doubts remain about his suitability for access to classified information. \nProtection of the national interest is the principal focus of this adjudication. Accordingly, \nthose doubts must be resolved against Applicant. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record, but failed to submit sufficient \nevidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding his \ncircumstances, articulate his position, or mitigate the financial security concerns. He \nfailed to offer evidence of corrective action taken or provide documentation regarding \nhis efforts to address his SOR allegations. Absent such information, financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 33-year-old configuration management specialist for a defense contractor, employed since December 2017. Applicant is a high school graduate, and served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2006 until she was honorably discharged in 2010. She has a work history of full employment since her discharge from the Marine Corps. She married in 2009 and separated in 2017. She has one child. Applicant previously had a security clearance while serving in the Marine Corps. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $101,052 in five delinquent debts. Her debts include $49,080 in collection and charged-off accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d), and a $51,972 mortgage deficiency after a foreclosure (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.d, and denied SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant explained in her SCA and Answer to the SOR that the delinquent debts were incurred while she lived in State A with her husband. She stated that she was in an abusive relationship with her husband. His history of mental illness and physical abuse of her and the child resulted in a felony conviction against her husband for assault on their child. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant\u2019s stated that her debts were incurred while living in State A with her husband.

Applicant received the FORM on March \n24, 2021, however she did not submit any additional evidence. The case was assigned \nto me on July 6, 2021. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 33-year-old configuration management specialist for a defense \ncontractor, employed since December 2017. Applicant is a high school graduate, and \nserved in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2006 until she was honorably discharged in 2010. \nShe has a work history of full employment since her discharge from the Marine Corps. \nShe married in 2009 and separated in 2017. She has one child. Applicant previously had \na security clearance while serving in the Marine Corps. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $101,052 \nin five delinquent debts. Her debts include $49,080 in collection and charged-off accounts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d), and a $51,972 mortgage deficiency after a foreclosure (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.d, and denied SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nApplicant explained in her SCA and Answer to the SOR that the delinquent debts \nwere incurred while she lived in State A with her husband. She stated that she was in an \nabusive relationship with her husband. His history of mental illness and physical abuse of \nher and the child resulted in a felony conviction against her husband for assault on their \nchild. \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant\u2019s stated that her debts were incurred while \nliving in State A with her husband. Her husband provided little support to the household, \nand she received a 40% pay cut when her employer changed under a new government \ncontract. She noted that SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d were the subject of collection efforts, \nbut she did not have the funds to resolve them. She noted that she is working with a \ncollection company to try to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and she has hired a debt relief \ncompany to help her settle the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d. \nWhile in State A, she and her husband received a foreclosure notice in June 2017 \non a home they purchased with a VA loan. Applicant separated from her husband, sold \nher personal property, and moved to State B. She claimed that she gave her husband \n$9,000 to bring the mortgage up to date, but he absconded with the money without paying \nthe mortgage. The mortgage was foreclosed in November 2017. Applicant\u2019s most current \ncredit report (2020) shows no deficiency balance owed on the property. \nApplicant did not provide evidence showing her current financial status or \nhousehold budget, the status of her debts, or evidence of efforts by the debt resolution \ncompany to resolve her debts. In addition, I have no information on any efforts to obtain \nfinancial counseling. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record are sufficient \nto establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s history of debt accumulation may have resulted from a period of turmoil \nduring an abusive relationship, but there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that \nthe debts were incurred so long ago, were so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that additional delinquencies are unlikely to recur. There is insufficient \nevidence showing efforts to resolve the debts, or that Applicant acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. There is no information in the record showing any financial counseling \nor a satisfactory financial status since the delinquencies were incurred. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nI am convinced however that the foreclosure deficiency debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e has not \nbeen substantiated as the evidence shows that since 2020, Applicant does not owe a \ndeficiency on the mortgage. \nApplicant has a history of full employment although her salary has fluctuated. I am \nnot convinced she acted responsibly to address her debts after leaving her husband and \nState A. I am not persuaded that her financial condition is under control or that it will not \nrecur. No mitigating condition fully applies to debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment history, military service, past marriage, and financial difficulties. \nHowever, I remain unconvinced of her overall financial responsibility and ability, intent, \nand desire to meet her financial obligations in the future. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \n  Subparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant   \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.c. It is unclear if Applicant admitted or denied the allegation in SOR allegation \u00b6 2.a., which makes reference to and subsumes SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.c. I consider it a denial. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 14 line 23 to page 19 line 9, and GX 1 at page 5.) He has been employed with defense contractors since 2004. He has held a security clearance since March of 2005. (TR at page 14 line 23 to page 19 line 9, and GX 1 at pages 12~17, and 43.) He is married, and has one adopted child, age 13. (GX 1 at pages 23 and 29.)

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on August 11, 2021. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.c. It is unclear if \nApplicant admitted or denied the allegation in SOR allegation \u00b6 2.a., which makes \nreference to and subsumes SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.c. I consider it a denial. \nAfter a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 14 line \n23 to page 19 line 9, and GX 1 at page 5.) He has been employed with defense \ncontractors since 2004. He has held a security clearance since March of 2005. (TR at \npage 14 line 23 to page 19 line 9, and GX 1 at pages 12~17, and 43.) He is married, \nand has one adopted child, age 13. (GX 1 at pages 23 and 29.) \nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information & Guideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n1.c. and 2.a. Applicant admits that in 2008, while working for a different employer \nfrom his current employer, he \u201ccut corners\u201d and sent an email containing classified \ninformation to co-workers on an unclassified network. Applicant received a written \nwarning as a result of this security clearance violation. (TR at page 19 line 10 to page \n22 line 20, and at page 49 lines 13~17.) I find his actions to be deliberate. \n \n1.b. and 2.a. Applicant admits that in 2013, while working for his current \nemployer, he again sent an email containing classified information to co-workers on an \nunclassified network. Applicant sent unclassified information that, when combined with \nother unclassified information he sent, became classified. Applicant received a verbal \nreprimand as a result of this security clearance violation. (TR at page 26 line 23 to page \n35 line 10, and at page 49 line 18 to page 50 line 4, and GX 3.) I find his actions to be \nnegligent. \n1.a. and 2.a. \nApplicant admits that in 2017, while working for his current \nemployer, he sent a third email containing classified information to co-workers on an \nunclassified network. Applicant avers this to be a systemic problem with his employer\u2019s \nsystem for handling classified information. Applicant received a verbal and written \nwarning as a result of this security clearance violation. (TR at page 35 line 11 to page \n44 line 4, and at page 50 line 5 to page 51 line 1, and GX 4.) I find his actions to be \ninadvertent. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information is set \nout in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 34. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of protected information to \nunauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal or business \ncontacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or \nconferences; \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information; and \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \nApplicant, over a period of about ten years, on three separate occasions sent \nemails containing classified information on unclassified networks. This resulted in three \nsecurity clearance violations. \nAG \u00b6 35 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35 including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training \nand now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security \nresponsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no evidence of \ncompromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nNone of these apply. Although Applicant\u2019s most recent security clearance \nviolation may have been inadvertent; there appears to also be a negligent pattern here. \nSuch a pattern cannot be condoned when handling classified information. Handling \nProtected Information is found against Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant\u2019s actions are a clear manifestation of a pattern of rule violations. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nNone of these apply. It cannot be said that a similar security clearance violation \nis unlikely to occur. Personal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant is well respected in the \nworkplace. (AppX B.) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Handling Protected Information, and Personal \nConduct security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant responded \nto the FORM with a one-paragraph statement on September 13, 2021. He submitted no \ndocumentary evidence. The case was assigned to me on October 6, 2021. \nProcedural Issue \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that the FORM included an \nunauthenticated summary of his interview with a government background investigator \non October 30, 2019. (FORM, Item 4) Applicant was informed he could object to the \nsummary of his interview, and it would not be admitted or considered, or that he could \nmake corrections, additions, deletions, and update the document to make it accurate. \nApplicant was informed that his failure to respond to the FORM or to raise any \nobjections could be construed as a waiver and the proposed FORM evidence would be \nconsidered. \nApplicant responded to the FORM and submitted a statement, which I made part \nof the record, but raised no objections to the FORM or to me considering the \nunauthenticated summary of his October 2019 interview.

He \nhas two children, ages 12 and 14, and a step-child age 17. \nIn response to questions in Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2019 SCA, \nApplicant stated that he had failed to file federal and state income tax returns and to pay \ntaxes for TYs 2017 and 2018. For TY 2017, he explained that he was homeless and \nunemployed by April 2018, and had difficulty filing his taxes without a residential \naddress. He stated he is inexperienced on what to do and plans to hire a professional to \nhelp him file his late income tax returns. He stated his intention to file as soon as he \ngets back on his feet, and noted he had just bought the software to file his late income \ntax returns. Regarding TY 2018, he indicated that he only worked four months of the \nyear and he believes he did not earn sufficient income to be required to file income tax \nreturns. He also averred he requested his W2 Form from his then employers, and he \nhad not received it. \nUnder the IRS rules, for TY 2018, a single person under the age of 65 has to file \nincome tax returns if the person had more than $1,050 of unearned income (typically \nfrom investments), or had more than $12,000 of earned income (a job or self-\nemployment activity) during the TY. A married person, filing jointly, would have to file if \nthe couple\u2019s gross income doubled the above earnings, about $24,000. \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence to establish what was his gross \nearned income for 2018. He stated in his 2019 SCA, he was unemployed between July \n2016 and February 2017. He was a part-time drilling-reservist with the National Guard \nbetween April 2015 and April 2018. And, he worked full-time as a security officer for a \nhotel-casino between February 2017 and April 2018.

I note that \nhe married his second wife in February 2017, and they separated in October 2018. He \npresented no evidence as to whether they lived together while married. However, he \nstated in his 2019 SCA that he moved to a different state after his discharge and implied \nhe resided there with her during an unknown period. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged a $9,000 collection for a delinquent car loan. Applicant \nadmitted the allegation and stated that he was paying his child support obligation and \nother debts before his debt for his car loan. He implied that his income was insufficient \nto pay this debt until after other debts were paid. He promised to pay the debt sometime \nin the near future. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged a $1,284 collection for a delinquent credit account. In his SOR \nresponse, Applicant stated that he had been working hard for the past few years to pay \nhis debts and he paid off this debt last year. A July 2021 credit report shows that the \ndebt was paid and the account was closed. (FORM, Item 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged a $12,000 collection by a state for delinquent child support.

(FORM, Item 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged Applicant had a mortgage foreclosed in 2014. He explained \nthat he bought a home between 2010 and 2011. In early-2012, he was deployed \noverseas and let a friend stay in the house. The friend damaged the house and moved \nout without letting him know. By the time he found out about it, he was several months \nbehind on the mortgage payments and could not afford the repairs of the house. He \nbelieved that his only option was to let the home go into foreclosure. The July 2021 \ncredit report indicates the mortgage was foreclosed, the collateral was sold, and \u201cthe \nbalance and past due are 0\u201d. \nIn his September 13, 2021, response to the FORM, Applicant stated he mailed \nhis TY 2017 federal income tax return \u201ca few weeks ago\u201d. He indicated that he only \nmade $865.50 in TY 2018, and believes he does not have to file an income tax return \nbecause his income was below the minimum required to file. He further stated that in \nAugust 2021, he settled the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, a $9,000 collection for a \ndelinquent car loan. He also reiterated that he paid off the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.d last year. \nApplicant submitted no documentary evidence to corroborate the above claims, \nexcept for the payment of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d last year, which is corroborated by the \ncredit reports in evidence. (FORM, Items 5 and 6). He presented no evidence to show \nhe has participated in financial counseling or has a working budget. Applicant did not \npresent evidence of his current financial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, \nmonthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). \nApplicant told the government investigator that his financial situation was getting \nbetter now that he was working. He stated he was able and willing to pay off his \ndelinquent debts and promised to be financially responsible in the future. To ensure his \nfinancial problems do not occur again, he intends to maintain his employment and \nobtain housing. Applicant was honest and upfront during the security clearance process \nand disclosed his tax deficiencies and financial problems in his 2019 SCA and with \ngovernment investigators. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must be \nconsidered. [First time SEAD used] \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. As alleged in the \nSOR, he failed to timely file federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018. \nAdditionally, he had three delinquent accounts in collection (a defaulted car loan, a \ndelinquent credit account, and a delinquent child support obligation), and a mortgage \nforeclosed. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns . . . or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant claimed that the filing of his 2017 income tax return was delayed \nbecause he was jobless and homeless, and could not file the taxes without having a \nresidential address. For TY 2018, he claimed he did not meet the minimum required to \nfile and was not required to do so. \nAccording to his work history, between February 2014 and July 2016, Applicant \nwas employed as an IT technician. He was unemployed between July 2016 and \nFebruary 2017. He was hired as a security guard between February 2017 and April \n2018. He was unemployed between April 2018 and January 2019. He has been \nemployed with his current employer and clearance sponsor, a federal contractor, since \nJanuary 2019. However, I note that Applicant was a drilling reservist, and as such a \npart-time employee of the National Guard between April 2015 and April 2018. It is not \nclear whether he was in fact drilling during weekends and the income he earned, if any. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant divorced his first wife in April 2016, and married his second wife in \nFebruary 2017. He stated in the 2019 SCA that he moved to another state with his new \nwife and resided there between February 2015 and April 2018. Applicant\u2019s scant \ninformation leaves many questions and contradictions unexplained, such as his income \nduring the years in question and whether he was in fact homeless. \nSome of above circumstances could be considered beyond Applicant\u2019s control \nand could have adversely affected his ability to timely file his 2017 income tax returns. \nHowever, these circumstances when considered in light of the insufficient information \nprovided in his answer to the SOR, the FORM, and the lack of evidence of \ncommunications with the IRS before he received the SOR, are insufficient to prove he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. He claimed he filed his TY 2017 income tax \nreturn in 2020; however, he failed to present documentary evidence to corroborate his \nclaim. He also failed to provide corroborating documentation such as his W2 from the \nDefense Finance and Accounting Service for his Army Reserve duties and his W2 from \nworking at the casino. He did not provide the IRS income account statement for TY \n2018. He failed to establish that he did not meet the minimum required to file an income \ntax return for TY 2018. \nIn regard to the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information.

He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in \nSeptember 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \nNotwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed when he filed his tax returns, the \nAppeal Board provided the following principal rationale for reversing the grant of a \nsecurity clearance: \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government \nrules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information . . .. By failing to file his 2011, \n2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, [that \napplicant] did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information. \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). \nApplicant\u2019s scant evidence is insufficient to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.a. However, the \nrecord evidence is sufficient to show that he paid off or brought to current the accounts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d, and I find them mitigated. I also find SOR \u00b6 1.e \nmitigated by the passage of time. \nApplicant failed to establish full mitigation of the financial considerations security \nconcerns. I am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances \nor that he made a good-faith effort to timely file his income tax returns prior to \nDecember 2020, when he received the SOR. His financial issues are recent and \nongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate \ndetermination\u201d of whether to grant a security clearance \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant, 33, receives favorable credit for his honorable service in the U.S. \nmilitary between 2007 and 2018. He held a secret clearance while in the service. He \nhas worked for a federal contractor since January 2019.

As alleged in the SOR, he failed to timely \nfile federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018. \nWhen a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how \nlong an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax \nreturns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete \nmaking payments. The Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax \ncases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) \n(reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve \nhis tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security clearance was \nin jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does \nnot reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-\n05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not \nall tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nThe primary problem here is that Applicant knew that he needed to file his federal \nincome tax returns. Whether he knew he was going to receive refunds or had sufficient \nor insufficient funds to pay any taxes owed, he had a requirement to timely file his tax \nreturns. He did not fully understand or appreciate the importance of timely filing of tax \nreturns in security clearance determinations. His recent actions in 2021 are a good start \nfor Applicant to establish his future financial responsibility, but at this time they are \ninsufficient to fully mitigate the security concerns. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not \nwarranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security \nclearance in the future. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated at \nthis time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated criminal conduct and sexual behavior concerns. Eligibility for access \nto classified information or to hold a sensitive position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 23, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the criminal conduct, sexual behavior, and personal conduct \nguidelines the DoD could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility \nfor granting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge \nto determine whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 11, 2020, and requested a \nhearing. The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2021. A hearing was scheduled for \nAugust 17, 2021, and heard on the scheduled date by video teleconference. At the \nhearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits. (GEs 1-4) Applicant relied on \nten exhibits (A-J) and one witness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on May \n24, 2021. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the opening of the hearing, the Government withdrew the allegations \ncovered by subparagraphs 3.a and 3.b of Guideline E.  Prior to the close of the hearing, \nApplicant requested the record be kept open to permit him to supplement the record \nwith a Presidential policy statement covering the revitalizing America\u2019s foreign and \nNational Security policy institutions. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted two \ndays to supplement the record. (Tr. 33) The Government was afforded two days to \nrespond. Within the time permitted, Applicant provided a Presidential memorandum \ncovering revitalization needs for America\u2019s foreign policy and national security \nworkforce. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission was admitted without objection as AE K. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline J, Applicant allegedly (a) received a court martial in April 2006 \nfor the offense of rape, indecent exposure acts, and failure to obey an order or \nregulation (providing alcohol to minors). Allegedly, he was found guilty of committing \nindecent acts, sentenced to reduction in rank to private (E1), confinement to eight \nmonths, and receipt of a bad conduct discharge. Also alleged under Guideline J was \nApplicant\u2019s arrest and charge in January 2009 for disorderly conduct.  Allegations raised \nunder J, subparagraph 1.a, were incorporated and re-alleged under Guideline D. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) falsified the security clearance \napplication he completed in August 2019 by omitting his 2006 court martial when \nanswering question covered by section 22 of the application and (b) later falsifying facts \nin his answers to questions posed to him by an authorized investigator in an October \n2019 interview by omitting the felony charges stemming from his April 2006 court \nmartial. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with \nexplanations and clarifications. He claimed to have served only five of his eight-month \nsentence and was released early for good behavior. He claimed to have accepted full \nresponsibility for his actions and has since acquired maturity since his 2005 incident. \nAdditionally, Applicant claimed that his 2005 incident was an isolated one that has never \nbeen repeated. \nAddressing his 2019 disorderly conduct arrest and charge in his response, (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b), Applicant claimed this was an unusual situation that arose in a bar with two bar \npatrons under the influence initiating a shoving exchange that resulted in all involved \n(Applicant included) being taken into custody by arresting police.

He claimed he could not recall his answer to the \nquestion posed in his security clearance application and tried to be as honest as \npossible in responding to the questions put to him by the interviewing investigator in his \nOctober 2019 interview.

Applicant denied each of the allegations in the SOR, and findings \nof fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in December 2016 and has two children from this marriage \n(ages two and three) and a stepson (age 10). (GEs 1-2; Tr. 19) His youngest children \nreside with him. Applicant earned a high school diploma in 2002 and completed \nspecialized military training in 2003. (GEs 1-2 and AE H) Since 2008, Applicant has \ntaken radiography courses at a local community college to improve his technical skills. \n(AE B). \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Army Inactive Reserve in January 2003 and served \nfour and one-half years in the Inactive Reserve. He was court-martialed in June 2006 \nand received a bad conduct discharge. (GEs 1-4 and AE E; Tr. 21) \nSince August 2020, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nwarehouse specialist, and has recently been promoted to a position described as a \nmaterial coordinator. (AE B; Tr. 20) Previously, he worked for other non-military \nemployers in various capacities. He believes, but is not fully certain, that he held a \nsecurity clearance during his military enlistment. (GE 2) Currently, he does not hold a \nsecurity clearance.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any.  \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nCriminal Conduct \nThe Concern:  Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 18.   \n   Sexual Behavior \nThe Concern: Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense: reflects a \nlack of judgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue \ninfluence of coercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or \nindividually, may raise questions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission.

AG \u00b6 12. \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Since these convictions, \nApplicant has exhibited remarkable maturity and responsibility in his work and fulfilling \nhis family responsibilities at home. His progress entitles him to the benefits of a number \nof MCs under both cited guidelines. MCs \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), so much time has elapsed since the \ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment,\u201d and 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including, \nbut not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d of Guideline J apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. For those allegations cross-alleged under Guideline D, MCs \u00b6\u00b6 \n14(b), \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment,\u201d and 14(c), the behavior no \nlonger serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d apply. \nTo date, Applicant has provided convincing evidence of major improvements in \nhis exercising his professional responsibilities at work and in his caring for his family at \nhome. With over 15 years of elapsed time without any recurrence of the type of \nmisbehavior covered by his 2006 court martial and 2009 disorderly conduct incident, \nApplicant has made a persuasive showing of his overcoming his mistakes and errors of \nthe past with convincing evidence that he has achieved the level of reliability, trust, and \ngood judgment required for holding a security clearance. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether by his action over the past 15 years he has demonstrated \nsufficient restoration of maturity and responsibility to satisfy the minimum standards for \nholding a security clearance.

Before his military \ndischarge in 2006, he was a noted recipient of many awards recognizing his service \ncontributions. Considered together, Applicant\u2019s judgment and trust gains over the past \n15 years outweigh the aged incidents covered in the SOR. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

He seeks to retain his top secret clearance, which he has held since at least \nMarch 2015. Applicant has not served in the U.S. armed forces. \nApplicant was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in February 2008, and two master\u2019s \ndegrees in May 2010 and May 2011. Applicant married in February 2006, and has two \nminor children. \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s three delinquent SOR debts totaling $320,252 are established by his \nNovember 18, 2019; January 24, 2020; October 5, 2020; and February 2, 2021 credit \nreports as well as by admissions in his Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF-86) and his November 20, 2020 SOR Answer. The three debts consist of a $12,516 \ncharged-off credit-card debt and two collection-account student loans totaling $307,736. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.c; Items 2 -7) \nIn his SF-86, Applicant attributed his financial problems to a \u201c[h]ard year with \nchange of employment, shutdown, medical expenses.\u201d He added that he \u201c[w]ill get back \non schedule and re-establish cycles of payment within 3-6 months.\u201d (Item 3 at 37) In the \nsame SF-86, Applicant stated he would do the following to address his financial issues, \n\u201cIn the mean-time of reorganization, I am still making payments to fit budget in the \nmean-time (sic). I am in the process of removing additional loans with payoff and \nestablish free cash to catch up on payments.

He also submitted a letter stating that his \nprescription for eight months of Otezla cost $3,591, and his prescription for two years of \nCosentyx cost $6,057. It is unclear how much, if any, of these prescriptions are or will \nbe covered by insurance. (Item 8) \nIn his response to FORM, Applicant discussed his fear of COVID-19 stating that \nhe lives \u201cin complete fear that as I go to work every day I could have a reaction to the \ndisease, but my family is a priority.\u201d (Item 8) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Based on the information in the SOR, the record \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists seven potential mitigating conditions: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

In addition to evaluating the \nfacts and applying the appropriate adjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have \nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed for the majority of his adult life, and he is \npresumed to be a mature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other information \nsuggesting his long-standing financial problems are being addressed, doubts remain \nabout his suitability for access to classified information. Protection of the national \ninterest is the principal focus of these adjudications. According, those doubts must be \nresolved against the Applicant. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he failed to \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. He failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide sufficient \ndocumentation regarding his past efforts to address his delinquent debt. By failing to \nprovide such information, and in relying on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to \nfully establish mitigation, financial considerations security concerns remain. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of five exhibits (GEs 1-5). Applicant relied on no exhibits and one witness \n(himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 16, 2021. \n Procedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant asked to leave the record open to \nafford him the opportunity to address the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d with \ndocumentation of disputes and payment plans with the listed creditors. For good cause \nshown, Applicant was granted 30 days to supplement the record. The Government was \nafforded three days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant documented his \npayoffs of SOR creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. and a monthly budget for April 2021. Applicant\u2019s \npost-hearing submissions were admitted without objection as AEs A-D for \nconsideration. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nDecember 2015 and received a discharge in April 2016 and (b) accumulated four \ndelinquent post-bankruptcy debts exceeding $4,500. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s post-\nbankruptcy debts remain unresolved. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with \nexplanations. He claimed he petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy after his divorce due to \nproblems he encountered in trying to pay remaining marital debts assigned to him for \npayment responsibility. He further claimed that he is disputing the SOR 1.b debt and is \nsetting up payment plans to resolve the debts covered by SOR debts 1.c and 1.d. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old data center technician for a defense contractor who \nseeks a security clearance.

(GE 1; Tr. 29-37) \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nFollowing his divorce in October 2015, Applicant encountered difficulties keeping \nup with the debts assigned to him for payment responsibility as a part of his divorce \ndecree, and petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 31-33) He \nattributed his bankruptcy petition to his divorce that left him without enough income and \nassets to meet his financial obligations imposed on him in his final divorce decree. (GE \n2; Tr.  22-23) \nIn his Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, Applicant listed assets of $11,346 and total \nliabilities of $101,304. (GE 3) He scheduled non-priority unsecured debts of $86,075. \n(GE 3) Of the listed non-priority debts, all but $5,808 represented student loan debts. \nHe reported monthly income of $2,320 and monthly expenses of $2,110. (GE 3) He \nreceived his bankruptcy discharge in April 2016. (GE 3) \nBetween 2016 and 2019, Applicant accumulated three additional delinquent \ndebts exceeding $4,500. (GEs 2, 4-5) He has since documented his resolving each of \nthese debts with payoffs and payment plans. (AEs A-D) Specifically, he provided \nprobative documentation of his payment in full of the $1,908 SOR \u00b6 1.b debt in March \n2021. (AE A)  He provided documentary proof as well of his paying off the $526 SOR \u00b6 \n1.c debt and $2,167 SOR \u00b6 1.d debt. (AEs C-D) \nApplicant provided a monthly budget for April 2021. (AE B) In his budget, he \nreported monthly income of $3,357, monthly expenses of $2,949, and a net monthly \nremainder of $131. (AE B; Tr. 58) Applicant characterized his budget as generally \ntypical of his monthly income and expense breakdown. (AE B) He is current with his tax \nfilings and payments (both federal and local), and his accrued student loans are \ncurrently in deferment status.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies and tax return filing lapses. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position.

Also, Applicant discussed in his initial background interview his short trips to \nChina and reported they were with his family for the purpose of visiting his maternal \ngrandmother. He failed to mention in his SCA or his initial background interview that his \ntrip to China in 2017 was for the entire summer when he worked at the Chinese Institute. \n(FORM Item 2; FORM Item 4 at 5, 12-13, 14-15, 16-17.) \nSOR Allegations \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR sets forth five allegations of facts raising concerns \nunder this guideline.

(SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \nLastly, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to disclose his employment with the Chinese \nInstitute in both his SCA (Section 20B) and in his initial background interview on March \n18, 2019. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e.) In SOR \u00b61.e, the Government alleges that it was not until \nApplicant was confronted with the information about his employment with the Chinese \nInstitute, that he disclosed his foreign employment. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross alleges as falsifications the information set forth \nin subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e of the SOR. \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 China \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about China as set forth in \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request and supported by the U.S. Government documents cited \nin and attached to the request. China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese \nCommunist Party (CCP) is the paramount authority. China poses the greatest national \nthreat to the United States. It is the most active strategic competitor of the United States \nresponsible for both general espionage and cyberespionage against the U.S \nGovernment, corporations, and allies. The Chinese National Intelligence Law of 2017 \nrequires all Chinese entities to support, assist, and cooperate with Chinese intelligence \nservices. Chinese intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, \nfrequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can \nuse their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7: \n(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(c): failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 8 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Three of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. The nature of Applicant\u2019s relationships with his \nmaternal grandmother, and the country in which she is located create a possibility that \nApplicant could be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United \nStates. Accordingly, it cannot be concluded that it is unlikely that Applicant could be \nplaced in such a position. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. Applicant has deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties with the United States. His sense of loyalty or obligation to his maternal \ngrandmother, however, is not so minimal as to eliminate the possibility of a conflict of \ninterest that Applicant could be expected to resolve in favor of the U.S. interest. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated failures to disclose voluntarily his paid internship with the Chinese \nInstitute reveals that he is aware of the sensitivity of his foreign connections and the \npossible conflicts of interest they create. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is only partially established. Applicant has had no contact with his birth \nfather since 2000, when Applicant was four years old. He has monthly contact with his \nmaternal grandmother, which is neither infrequent nor casual. As a result, it cannot be \nconcluded that there is little likelihood that his relationship with her could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation. \nOverall, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his relationship \nand contacts with his maternal grandmother, a citizen and resident of China. He has also \nnot mitigated his failures to disclose when required his past employment with the Chinese \nInstitute.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 16 contains seven conditions that are potentially \ndisqualifying under circumstances involving personal misconduct. Two of the conditions \nhas possible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s failures to disclose his employment with the \nChinese Institute in his SCA responses and in his initial background interview on March \n18, 2019, provide substantial evidence that the omissions were intentional. Applicant \nmisrepresented at his initial background information that his trips to China were short and \nfor the purpose of visiting his maternal grandmother. He did not disclose that he spent the \nsummer of 2017 in China for employment purposes. Applicant\u2019s statement in his Answer \nthat he disclosed this foreign employment in the resume he submitted to his current \nemployer evidences that he relied on this foreign work experience when it might be \nviewed as beneficial to his employment prospects and omitted the information when it \nmight be viewed as a negative to his eligibility for a security clearance. Also, Applicant\u2019s \nstatement in his Answer that he had assumed internships were not considered \nemployment and were therefore not reportable evidences establishes that he made a \ndeliberate and knowing choice not to disclose this employment.

Two of these mitigating conditions possibly \napply to the facts of this case: \n(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant failed to disclose to the investigator his \nforeign employment during his initial background interview. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. The falsifications are not minor and they were \nrepeated twice during the application process. Applicant has not established that it is \nunlikely that such behavior will recur. His failure to provide accurate and truthful \ninformation to Government security investigators casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence \nas described above leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant=s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. After weighing the applicable disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, \nI conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his foreign contacts \nand personal conduct. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

Section \n26 of that questionnaire concerned Applicant\u2019s financial record and has several subparts. \nAs stated in the SOR, with regard to this case, Applicant was asked if, in the seven years \nbefore the date he filled out the questionnaire, he had defaulted on any type of loan, he \nhad bills or debts turned over to a collection agency, or had an account charged off for \nfailing to pay as agreed?

The investigator stated in a Report of Investigation: \nSubject [Applicant] provided that he has some credit card debt that he did \nnot list as he was not in debt at the time of filling out the form. Subject got \ninto debt as he was excited about his home purchase and wanted to furnish \nthe home and got in over his head with spending. Subject thought he would \nbe able to make all the payments but his spending quickly added up and \nwas unable to make all his payments. Subject does not recall details of each \ncredit card as there is a lot. Subject advised that he fell behind on all credit \ncards around late 2016 and did not know what to do. (Government Exhibit \n2 at 4; Tr. 31, 40-43.) \nDuring the hearing Applicant was asked why he answered, \u201cNo,\u201d on the \nquestionnaire. He stated, \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t think that I had anything on collections, to \nbe honest. I don\u2019t really check my credit report, and I should have at the time, and that\u2019s \nbasically why I put that.\u201d (Tr. 27, 37, 44-45.) \nMitigation \nApplicant is a successful and respected employee. The facility security officer \nsubmitted a letter on Applicant\u2019s behalf, as did the president of his employer. They state \nApplicant is a trustworthy individual and recommend him for a position of trust. (Applicant \nExhibit K.) \nApplicant has received commendations for his work performance. In addition, his \nevaluations are uniformly positive. (Applicant Exhibits J and L.) \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was alleged to owe approximately $41,000 in past-due and charged-off \ncommercial debts as of the date the SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie \nsupport for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant is an earnest person. He has recently made strides in resolving his past-\ndue indebtedness. Applicant began to resolve the debts in 2021 only after receiving the \nSOR. Therefore, these serious delinquencies were recent, so Mitigating Condition (MC) \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese debts were seriously past due because Applicant overspent money to \nfurnish a new house. There is no evidence that these financial problems were beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. MC \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nMC \u00b6 20(c) has application. Applicant has received credit counseling. In addition, \nthere is evidence that the problem is being resolved and is under control. Two of the major \ndebts alleged in the SOR were resolved by the creditor by cancelling the debt. Several \nsmaller debts have been paid. Almost $20,000 of debt is being resolved by payment \nplans. Applicant has addressed all of his previously delinquent debts through one of these \nmeans. \nMC \u00b6 20(d) has application. Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors. He has already paid out a large amount of money, and fully resolved \neight of the eleven debts listed in the SOS. In addition, the payment plans he has \nestablished for the remaining debts are reasonable and are to be paid by automatic \nwithdrawals. As the DOHA Appeal Board has stated, \u201cAn applicant is not required to show \nthat she has completely paid off her indebtedness, only that she has established a \nreasonable plan to resolve her debts and has taken significant actions to implement that \nplan.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. \n04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006)).) \nConsidering all the facts in this case, and after applying both the Disqualifying and \nMitigating Conditions, I find that Applicant has sufficiently mitigated his financial issues. I \nhave considered the fact that Applicant was dilatory in paying these debts. Under the \nparticular facts of this case, his current record of payments has mitigated that fact. \nParagraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe following disqualifying condition is applicable under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP contained arguably incorrect information concerning his \nfinances. The record shows that Applicant knew that he had stopped paying his debts in \nmid-2016. He was asked about whether these debts were in collection, charged off, or in \ndefault status in January 2017 and made a conscious decision that his debts did not meet \nthe criteria. The stated disqualifying condition applies to the facts of this case because of \nthat omission. \nThe following conditions are potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAs stated, Applicant knew in January 2017 that he had stopped paying his debts \nin mid-2016. His argument is that he did not know that his delinquent debts were in \ncollection, charged off, or in default, which were the particular questions he was asked. It \nis noted that the SOR does not allege that Applicant was 120 days delinquent on any \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndebts as of the date he filled out the e-QIP. An analysis of the information from the \navailable credit reports as shown above is very unclear as to when in 2016 Applicant \nstopped paying his debts and when in 2016 or 2017 they went to collections. Whether a \ndebt is charged off, in default, or in collections is a term of art for the credit industry. \nApplicant is not in the credit industry. \nThe question becomes whether Applicant was reasonable in his conclusion that \nhis debts, while delinquent, were not in collection, or charged off, or in default. I find that \nhe was. It is particularly important to note that several collection agencies did not open \ntheir own trade line on the credit reports until after January 2017, when Applicant filled \nout the questionnaire. Further, he freely disclosed his delinquent indebtedness during his \nDecember 2018 security interview without having to be confronted about it. I find that \nApplicant did not have the requisite intent to deceive the Government as to his debt \nsituation. Guideline E is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has successfully \nmitigated the concerns regarding his financial situation and his personal conduct. He has \ndemonstrated rehabilitation and the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress has been \nmitigated.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 30 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He has \ncohabitated with his fianc\u00e9e since January 2020. He and his fianc\u00e9e have a two-year-old \nchild. Applicant has been employed by a federal contractor since November 2019. (Tr. \n16-20; GE 1) \nBefore starting his current job, Applicant had periods of unemployment. He was \nunemployed from August 2017 to April 2018; from January 2019 to May 2019; and from \nAugust 2019 to November 2019. (GE 1) \nApplicant lived with different family members after graduating college. He testified \nthat he contributed to the household expenses. He said at times there were six adult \nfamily members in his parents\u2019 household, and he was the only one working. His parents \nasked him to leave their house in February 2019. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was pregnant with \ntheir child at the time. They moved in with her family and later moved back in with his \nparents. His mother told him to leave the house in February 2021, and he and his family \nwere homeless. He and his fianc\u00e9e now are renting an apartment. (GE 1; Tr. 21-29) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has delinquent student loans that total approximately \n$39,072. Applicant testified that his mother paid his student loans for a period of time and \nthen stopped. Applicant did not know what period of time she made payments or the \namount of any payments. Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in \nDecember 2019 and disclosed he had $44,396 in delinquent student loans. He disclosed \nthat he did not have a stable place to live and had difficulty paying his bills. He said he \nwould start making payments of $100 each month for the next couple of years to satisfy \nhis student loans. (Tr. 30-39; GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in February 2020. He \nacknowledged his student loans and other delinquent accounts. He disclosed the student \nloans became delinquent in 2018 when his mother stopped making payments due to a \ndisagreement with Applicant. He told the investigator he would contact the creditor in \nFebruary 2020 and arrange a payment plan of $100 a month.

Applicant has \nmade monthly payments of $50, and the program will be completed in December 2021, \nupon receipt of his final rehabilitation payment. Post-hearing, Applicant provided proof \nthat he has made consistent payments of $50 a month from April through November 2021. \n(The month of June\u2019s payment receipt was missing from Applicant\u2019s documents, but \nbecause the payments are being automatically deducted, I believe this was an oversight.) \n(Tr. 31-33; GE 5; AE F, G, H) \nApplicant believes that at some point his student loans will be forgiven, and he \nreferred to the program he is participating in as a loan forgiveness program. Once he \ncompletes the rehabilitation program, he does not know what his new monthly payments \nwill be or what period of time he will be required to make payments. He stated that he \nwas advised that upon completion of the rehabilitation program, at some point, his loans \nwill be transferred to a new department and a payment schedule will be made. Applicant\u2019s \nloan rehabilitation application reflects a monthly income of $2,672 and his monthly \nexpense are $3,175. (Tr. 31-39; AE A, B, C) \nThe SOR also alleges a debt for a car repossession from 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.c\u00ad\n$12,569), two medical debts from 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$1,700 and SOR \u00b6 1.b-$499) and a \ndebt for dental services (SOR \u00b6 1.k-$710), all in collection. Applicant acknowledged these \ndebts to the investigator and admitted them in his SOR answer. He told the investigator \nthat he intended to file bankruptcy in March 2020 to resolve his debts and get a fresh \nstart. At his hearing, he confirmed that his intention was to save money ($1,500) so he \ncould file bankruptcy to resolve his delinquent debts. He has $300 in his bank account. \n(Tr. 69; GE 5) \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided a payment receipt of $25 dated November 1, \n2021, for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He stated that he intended to make future monthly \npayments of $25. He provided a payment receipt of $50 dated November 1, 2021, for the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.c and intends to make future monthly payments of $25. In Applicant\u2019s \npost-hearing email, he stated he contacted the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but was \nadvised that no payments would be accepted because Applicant disputed the account on \nhis credit report. That matter must be resolved before acceptance of payments. Applicant \nsaid he asked the creditor that the dispute be terminated so he can start making \npayments. (AE F, I, J) \nApplicant testified that in February 2021, he hired a person to dispute all of the \ndebts on his credit report. He pays him $200 a month. Applicant provided documents to \nshow that every debt on credit reports from the three credit bureaus were disputed, even \ndebts he knows he legitimately owes. He said he was going to pay the debts he knows \nhe owes. (Tr. 61-62; AE D, E) \nApplicant testified that the week before his hearing, he contacted the creditor for \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k and will make payments toward the debt.

(GE 1, \n2, 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant testified that he is reducing his expenses and has cut back on eating out. \nHe is hoping and planning to have a house in the next five years. He testified that this \npast year has made him a man, and he is getting his life together. His fianc\u00e9e testified on \nhis behalf and reiterated that they had unstable housing for a period. She is unemployed, \nbut is looking for a job, and hopes to go back to school to earn her bachelor\u2019s degree. \nShe intends to work while pursuing her education. She stated that Applicant has been the \nsole provider for the past two years. (Tr. 60-61, 76-83) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had delinquent student loans and delinquent debts beginning in about \n2018 that he has not been able to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to unemployment, underemployment, \nand unstable living arrangements. He lived with relatives until 2019 and paid some \nhousehold expenses. Applicant\u2019s mother paid his student loans for a period. After his \nmother stopped paying them, Applicant was unable to pay them himself. Although he \nindicated to the government investigator that he was going to begin paying them in 2020, \nhe did not. In 2021, he entered a student loan rehabilitation program, and has made \nconsistent monthly payments of $50. If he makes the remaining payment, his loans will \nbe out of default and a new payment program will be implemented. Applicant did not \nunderstand the specifics of what the new program would require. At this point, his loans \nremain in a default status, but are likely to be removed from that status. The financial \nstatement on his student loan rehabilitation application reflects he has a deficit of \napproximately $500 each month. \n6 \n \nDespite acknowledging debts that he legitimately incurred, Applicant is disputing \nall of his debts on his credit reports. Applicant\u2019s financial strategy is to file bankruptcy to \nresolve his delinquent debts after he has saved money for the retainer fee. I cannot find \nthat future financial issues are unlikely to recur. Post-hearing, he made minimal payments \non his other delinquent debts and said that he intends to make regular monthly payments \non these debts.

See ISCR Case No. 11-\n14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(e) do not apply.  \nApplicant did not make any payments on his delinquent debts, except through his \nstudent loan rehabilitation program, until after his hearing concluded. The timing of \nresolution of financial problems is an important factor in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case \nfor mitigation because an applicant who takes action to resolve financial problems only \nafter being placed on notice his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment, \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. \n7, 2019). \nApplicant is supporting his fianc\u00e9e and their child and does not have the means at \nthis time to pay his delinquent debts. I am not confident that he has a realistic \nunderstanding of how his student loan rehabilitation program works, nor has he planned \nfor the likely increase in monthly payments once the loans are no longer in a default \nstatus. Although the issues that caused his financial problems may have been beyond his \ncontrol, Applicant did not begin to address his defaulted student loans until a year after \nhe completed his SCA and was interviewed by a government investigator. He did not \nmake payments on the other legitimate delinquent debts until after his hearing. He has \nnot acted responsibly regarding his finances. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nApplicant hired someone to dispute all of his debts. This does not constitute \nfinancial counseling. There are not clear indications that his financial issues are under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. I have considered his participation in a student loan \nrehabilitation program, but he has not yet completed it. At this juncture, Applicant\u2019s recent \npost-hearing payments towards his delinquent debts do not constitute adhering to a good-\nfaith effort to repay his overdue creditors. He has only made an initial payment to each \ncreditor. It is unclear with Applicant\u2019s monthly financial deficient whether he can maintain \nmonthly payments. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 30 years old. Despite participating in a student loan rehabilitation \nprogram, at this juncture, he has an unreliable financial track record. He has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Approximately 20 years ago, they began the process by hiring an \nimmigration attorney to bring them into compliance with existing immigration laws. Post-\nhearing, Applicant submitted a May 21, 2021 letter from his parents\u2019 immigration \nattorney.

(AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D; Tr. \n22-25, 32-34) \nApplicant stated that his parents have lived in the United States their entire adult \nworking lives. Their three children were born in the United States, all of their real and \npersonal property are in the United States, and they earn their livelihood in the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s parents have owned their own home since about 2014. Applicant\u2019s \nparents pay their state and federal taxes every year, and their first loyalty is to the \nUnited States. As a business owner, Applicant\u2019s father provides employment to local \nresidents. Applicant stated that his parents\u2019 intent is to pursue U.S. citizenship assuming \ntheir \u201cgreen cards\u201d are granted.

(Tr. 27-28) \nAs noted, Department Counsel did not request that I take administrative notice of \nfacts about Mexico nor did he submit any documents pertaining to Mexico.

No additional facts were developed as a \npersonal conduct concern that were not already discussed under foreign influence. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe gravamen of the SOR under Guideline B for foreign influence is whether \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Mexico should disqualify him from access to classified information. \nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence, the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to business,\nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they\nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern\nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign\ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign\ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations\nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or\nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of Mexico. There is no evidence \nto suggest that the behavior of the Mexican government presents a national security \nconcern particularly as it pertains to Applicant. The heightened-risk element is satisfied \nas a result of Applicant residing with his Mexican parents who have been residing \nillegally in the United States. Given Applicant\u2019s family ties to his Mexican parents, the \nGovernment has established its case under Guideline B. The above disqualifying \nconditions are raised by the evidence. Further review is necessary. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position or having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and  \n (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \nMexico\u2019s relationship with the United States and the heightened risk it presents \nplace a burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With that said, Applicant \nhas multiple indicators that he is a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. \nHe was serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. He appears to have cooperated \nfully and provided truthful information during the security clearance process and during \nhis interview with an OPM investigator. He made a good impression upon me during the \nhearing. \n6 \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Mexico via his parents. \nApplicant has a demonstrated record that he is a responsible, reliable, and hard working \nyoung adult eager to take advantage of the opportunities of working for a defense \ncontractor. Given the fact that Applicant\u2019s parents originally came from Mexico, he \nunderstands and is sensitive to the nature of the security concern based on foreign \ninfluence. Having been born, raised, and educated in the United States, Applicant has a \nclose relationship with the United States. His parents are hard working and productive \nillegal residents of the United States, who have applied for a change in their immigration \nstatus to permanent residents, which includes disclosure of their current address to the \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Applicant\u2019s family ties to Mexico cannot be \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndismissed; however, the strength of those ties are diminished given the facts and \ncircumstances here. On balance, his ties to the United States are far stronger than the \nfamily ties to Mexico. \nGiven the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Mexican government or his parents who have \nMexican citizenship. I further conclude there is no conflict of interest, because Applicant \nhas developed such deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates that he can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in the favor of \nthe United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior . . . ; (2) any . . . inappropriate behavior; and (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are established as well as the general concerns discussed \nin AG \u00b6 15. Applicant is living in his parents\u2019 home. His parents are citizens of Mexico \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nresiding illegally in the United States. This situation has created a situation that has \nraised concerns under this guideline. Further review is necessary. \nConditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nFull application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(e) and 17(g) is appropriate under this concern. \nApplicant has been completely \u201cup front\u201d from the onset of his background investigation \nabout his parents\u2019 situation. The evidence supports the notion that Applicant\u2019s parents \nare decent hard-working people who wanted to provide the best they could for their \nchildren. They have applied to the INS for permanent residence status. They are \nrelying on their immigration attorney, who has predicted that they should be receiving \ntheir \u201cgreen cards\u201d in short order. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988), and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I have weighted the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden or persuasion to show \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleged that Applicant incurred eight delinquent debts owed to creditors, on accounts that were charged off or placed for collection totaling approximately $39,490.

In his answer, Applicant admits allegations 1.a., 1.f., 1.g., and \n1.h.  He denies allegations 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated \nDecember 10, 2019; and June 23, 2021, confirm this indebtedness.  (Government \nExhibits 3 and 4.)   \nApplicant joined the U.S. Army in 2010, at the age of seventeen, and served as a \nCombat Medic until he was honorably discharged in 2014. During his military career, he \nhad no disciplinary issues, and held a security clearance without incident. He was \nmarried to his high school sweetheart from 2011 to 2014. After leaving the military in \n2014, Applicant attended a law enforcement academy using the GI Bill. \nAfter \ngraduating with his law enforcement license, he worked for two years as a police officer. \nHe then left the force to pursue different career opportunities. \nIt was about this time in 2015/2016 that Applicant began to experience financial \nproblems. Although he had employment, he incurred delinquent debts that he did not \npay. Applicant attributes most of his financial problems and indebtedness to poor \nfinancial management. In 2017, Applicant applied for and started receiving VA disability \nbenefits. \nIn February 2021, Applicant was laid off from his job with a previous employer. \nTwo weeks later, he was hired by his current employer. A month later, in March 2021, \nApplicant hired a Credit Repair Service to assist him in resolving his delinquent debt in \norder to be eligible for a security clearance.

Accordingly, this allegation is \nfound against the Applicant. \nb. A delinquent debt owed to Child Support Services in the amount of $3,793 was \nten days past due.  Applicant made a payment of $2,715 between April 7, 2021, \nand April 9, 2021.  (Tr. p. 66.)  The debt has been paid in full.  Applicant asserts \nthat he now has a monthly child support obligation of $650 that is automatically \ndeducted out of his payroll check.  He is current with this account at this time.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, page 8.)  Accordingly, this allegation is found \nfor the Applicant.   \nc.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $321 was placed for \ncollection.  Applicant paid the debt in the amount of $320.51 on April 8, 2021.  (Tr. \np. 66.)  The debt has been paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, page \n4.)  Accordingly, this allegation is found for the Applicant.   \nd.

A delinquent debt owed to a Real Estate Management Company in the amount of \n$3,534 was placed for collection.  Applicant states that he broke his rental lease \nagreement on his apartment early to pursue better job opportunities.  He incurred \nthe costs related to the early move.  Applicant made two payments of $1,779 each \non April 21, 2021, and on April 22, 2021.  (Tr. p. 66.)  The debt has been paid in \nfull.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, page 2.)

His girlfriend now lives with him and shares the household expenses.  She earns \nabout $20 an hour and works full time. After paying his regular monthly expenses, \nApplicant has about $100 to $200 left at the end of every month.  (Tr. p. 56.)  He intends \nto pay his past-due delinquent debts, but based upon his current financial budget it is \nnot realistic at this time. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application dated November 4, 2019. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) In response to Section 26, Financial, he was asked, \u201cIn the \npast seven years have you had any possessions or property voluntarily or involuntarily \nrepossessed or foreclosed? . . . In the past seven years have you defaulted on any type \nof loan? . . . In the past seven years have you had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? . . . In the past seven years, have you had any account or credit card \nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed? . . . In the past seven \nyears have you been over 120 days delinquent on any debt not previously entered? . . . \nAre you currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNo,\u201d \nand failed to list that he had been delinquent on debts in the past seven years, as noted \nin Guideline F above. \nApplicant testified that he was so negligent with his delinquent debts that he \nreally did not think about them when he answered the questions on the security \nclearance application. \nHe states that he did not deliberately try to deceive the \ngovernment by not revealing them, he simply did not think about them at all. (Tr. pp. \n58-59.) Applicant knew he had delinquent debts at the time he completed the security \nclearance application, and was dishonest, careless and negligent by not disclosing \nthem. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nSince 2015/2016, Applicant incurred significant delinquent debt that he has not \npaid. At this time there is insufficient information in the record to conclude that he is \nfinancially stable, or that he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has the financial resources \navailable to handle his financial obligations. There is no evidence in the record to show \nthat any regular monthly payments of any sort are being made toward his outstanding \ndebts.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has paid off several of his small debts, and has recently hired a credit \nrepair company to assist him with the others. At this time, he remains excessively \nindebted and from the evidence presented, he is unable to afford to resolve his \nsignificant remaining delinquent debts. None of the mitigating conditions apply. This \nguideline is found against the Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reveal that he was very far behind on several accounts \nat the time he completed the security clearance application in November 2019.  This is \na classic case of doing nothing to resolve one\u2019s delinquent debts for many years, and \nthen when it matters, trying to do everything possible, which is simply not enough.  Too \nlittle, too late. It can be presumed that Applicant knew about his delinquent debts at the \ntime he completed the security clearance application.  Applicant deliberately concealed \nhis financial delinquencies from the Government on this application.  There is no excuse \nfor this dishonesty.  Deliberately concealing material information from the Government \non a security clearance application raises serious questions about one\u2019s credibility and \ntrustworthiness.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  This guideline is \nfound against the Applicant.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Insufficient mitigation has been \nshown. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.h.  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Applicant admitted owing six medical debts totaling approximately \n$2,914. These debts are in relation to a serious medical condition of his wife in 2019. \nApplicant is working with a collection agency to resolve all of these debts. He has been \nmaking timely payments to the agency pursuant to a payment arrangement and has \nreduced the debts to $1,290, as shown by documents from the agency. These debts are \nbeing resolved. (Tr. 37-42, 53, 55-56; Applicant Exhibits 2D and 2E.) \n1.h. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $334 for an account placed for collection. \nApplicant made a payment arrangement with a collection agency starting in December \n2019. He made consistent monthly payments and repaid the debt in February 2020. This \ndebt has been resolved. (Tr. 42-43; Answer attachment; Applicant Exhibit D.) \n1.i. Applicant admitted having a vehicle repossessed in approximately 2015. Once \nagain Applicant had bought this vehicle for the use of his wife, who was living in another \nstate. She refused to make payments, and the vehicle was repossessed. Applicant was \nuncertain of the status of this debt. He submitted a recent credit report dated September \n19, 2021. (Applicant Exhibit 2A.) That credit report indicates this debt is a \u201cPaid charge-\noff.\u201d The report further indicates, \u201cAccount paid for less than full balance.\u201d (Applicant \nExhibit 2A at 4-6.) Given the state of the record, this allegation is found for Applicant due \nto lack of current evidence that it is still owing. (Tr. 43-45, 52.) \n1.j. Applicant admitted having a vehicle repossessed in approximately 2018 or \n2019. Applicant testified that he attempted to resolve this repossession before the \nautomobile was sold, but he was unsuccessful. Applicant does not feel that he should be \nresponsible for this account, since he was able and willing to resolve it when the finance \ncompany sold the car. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 34, 44-46.) \nApplicant stated that his current financial situation is stable. He is able to pay his \ndebts, support his daughter, and continue to support his wife. He has received financial \ncounseling and created a budget. As stated, he submitted a credit report dated \nSeptember 19, 2021. It states on page 30 of Applicant Exhibit 2A, \u201cClean slate!

Applicant \ndenied the single allegation under this paragraph. \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Department of \nDefense in April 2019. The investigator prepared a detailed Report of Investigation (ROI). \n(Government Exhibit 2 at 4-13.) The interview was extensive, and the investigator \ncovered with Applicant all the debts set forth in Paragraph 1, above. The interview also \ncovered debts that had a zero balance. Applicant stated in his Answer, \u201cIn my previous \ninvestigations I admitted to the debt. My previous investigations accounted for my \nfinancial matters.\u201d \nApplicant filled out an e-QIP on September 9, 2019. (Government Exhibit 1.) \nSection 26 asked various questions about Applicant\u2019s financial status. He admitted the \ndebt set forth in SOR 1.a. He then answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to having any other delinquencies. \nThis was a false answer to a relevant question about Applicant\u2019s financial condition. In \nhis Answer Applicant stated, \u201cAll of these discrepancies have been addressed previously \nin my interview for renewing my secret clearance several years back, as well as my \ninterview for my initial TS in 2017. Reading through my entire SI [Subject Interview], all of \nthese discrepancies are listed, along with the explanations I have provided here.\u201d He also \nstated a concern that the credit report he had at the time of the interview did not show \nseveral of the debts referred to by the investigator. (See Tr. 24-27, 29-35.) \nApplicant also testified extensively about his thought processes while filling out the \ne-QIP. He repeatedly stated he was confused about what debts needed to be listed, since \nhe had previously been interviewed. The following testimony is indicative: \n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m still confused by it [the e-QIP]. It\u2019s hard - - I get lost in the \nweeds - - I guess I could say - - filling these out, and I\u2019m still not sure if I \ncovered these in an investigation if they are also outside the seven-year \nwindow if I have to go back and read them because they are outside the \nwindow as well as already covered in the investigation. I\u2019m still confused on \nwhat I\u2019m supposed to put in there. (Tr. 28.) \nMitigation \nApplicant is a well-respected employee. Supervisors and coworkers identify \nApplicant as a successful, respected, and honest employee and person. One coworker, \nwho is also a friend, stated the following, \u201c[Applicant] is a loyal, thoughtful, friend, a good \nfather to his daughter, a proven leader, proficient in his chosen vocation, and I\u2019m proud \nthat he is my close friend.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits A through C.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant owed approximately $41,900 for seven past-due debts and three \nautomobile repossessions as of the date the SOR was issued. These facts establish \nprima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. He is paying everyday debts and \nmaking timely payments on his consolidated medical bills in accordance with an \nagreement with the collection agency. One debt, 1.h, was resolved in full before issuance \nof the SOR. \nAll of the financial issues set forth in the SOR are related to Applicant\u2019s marriage \nin one way or another. His wife chose to live in a different state than Applicant, requiring \nhim to support two households. His wife had serious and tragic medical issues in relation \nto her second pregnancy. This resulted in the medical debts and at least one of the \nrepossessions. Applicant at first indicated a reluctance to resolve the repossessions, if \nresolution is possible. However, he now evinces a credible intent to attempt to reach an \nagreement with the creditors. Applicant has behaved responsibly in resolving his debts. \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks \nomitted).  \nGiven his resources, Applicant has initiated a pragmatic approach to the \nrepayment of his past-due SOR debts and has taken significant steps to resolve the debts. \nApplicant has the knowledge and ability that will allow him to stay on a proper financial \nfooting. He has fully mitigated all the financial concern allegations in the SOR. Paragraph \n1 is found for Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant had delinquent debts. He did not fully report these facts on his e-QIP. \nThe above disqualifying condition has application to this case. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification: \n \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Defense Department several \nmonths before filling out the e-QIP at issue. During that interview all of the debts set forth \nunder Paragraph 1, and referred to in Paragraph 2, were discussed in detail. The \ntestimony elicited from Applicant showed that he was confused by the form and by his \nresponsibility to be forthcoming on the e-QIP, since the government already had \nknowledge of the debts based on prior interviews with him. Applicant\u2019s interpretation of \nwhat he was supposed to describe was wrong, but was not a willful falsification. Based \non the available evidence, I find that Applicant did not have the requisite intent to deceive \nwhen he filled out the e-QIP. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation and personal conduct. The situation regarding \nhis debts is being resolved in a responsible manner, and does not evince poor judgment \nor unreliability. Applicant\u2019s misstatements on the e-QIP do not arise to willful falsification. \nHe has minimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, as well as the likelihood \nof recurrence. Overall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 36 years old. In 2013, he married his wife and acts as a father to his 14-year-old stepdaughter. He has worked for a Federal contractor since July 2019 as a missile mechanic. He was recently placed on unpaid administrative leave after his interim security clearance was withdrawn. Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corp from 2006 to 2010. He was honorably discharged from Reserve duties in September 2014. His highest rank was E-5. (Item 3) Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, with the SOR alleged delinquent debts totaling $21,192. (Items 1 \u2013 6) According to Applicant, his financial issues worsened in approximately 2016, following loss of supplemental income, presumably the GI Bill, however, the record is unclear. There is no information as to how much supplemental income was lost, or the amount of his current income with his employer. During his background interview in September 2019, Applicant stated that he was making larger monthly payments on his delinquent accounts and he planned to accept settlement offers. He was also trying to be a better manager of his finances. He had not received or sought any financial counseling.

He failed to demonstrate that he initiated or made a consistent good-\nfaith effort to repay his creditors or resolve his alleged debts. National security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 31, 2019. On \nDecember 10, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant submitted an undated answer to the SOR and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On January 25, 2021, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a File of Relevant Material (FORM), including \npleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 6.

Applicant timely submitted a one-page personal summary and \na copy of his SOR with handwritten notes, which I labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nand B. The case was assigned to me on March 25, 2021. All of the documents are \nadmitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 36 years old. In 2013, he married his wife and acts as a father to his \n14-year-old stepdaughter. He has worked for a Federal contractor since July 2019 as a \nmissile mechanic. He was recently placed on unpaid administrative leave after his interim \nsecurity clearance was withdrawn. Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Marine \nCorp from 2006 to 2010. He was honorably discharged from Reserve duties in September \n2014. His highest rank was E-5. (Item 3) \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, with the SOR alleged delinquent debts \ntotaling $21,192. (Items 1 \u2013 6) \nAccording to Applicant, his financial issues worsened in approximately 2016, \nfollowing loss of supplemental income, presumably the GI Bill, however, the record is \nunclear. There is no information as to how much supplemental income was lost, or the \namount of his current income with his employer. During his background interview in \nSeptember 2019, Applicant stated that he was making larger monthly payments on his \ndelinquent accounts and he planned to accept settlement offers. He was also trying to be \na better manager of his finances. He had not received or sought any financial counseling. \nThe credit report from August 2019 validates the debts alleged in the SOR totaling \n$21,192. Applicant\u2019s credit report from October 2020 reflected delinquent accounts \ntotaling $20,834. None of the accounts alleged in the SOR (except SOR \u00b6 1.b) had been \nreduced or resolved as reported in the current credit report. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b for $359 from Sprint was not reflected in the current credit report. (Item 4, Item 5, Item \n6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is indebted to T-Mobile for an account placed for \ncollection in the amount of $1,002. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM submitted by the \nGovernment, was that he settled this account for $646. He did not provide any supporting \ndocumentation. The most recent credit report reflected this account as outstanding and \nunpaid. There is insufficient information to show that this debt is resolved. (Item 5, AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a delinquent account in the amount of $359 placed for collection \nby Sprint. Applicant\u2019s FORM response was that he paid this account in full last year, but \nhe failed to provide supporting documentation. The current credit report does not reflect \nthis account. I have credited Applicant with the resolution of this account. (Item 5, AE A) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e allege medical accounts placed for collection in the total \namount of $686.

In his FORM response he stated that he spoke with an \naccount representative to arrange a settlement and informed them that he had recently \nlost his job. He intended to submit proof of settlement payment arrangements with the \ncreditor once he is financially capable of making the monthly payments. The most recent \ncredit report reflected this account as outstanding and unpaid. This debt has not been \nresolved. (Item 5, AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a Flagship Credit Accept collection account in the amount of \n$10,915. In his FORM response he stated that he spoke with an account representative \nto arrange a settlement and informed them that he had recently lost his job. He intended \nto submit proof of settlement payment arrangements with the creditor once he is \nfinancially capable of making the monthly payments. The most recent credit report \nreflected this account as outstanding and unpaid. This debt has not been resolved. (Item \n5, AE A) \nApplicant provided no proof of account settlements or payments for any of the \nalleged SOR debts. In September 2019, he was placed on notice during his background \ninterview that his outstanding debts were a security concern to the Government. He told \nthe investigator that he planned to resolve many of his debts by accepting settlement \noffers from his creditors. He had over a year to contact creditors and initiate payment \narrangements, but the record shows he ignored all but one of his delinquent financial \nobligations. He has been credited with the resolution of one account in the amount of \n$359 that is no longer listed on his most recent credit report. (Item 4, Item 5, Item 6) \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response indicated that he had \u201cworked with a financial advisor,\u201d \nbut he did not provide additional details or submit supporting documentation. He \nsubmitted a partial credit report which showed he disputed most of the delinquent credit \naccounts, but he did not provide a rationale or legitimate basis for his disputes. The record \nshows that Applicant made an effort to contact his creditors and arrange future payment \nplans only after he was placed on unpaid administrative leave by his employer. He also \ninformed his creditors that he could not yet pay on any established payment plans due to \nhis current lack of income.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201cSecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that are disqualifying. The following are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence in the record is unclear as to whether Applicant\u2019s financial issues \nwere, in part, due to the loss of supplemental income from the GI Bill. Without additional \nfactual information, I cannot determine whether this was a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol. Additionally, the record lacks evidence that Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances to resolve his financial delinquencies despite being put on notice over a \nyear ago that his financial issues were a security concern to the Government. He did not \nprovide supporting documentation or a legitimate basis for any of his credit disputes. \nApplicant is credited with the resolution of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The most \nrecent credit report showed that the remaining six SOR debts totaling $20,834 are unpaid \nand unresolved. Applicant failed to demonstrate that he initiated or made a consistent \ngood-faith effort to repay his creditors or resolve his alleged debts. The vast majority of \nthe alleged debts are still outstanding, large and small, and Applicant did not provide a \nplan of how he intends to resolve any the debts, especially now that his financial situation \nhas worsened after being placed on unpaid leave. Under the current circumstances, there \nis insufficient evidence to show that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control and \nunlikely to recur. None of the mitigating conditions apply as Appellant failed to rebut or \nmitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. The record lacks \nsufficient evidence to demonstrate that he is reliable, trustworthy, and exercises good \njudgment.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 47 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor since 2015. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1994 until he was honorably discharged in 1996. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time since he was in the military. He has an associate\u2019s degree, which he earned in 1999. The most recent information available indicates that he is married with two children.

He has been employed by a defense contractor since \n2015. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1994 until he was honorably \ndischarged in 1996. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time since he \nwas in the military. He has an associate\u2019s degree, which he earned in 1999. The most \nrecent information available indicates that he is married with two children. (Items 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleges two defaulted student loans totaling $54,207 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.h); three miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling $898 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d); and three \nunpaid medical debts totaling $249 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.g). Applicant admitted owing the two \nstudent loans. He provided mixed answers regarding the remaining debts. The alleged \ndebts are listed on an August 2019 credit report, a March 2020 credit report, or both \ncredit reports. (Items 2, 5, 6) \nApplicant reported his defaulted student loans and a delinquent credit card debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b -$479) on his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), which \nhe submitted in August 2018. His explanation about his student loans has remained \nconsistent. He thought he paid off his student loans in the 2003 to 2006 timeframe. He \nwas contacted about them and made several payments, but then did not hear back from \nthe holder of the loans. His tax refund was withheld on one occasion. He did not know \nwhat institution currently held the loans, so he was unable to set up payments. He wrote \nin his response to the SOR that he was finally more financially stable than he had been \nin the past, and he fully intended to clear the loans. (Items 2-6) \nApplicant admitted owing the three miscellaneous debts, but he stated that he \nunsuccessfully attempted to pay the $479 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b; he \nreturned the item that was the basis for the $268 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c; and he paid \nthe $151 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He provided no supporting documentation, and all \nthree debts are listed on the most recent credit report in evidence. (Items 2-6) \nApplicant asserted that he paid one of the three medical debts, and was unable \nto verify the creditors for the remaining two debts. The three medical debts were listed \non the August 2019 combined credit report, but not the March 2020 Equifax credit \nreport. (Items 2, 5, 6) \nApplicant stated that he only recently started concerning himself with his credit. \nHe submitted his SF 86 in August 2019; he was interviewed in September 2019; he \nreceived and answered the SOR in late 2020 or early 2021; and he received the FORM, \nwhich advised him of the importance of documentation, in February 2021.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \ndefaulted student loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant\u2019s medical debts were minor and do not appear on the most recent \ncredit report. Those debts are mitigated. He has known about the remaining debts for \nsome period. He made assertions about paying some debts, but he did not provide \ndocumentation. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect \napplicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at \n3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). He stated he planned to pay other debts, including his \nstudent loans. However, intentions to resolve debts in the future are not a substitute for \na track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. \n11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns \narising out of Applicant\u2019s non-medical delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He indicated in his response to the SOR that he planned to file \nthe 2017 returns in the upcoming tax season. No additional information was provided \nabout the 2017 returns. (Items 3-5) \nApplicant admitted to owing the $66,772 and $24,274 child support arrearages. \nHe stated that the $24,274 delinquency was being paid by garnishment from his military \nretirement pay. He provided a copy of his retiree account statement. The statement \nshows three garnishments ordered in the amounts of $1,501, $859, and $782, but it \nonly showed $452 being deducted from his pay, likely because his pay was not enough \nto pay even one of the three garnishments. The $66,772 child support arrearages have \nincreased on each credit report in evidence, with the 2021 credit report showing a \nbalance of $71,793. (Items 3, 5-8) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that he intends to pay his debts. He admitted that his finances \nwere in bad shape, but he expected them to improve when his wife receives \nauthorization to work. (Items 3, 5) He did not respond to the FORM, so more recent \ninformation about his finances is not available. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including child support arrearages, \na defaulted auto lease, and other delinquent debts. He did not file his 2017 and 2018 \nfederal and state income tax returns when they were due. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2017 divorce from his second \nwife and high child support payments. He also was unemployed for a period in about \n2017 to 2018. His wife is an immigrant who was waiting for authorization to work in this \ncountry. \nApplicant\u2019s divorce, unemployment, and his wife\u2019s immigration status were \nbeyond his control. Filing his tax returns was within his control. In determining whether \nall of Applicant\u2019s financial problems were beyond his control and whether he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, several things stand out. Applicant could not pay \nhis child support, but he committed to the lease of a 2017 luxury car. It is \nunderstandable that Applicant wanted a nice engagement ring for his wife and wedding \nrings for both of them, but not if he could not afford to pay for them and not at the \nexpense of providing for his children. \nApplicant filed his 2018 federal and state income tax returns late. He still had not \nfiled the 2017 income tax returns as of the date of his SOR response. Failure to comply \nwith tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is \nessential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018). AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to the 2018 tax returns, but not the 2017 tax returns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that the $4,031 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e and the $63 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g were paid. I am giving him the benefit of the doubt and crediting \nhim with resolving those debts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g are concluded for Applicant. \nThere is no evidence of payments toward the remaining SOR debts. He stated \nthat he intends to pay his debts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",
