On September 27, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert J.\nTuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because the\nJudge erred in his findings as to the date Applicant immigrated to the U.S., the date he became a U.S.\ncitizen, and the extent of his telephone contact with his mother, father, and sister in Taiwan.  He also\nargues the Judge erred in his weighing of the evidence.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s\narguments persuasive.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nThe Judge\u2019s findings as to the date Applicant immigrated to the U.S., the date he became a\nU.S. citizen, and the extent of his telephone contact with his mother, are based on substantial\nevidence.    The Judge\u2019s findings as to the extent of Applicant\u2019s telephone contact with his sister and\n1\nfather constitute either reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the record evidence or\nharmless error in that they would not change the outcome of the case.   Applicant has not met his\n2\nburden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to his circumstances of\nsecurity concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are\nsustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at\n7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\n\nDecision at 5-8.\n3\n3\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.   The Judge gave Applicant partial\n3\ncredit under the relevant mitigating conditions, but reasonably explained why the evidence which\nApplicant had presented was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The\nJudge\u2019s decision exhibits a discerning weighing of a number of variables to reach a commonsense\ndetermination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.  In so doing, the Judge articulated a reasonable concern that\nApplicant's circumstances created a conflict of interest that could potentially make him vulnerable\nto coercion, exploitation or pressure.  That security concern is based on close family ties in Taiwan,\nconsidered in the context of the overall political/security profile of that country vis-a-vis the United\nStates.  Applicant offers an alternative interpretation of the record evidence.  However, that\nalternative interpretation of the record evidence is insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s interpretation\narbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13,\n2006).  The Judge has articulated a rational explanation for his unfavorable determination under the\ndisqualifying and mitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there is sufficient record\nevidence to support that determination\u2014given the standard that required the Judge to err on the side\nof national security.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 06-04371 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2007).\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D. Hipple\nMichael D.

On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a\nmemorandum directing application of revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the Directive in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on available information, DOHA\nadjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him access to classified information and submitted the case to an\nadministrative judge for a security determination.  Applicant answered the SOR and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA received his answer to the SOR on January 8, 2007. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 24, 2007. On May 29, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was\nissued convening a hearing on June 20, 2007. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The\ngovernment presented two exhibits, marked GE 1 and 2, to support the SOR. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf, and presented two exhibits, marked AE A and B. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.)\non June 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of facts. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old senior systems (software) engineer who has worked for a\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) contractor since February 2004. He was born, raised, and educated\nin the Republic of China (Taiwan). In 1979, at age 22, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer\nscience from a Taiwanese university (Tr. 18). He then served two years of mandatory military service\nin the Taiwanese Army. Because of his education, he was assigned as a sergeant in a supply unit. He\nclaimed he only performed administrative duties and supervised a squad of men. After his discharge,\nApplicant worked as a computer programer for a shoe manufacturing company until December 1983\n(Tr. 32). \nApplicant met his wife in Taiwan, and they were married in December 1982. She was born\nin Taiwan, but had lived in the United States with her siblings since age 15. He and his wife\nemigrated to the United States in early 1984. Initially, they lived with his wife\u2019s siblings, who had\nemigrated to the United States in 1981 and were legal resident aliens. He and his wife became\nnaturalized U.S. citizens in 1989. They have two sons, both of whom were born in the United States.\nThe oldest son was born in March 1984. He works for a pharmaceutical and life science company\nconducting research. The young son was born in November 1989. He is a junior in high school.\nApplicant has taught his children to be loyal to the United States, and to be involved in their\n\n  I note one of Applicant\u2019s contacts stated in his interview with a government investigator (AE B) that Applicant\n2\ntraveled to Taiwan in 2005.\n4\ncommunity by working as volunteers for the fire department and the rescue squad. His wife has\nworked at an elementary school as an administrative assistant for the last eight years (Tr. 50).\nIn February 1987, Applicant completed a master\u2019s degree in computer science at a U.S.\nuniversity (Tr. 36). Since then, he has worked on the east coast of the United States with different\ncompanies, but always in the information technology field (software, and computer programing) (GE\n1). In 2004, Applicant started working with his current employer. He was told his Taiwanese\ncitizenship would adversely affect his ability to receive access to classified information. In December\n2004, Applicant renounced his Taiwanse citizenship (AE A). In 2005, he was issued interim access\nto classified information by his employer, however, he never handled any classified information (Tr.\n98).\nHe has traveled with his family to Taiwan three times since his arrival to the United States;\nin 1991 to celebrate his father\u2019s 70  birthday, in 1999 to visit with his family, and in 2001 to\nth\ncelebrate his father\u2019s 80  birthday.  They visited with his family in Taiwan for approximately two\nth\n2\nweeks each time.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is 69 years old. She was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China (China)\n(Tr. 54). She has been a citizen and resident of Taiwan since around 1949. She lived with Applicant\nfor many years babysitting his children while he and his wife worked. She used to spend\napproximately half of the year in the United States and the other half in Taiwan. In 1990, she became\na permanent resident alien of the United States (Tr. 56). Her husband developed cancer of the vocal\ncords and she moved back to Taiwan to take care of him. As of the day of the hearing, she was living\nin Taiwan. Applicant claimed that it is not likely his mother will return to the United States because\nshe is too old, and they don\u2019t have the money for her airplane fare. She has been retired for 17 years.\nShe used to work for a private company as a telephone operator. According to Applicant, his mother\ndoes not have any relatives in China, except for a sister-in-law with whom she does not have contact.\nApplicant has contact with his mother approximately once a week when she is in Taiwan (AE B).\nApplicant\u2019s father is 85 years old. He was born in China, but is now a citizen and resident\nof Taiwan (Tr. 63). According to Applicant, his father emigrated to Taiwan in 1949 as part of the\nChiang-Kai-shek\u2019s led movement out of China. He served in the Taiwanese Air Force, and was\ntrained to be a fighter pilot by the U.S. military around 1944. He retired holding the rank of colonel\nin 1972. He receives a military pension from the Taiwanese government. After his retirement, he\nworked for a private airline company. Applicant testified that all his father\u2019s siblings are dead, and\nhis father no longer has contact with any members of his family living in China (Tr. 70). Applicant\nhas contact with his father every two or three years when he visits Taiwan or his father visits the\nUnited States. They have telephone contact once a week.\nApplicant has a 47-year-old sister who is a resident and citizen of Taiwan. She is divorced,\nhas a 13-year-old child, and works as a nurse in a private hospital. She lives with Applicant\u2019s\nparents. Applicant has contact with his sister when he calls his parents. He also has a 40-year-old\nbrother residing on the west coast of the United States, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Applicant\n\n  AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole\n3\nperson concept.

She resides in the United States with her two\nsons and two daughters. To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, all of his siblings in-law and his mother-in-law\nare naturalized U.S. citizens (Tr. 76). Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has visited China several times. The\nlast time was two years ago when she and two of her children visited China for approximately three\nweeks (Tr. 80).\nApplicant claimed he has no contact with anyone in Taiwan or China, except for his family.\nHe has no financial ties or economic interests outside of the United States. He and his wife have\nvoted in U.S. elections since 1992.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Taiwan is a stable multi-party democracy,\nits government is friendly to the United States, and it has a good human rights record. Since the end\nof World War II, Taiwan has developed into a major international trading power and has become the\nworld's 17th largest economy. There are on-going tensions between Taiwan and China. Taiwan seeks\nto become an independent State, an aspiration which is strongly opposed by China, which sees\nTaiwan as a province of China. Despite their differences, contact between the two sides has grown\nsignificantly over the last decade. China is Taiwan\u2019s largest trading partner, and Taiwan is China\u2019s\nfifth largest. The United States has recognized China as the only legal government of China, and that\nTaiwan is part of China. Exs. I through XIII.\nAdditionally, I take administrative notice of Taiwan's active and historic roles as collector\nof competitive information and perpetrator of industrial espionage against U.S. companies producing\nmilitarily critical technologies such as information systems, sensors and lasers, and electronics.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines (AG) which must be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. The administrative judge must take\ninto account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each AG applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. The guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an Applicant. Each decision must reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the whole person concept.3\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is the\napplicable relevant AG.\n\n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n  ISCR Case No. 98-0761, at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n5\nthan a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199, at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006)(Substantial evidence is\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record); Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, supra n.8, at 528, 531.\n6\n  See Id.; AG \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n6\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n4\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a\ncompelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. \nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the\nSOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case\n5\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution\n6\nof any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information in favor\nof protecting national security.7\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision\nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express\nor implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865,\n\u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the government\u2019s concern is that foreign\ncontacts and interests may be a security concern. If the individual has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, he or she may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.

Feb. 8,\n8\n2001).\n7\nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying in this case, including:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group,\nor country by providing that information;\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter\nof law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and\nan applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for\nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.  Applicant\n8\nhas frequent contacts and a close relationship of affection and/or obligation with his parents and\nsister, who are residents and citizens of Taiwan. These contacts create a heightened risk of foreign\npressure or attempted exploitation because there is the possibility that Taiwanese or Chinese agents\nmay exploit the opportunity to obtain intelligence, classified, or economic information about the\nUnited States. His connection to his family members also create a potential conflict of interest\nbecause his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to help\nthem or the governments of Taiwan or China by providing sensitive or classified information. \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially disqualifying\nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.\nThree foreign influence mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to these\ndisqualifying conditions:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and\nthe interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest; and\n\n  The focus is not the country or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they impose. This\n9\napproach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the level of security concern or threat\nit presents to the United States. \n8\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I conclude\nthat none of the mitigating conditions apply. The evidence shows Applicant has strong feelings of\naffection and a strong sense of obligation to his parents and sister. The closeness of the relationship\nis shown by Applicant\u2019s telephone contacts with his parents and sister. His travels to Taiwan\nunderscore his deep feelings of affection and/or obligation to his family. Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s\ntravels to the United States to assist Applicant raising his children also indicated the closeness of the\nfamilial relationship. \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be exploited, I\nconsidered Taiwan\u2019s and China\u2019s forms of government.  Taiwan is a multi-party democracy. Its\n9\ngovernment is friendly to the United States, and has a good human rights record. Notwithstanding\nTaiwan\u2019s desire for independence, the United States has recognized China as the only legal\ngovernment of China, and that Taiwan is part of China. China is a nuclear power and its government\nis a rival of the United States. China is an authoritarian, Communist state with a poor human rights\nrecord. More importantly for security purposes, China aggressively seeks classified and\nindustrial/economic information from the United States. Chinese agents may attempt to use\nApplicant\u2019s family living in Taiwan to obtain such information. Additionally, Taiwan\u2019s historically\nactive role as a collector of competitive information and perpetrator of industrial espionage against\nUnited States, coupled with Taiwan\u2019s trading interests, and their trading relationship with China,\nheighten the security concerns. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, Applicant did not establish it is unlikely he will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his family and the interests of\nthe United States. His frequent contacts and close relationship with his family could potentially force\nhim to choose between the United States and Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s parents are known to the\nTaiwanese and Chinese government, because of his status as a retired colonel in the Taiwanese\nArmy, Applicant\u2019s resignation of his Chinese citizenship in 2004, and his mother-in-law travels to\nChina. Applicant\u2019s family in Taiwan remains vulnerable. He did not meet his burden of showing\nthere is little likelihood that his relationship with his family could create a risk for foreign influence\nor exploitation.\nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and\nloyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nUnited States\u2019 interest. He has lived in the United States for approximately 23 years. He and his wife\nare naturalized U.S. citizens, and their two sons were born in the United States. All of his financial\nand business interests are in the United States, and he has embraced the American way of life.\nAlthough this mitigating condition is partially applicable, these facts are insufficient to overcome\nthe security concerns.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable AGs. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s answers to the\n\n9\nSOR, his testimony, his favorable information in his report of investigation (AE B), that he and his\nwife have been naturalized U.S. citizens for 18 years, and their sons were born in the United States.\nI also considered that there is no evidence that he has ever mishandled or cause the compromise of\nclassified information. Considering all available information, and the whole person concept, I find\nApplicant has not mitigated the foreign influence security concern.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive\nSection E3.1.25 are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.d\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns over his continuing financial problems,\nincluding medical debts and other debts as well as an involuntary repossession of his car in 2001.\nWhile he stated in 2006 that he had an intent to develop a plan to resolve his problems, he provided\nno evidence that he has paid any of his outstanding debts or to demonstrate sufficient positive\nchanges in behavior.  Consequently, security concerns remain over finances.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\n\n       This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended by Change 4, April 20, 1999.   \n       Applicant did receive a copy of the DoD Directive 5220.6 which was sent with his Statement of Reasons\n2\n(SOR).\n       He was allowed additional time to submit letters of reference or evaluations, but did not submit any such\n3\nevidence.  (TR 40-41)\n2\nto the Applicant on January 04, 2007.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over\n1\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F) in paragraph 1 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines2\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, to be effective\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer of January\n16, 2007 where he admitted all of the allegations, but did not request a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel on September 10, 2007, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\nwhich was provided to Applicant on September 14, 2007, which he received on September 20, 2007,\ndetailing the Government\u2019s evidence and his right to respond.  However he provided no response\nbefore the October 20, 2007, deadline.  The case was assigned to me on November 9, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\nApplicant, 63 years old, has worked as a security guard for a defense contractor  from\n3\nOctober 2002 to present.  He now earns $8 per hour.  He was previously granted a Secret clearance\nin 1980.   Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) to obtain a security\nclearance in April 2005.  Previously, he worked as a security guard for other employers.  He has no\ndegree.  (Exhibits 3, 4)  Applicant has served in the military from July 1963 to November 1965.\n(Exhibit 1) He was married in 1969, has one child and was divorced in 1981.  (Exhibit 4) He\ncurrently has no one financially dependent on him.  (Exhibits 3, 4, 5)\nFinances\nApplicant disclosed on his SF-86 that he had a car repossessed in 2002, an unpaid judgment\nfrom 2003, and had other delinquencies.   While he stated in 2006 that had an intent to take care of\nhis debts, he failed to do so as he has limited income.  His overall debts total over $18,000.  Those\ndebts include several to medical providers (SOR \u00b61.a.to \u00b61.d., \u00b61.f., and \u00b61.i.), furniture (SOR \u00b61.e.),\na $9,877 debt from a 2001 car repossession (SOR \u00b61.j.), and a debt for tires. (SOR 1.k.) Also, he has\nnot resolved a judgment of $4,895 from 2001. (SOR 1.\u00b6l) Finally, he has an unresolved small credit\ncard debt of $95 referred for collection which he has not paid.  (SOR \u00b61.m.).  (Answer; Exhibits 4,\n5, 6)  He admitted all these debts and did not document any dispute with the creditors.  (Answer) Nor\nhas he contacted any individuals to help him resolve his debt issues on his limited income. He has\nnever taken any classes on financing or budgeting.  He reported no savings, and he submitted no plan\n\n     Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n4\n3\nto pay any of the debts.\n \n Applicant\u2019s current monthly rent is $425, car payment $477, cell phone $51, and car\ninsurance is $81.  He did not disclose any other expenses, such as food and utilities.  He lives beyond\nhis means with take home pay of $1,030 per month based on his pay of $8 per hour.  (Exhibit 5)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility which  are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding whether\nto grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the mere presence or absence\nof any adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a\nwhole in evaluating this case, I weighed these relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines:\nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations\n18. The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, clack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead\nto financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is merely\n4\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n4\nFinancial Considerations\n     \nThe government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems reflected\nhis car being repossessed, a judgement unpaid, medical and other expenses which remain upaid. \nConsequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and DC, AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.  While he hoped to\nresolve these debts in 2006, he has made no demonstrable efforts to resolve his credit problems\nwhich continue to raise security concerns.  He failed to consult any sources for help with credit\ncounseling, nor has he contested or paid any of these numerous debts. Thus, Applicant has not\nestablished a case in mitigation.  For example, he provided no evidence under Mitigating Condition\n(MC) AG \u00b6 20(c), (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). Neither was there\nsubstantial mitigating evidence under AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances).  He has been single since his divorce in 1981 and continues to accumulate debt.\nApplicant has not demonstrated that he has paid even one debt, large or small.Thus, he fails to meet\nAG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts).  While he has a position with a limited income, his failure to resolve his debts  creates\nan ongoing security concern.  \nWhole Person Analysis\nHaving considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, I\nconclude he is an sincere person who has struggled with reforming his financial practices; but he has\nnot made sufficient progress even after he has stated an intent to do so.  While stating an intent to\nresolve his debts in May 2006 during the investigation, he subsequently failed to change his financial\npractices and continues to live beyond his means with no resources to resolve the past debt.  His\nfailure to address the ongoing debt continues to raise security concerns. The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress is high even though he has an employment history since 2003. In\nsum, the likelihood of new debts and related problems is high. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations.  I rule against  Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a.\nthrough 1.m. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\n\n5\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  Clearance is\ndenied.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid P. Price, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of alcohol dependence. It includes alcohol-related incidents in 1999\nand 2004, and a history of counseling and treatment. He was in a codependent relationship with his\nwife for many years of their marriage. He separated from his wife in 2005, and he relocated to\nanother state where he has worked for his current employer. His divorce was final in 2006. He has\nbeen nearly alcohol free since mid-2006, and he has not consumed alcohol since December 2006.\nHe completed a nine-week substance abuse outpatient program in June 2007, and he is continuing\nwith an after-care program. He is now maintaining his sobriety and has a good understanding of his\nsituation. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on May 21, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it\ndetails the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline G for alcohol\nconsumption.  \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn June 25, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. With the agreement\nof counsel, the hearing took place as scheduled on October 2, 2007. The transcript was received on\nOctober 11, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admits all SOR allegations with explanations. In addition, based on the record\nevidence, the following facts are established. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old analyst. He has worked for his current employer, a federal\ncontractor, since January 2005. His job involves providing training and support to the Army. \nApplicant married in 1983, separated in January 2005, and divorced in March 2006. He has\ntwo adult children, a 23-year-old son and a 20-year-old daughter. Concerning his use of alcohol, he\nbelieves he was in a codependent relationship with his wife for many years of their marriage. \nHis employment history includes about 26 years of military service. In 1974, he enlisted in\nthe Air Force and served about three years before transferring to a state air national guard unit. He\nthen served in a traditional part-time role for several years. In 1982,  he began working as a full-time\nmember of the guard, as a traffic management supervisor, until his retirement in 2000. He retired due\nto a state guard policy that required retirement upon reaching 20 years of active federal service. He\nretired as a master sergeant (pay grade E7). Applicant had a highly successful military career\nreceiving nine personal awards as follows: five Air Force Achievement Medals, three Air Force\nCommendation Medals, and the Meritorious Service Medal upon his retirement (Exhibit C). He was\n\n3\nan honor graduate on two occasions, and on many  occasions he was recognized in writing for his\nefforts and accomplishments (Exhibit D). \nApplicant describes his forced retirement as devastating, because he had reached a\nprofessional high point and was forced to look for a new job as a 45-year-old man. After his\nretirement, he held several jobs (some with federal contractors) and had four periods of\nunemployment, the longest of which was about seven months in 2001. His prospects in his current\njob are good and he intends to remain there for the foreseeable future.\nApplicant has a history of alcohol dependence. It includes alcohol-related incidents in 1999\nand 2004, and a history of counseling and treatment. The first alcohol-related incident was in August\n1999, when Applicant was approaching his  retirement. He was on temporary duty in another state\nand was drinking in his hotel room on a Sunday while watching football. After having several drinks,\nhe left to get something to eat. He was involved in a traffic accident when he slightly clipped a car\nfrom behind. Given the traffic on the road and being in unfamiliar surroundings, he returned to his\nhotel and called the police to report the accident. The police arrived and he was arrested for driving\nunder the influence (DUI), negligent driving, failure to stop after an accident involving damage, and\nfailure to return and remain at the scene of the accident. His blood-alcohol level was tested and found\nto be above .1%. The case was adjudicated in 2000, when he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to\n90 days in jail (suspended), 40 hours of community service, a $200 fine, and a requirement to\ncomplete alcohol counseling.\nThe second alcohol-related incident was in about September or October 2004, when\nApplicant was unemployed and living in his marital home. Like the first incident, it was a Sunday\nand he was drinking and watching football. His wife entered the room and told him he had too much\nto drink and she was going to call the police. She did, the police arrived, and they took him to a\nhospital for detox. He spent the balance of the day playing checkers at the hospital. He was not\narrested or charged with a criminal offense and no legal proceedings resulted from the incident.\nThere is no conclusive evidence about the degree, if any, of Applicant\u2019s level of intoxication,\nalthough he agrees that he was drinking alcohol and had no plans to drive that day. This incident\nconvinced him that his marriage was irrevocably broken and led to the separation a few months later.\nHis history of counseling and treatment started in 1999 after his DUI arrest. He returned from\nthe temporary duty and, with the knowledge and support of his superiors at the guard, entered a 30-\nday outpatient program at a local Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital. He completed the program in\nOctober 1999, and then continued periodic counseling through about June 2002.\nIn about June 2002, Applicant left his marital home and moved to another state to take a job\nwith a federal contractor. He worked there until about December 2003 when he was laid off. During\nthis time, he continued to receive counseling at a local VA hospital (Exhibit 6). A staff psychiatrist\nat the VA hospital diagnosed Applicant suffering from alcohol dependency and a major depressive\ndisorder.\nAfter the second alcohol-related incident, Applicant received alcohol counseling from\nOctober to December 2004. It included participating in a support group. This activity ended when\nhe relocated to another state in January 2005 to start his current employment. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n4\nApplicant has been nearly alcohol free since mid-2006, having consumed about two to three\ndrinks during the last half of 2006 (R. 92). He has not consumed alcohol since December 2006, the\nsame month when he had a substance abuse assessment from a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram. That assessment concluded that Applicant has \u201ca long history of alcohol dependency and\nfew support systems in place to handle ongoing sobriety\u201d (Exhibit 5 at 5). The assessment\nrecommended treatment, which Applicant was agreeable to. He completed a nine-week substance\nabuse outpatient program in June 2007. He is continuing with an after-care program on a weekly\nbasis. According to a licensed clinical social worker with the program, Applicant is \u201csuccessfully\nmaintaining his sobriety and progressing in his understanding in all areas of addiction and addictive\nbehavior\u201d (Exhibit A\u2013letter, dated June 21, 2007).   \nIn addition, Applicant reconnected to the religion he was raised in by his family. He attends\nchurch regularly. Recently, he began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and is at the beginning\nstages of that process. \nConcerning the depression, Applicant is under the care of a medical doctor (psychiatrist) for\ntreatment of major depressive disorder (Exhibit A\u2013letter, dated June 27, 2007). Applicant is\ncompliant with appointments and medications, and he appears committed to addressing his issues.\nIn addition, Applicant understands that using alcohol is counterproductive to his treatment for\ndepression, as it is for his medical condition of diabetes. \nApplicant presented several character witnesses, in person and on paper, vouching for his\ngood character and trustworthiness (See witness testimony and Exhibits F\u2013L). In general terms, these\npeople, many of whom are clearance holders, describe Applicant as a productive, competent, and\nreliable employee who possesses integrity and exercises leadership.     \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n5\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n Revised Guidelines at 15\u201316 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 15. \n15\n6\nThe concern under Guideline G for alcohol consumption  is that \u201cexcessive consumption\n14\noften leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses.\u201d  In addition,\n15\nit can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s\ntwo alcohol-related incidents and his history of alcohol dependence and treatment for the same. I\nreviewed the DCs under the guideline and conclude that four apply. Each DC is briefly summarized\nand discussed below.\nThe first DC\u2014alcohol-related incidents away from work\u2014applies. His traffic accident and\nDUI arrest in 1999 plainly qualifies as an alcohol-related incident. The incident in 2004 when his\nwife called the police is a tad odd given that no criminal charges were made or brought, but it too\nwas alcohol related and falls within the meaning of this DC. Combined, these two incidents raise a\nsecurity concern.\nThe second DC\u2014alcohol-related incidents at work\u2014does not apply. There is no evidence\nthat Applicant has reported to work or duty under the influence of alcohol. Indeed, the evidence\nsuggests Applicant is a highly capable employee.  \nThe third DC\u2014habitual or binge consumption of alcohol\u2014applies. Although there is not\nconclusive evidence of binge drinking, there is sufficient evidence to support a conclusion of\nhabitual consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. His history of alcohol use and\ndependency supports this conclusion.\nThe fourth DC\u2014diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional of alcohol abuse or\nalcohol dependence\u2014applies. Applicant does not dispute this, as he received a diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence from a staff psychiatrist at a VA hospital. \nLikewise, the fifth DC\u2014evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u2014applies.\nAgain, Applicant does not dispute this, and it was confirmed as recently as December 2006 when\nhe was assessed as alcohol dependent. \nThe sixth DC\u2014relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an\nalcohol-rehabilitation program\u2014applies. Although he had periods of sobriety, he consumed alcohol\nafter his initial treatment program at the VA hospital. His drinking continued, on a periodic basis,\nuntil he ceased all alcohol consumption in December 2006. Returning to drinking in light of his\ndependence diagnosis is plainly a relapse.\nThe seventh DC\u2014failure to follow a court order\u2014does not apply. There is no evidence\nshowing Applicant violated a court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or\nabstinence. \n\n7\nThe applicable DCs raise a  concern about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified\ninformation. Taken together, they show questionable judgment and raise questions about his\nreliability and trustworthiness. \nTurning to the evidence in mitigation, I reviewed the MCs under the guideline and conclude\nthat two apply. Each MC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014applies. The record evidence shows\nthat Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption and dependence were intertwined with his marriage. He\nseparated from his wife in January 2005 and they divorced in March 2006. Since then, he has had\nlittle to drink and has been virtually alcohol free since mid-2006. These circumstances suggest that\nhis alcohol dependence was connected to his codependent relationship with his wife. Indeed, the\nsecond alcohol-related incident was tied directly to his wife. It is unlikely that additional alcohol-\nrelated incidents will recur as the marriage is over and Applicant is abstinent. Given Applicant\u2019s\nhistory, this change of circumstances deserves due consideration. \nThe second MC\u2014the individual acknowledges his alcoholism, provides evidence of actions\ntaken, and has established a pattern of abstinence\u2014applies. Applicant receives full credit under this\nMC. He knows he has a problem, is taking affirmative steps to address it, and he has been abstinent\nsince December 2006, a period of about 10 months. Although a longer period of abstinence may be\npreferable, Applicant\u2019s 10-month period, coupled with a favorable evaluation from the licensed\nclinical social worker, is sufficient to establish a pattern of abstinence.\nThe third MC\u2014the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program and has no history of previous treatment or relapse\u2014does not apply. His history\nincludes treatment at the VA followed by relapse. Accordingly, no credit is due under this MC.\nThe fourth MC\u2014the three-part reform and rehabilitation condition\u2014does not apply because\nApplicant has not satisfied the first prong of the MC. Although he completed a nine-week substance\nabuse program in 2007, he is still in the after-care program. The MC cannot be applied because he\nhas not yet completed the after-care program. \nThe record evidence has also been considered in light of the whole-person concept, and it\nsupports a conclusion that the disqualifying evidence is outweighed by the mitigating evidence. This\nconclusion is based on Applicant\u2019s well-established  actions taken to address his alcohol dependence.\nHis track record of current sobriety is relatively brief compared with his history of alcohol\ndependence, and this circumstance is a legitimate concern. It is overcome, however, by the totality\nof facts and circumstances indicative of sobriety and his commitment to remain abstinent. For\nexample, those facts and circumstances include the following: (1) his impressive record of honorable\nmilitary service for 26 years coupled with his favorable character evidence; (2) his separation and\ndivorce from his wife; (3) he has been virtually alcohol free since mid-2006 and has abstained for\nthe last ten months; and (4) he received a favorable evaluation from a licensed clinical social worker\nfrom the treatment program. Taken together, these facts and circumstances support a conclusion that\nApplicant is unlikely to relapse. \n\n8\nTo sum up, the evidence demonstrates that Applicant has insight into his alcohol dependence\nand the problems it has caused him. He is taking mature, serious steps to address it. Not only is he\ncommitted to abstinence in light of his alcohol dependence, but he understands alcohol use is\ncounterproductive to his mental and physical health (depression and diabetes). After weighing the\nfavorable and unfavorable evidence, Applicant has met his burden to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe security concern. Likewise, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. Accordingly, Guideline G is decided for Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline G:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013j:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJ. Theodore Hammer Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has a history of illegal drug\nuse as recent as 2005. He has several alcohol related arrests and continues to consume alcohol. He\nhas not received any counseling or treatment for drugs or alcohol.  He  failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns raised under drug involvement and alcohol consumption guidelines. Applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe government submitted five items in support of its contentions.\n2\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated January 11, 2007).\n3\nItem 1 (Applicant\u2019s Security Clearance application, dated June 16, 2005).\n4\nId.\n5\nItem 3 supra at note 3.\n6\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn January 11, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s written case on April 18, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material\n(FORM) on April 24, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material\nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  The case was assigned to me on June 28,\n2\n2007. Applicant did not submit additional information. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations in his SOR response under Guideline H and Guideline G.3\nThe admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the\nrecord and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduation from high\nschool, he attended college until 2005. He has worked for his current employer since April 2005.\nApplicant is not married.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n10\n3\nand Obstructing Justice. He paid $80 in fines and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service\nand placed on probation for one year.7\nOn August 23, 2002, Applicant was charged with Underage Possession of Alcohol. He pled\nno contest and his case was under advisement for 12 months. He was sentenced to 50 hours of\ncommunity service and ordered to donate $500 to a charity. 8\nAlthough he has never been arrested for drug use, he admits using marijuana  from 1998 until\n2004. During that time, he purchased and sold marijuana.  Applicant used ecstasy in 1999-2000. In\n2000-2001, Applicant used and purchased acid and mushrooms. From November 2003 until at least\nFebruary 2005, Applicant used cocaine. \nFrom 2002 until 2004, Applicant purchased and used two different prescription drugs\nillegally. Applicant admitted that he would like to try absinthe if given the opportunity. He admits\nthat the alcohol and drugs have impacted his work and family life. He also acknowledged that his\nwork performance was adversely impacted after graduating from college due to alcohol\nconsumption.\nApplicant enjoys his current position. He has been out of college for 18 months. He maintains\nthat he has not driven under the influence of alcohol for at least eight months. He also maintains that\nhe has not used drugs for at least 18 months. He continues to consume alcohol but in a controlled\nenvironment.9\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n10\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n11\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) 2 (a)(1)-(9).\n12\n Id.\n13\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n15\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n16\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n17\n4\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n11\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n12\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n13\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.14\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n15\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n16\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n17\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline G and Guideline H of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to\nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant has several arrests for alcohol-related incidents. He consumed alcohol to the point\nof intoxication numerous times between 1998 and 2006. Applicant was hospitalized for alcohol\npoisoning.  Thus, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) AG \u00b6 22 (a) alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse\nabuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\n\nAG \u00b6 24.\n18\n5\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; AC DC AG \u00b6 22 (b) alcohol-related incident\nat work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on\nthe job, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\nAC DC AG \u00b6 22 (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent, apply.\nAfter considering the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions AC MC AG \u00b6 23(a) so\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; AC MC AG \u00b6 23 (b) the individual acknowledges his or her\nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol\nabuser); AC DC AG \u00b6 23 (c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory\nprogress); AC DC AG \u00b6 23 (d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare. . . I find that none of them apply.\nApplicant has not received counseling or any treatment for his alcohol use. He continues to use\nalcohol. He drank for more than eight  years to the point of intoxication.\nApplicant has not sustained his burden of proof in this case for Guideline G. Granted he was\nin college when this happened, but since he graduated from college he engaged in the same behavior.\nSince he has not made significant behavioral changes and still consumes alcohol, the likelihood of this\nconduct recurring is high. This places him in a position where there is a possibility that he could\ndivulge classified information.\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgement and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations.18\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant used and sold\nmarijuana, cocaine and other drugs for a period of more than eight years until 2005. He admits he\nwould use absinthe in the future if provided the opportunity. Consequently, Drug Involvement\nDisqualifying Condition (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) any drug abuse, and DI DC \u00b6 25(c) illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia, apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Drug\nInvolvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) AG \u00b626 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. It does not apply because\nhe was using cocaine until 2005 and smoking marijuana in 2004.\n\n6\nApplicant provided insufficient evidence or explanation to support the DI MC AG \u00b626 (b) (a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation. In his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he would try absinthe\nif given the opportunity. Given his history of marijuana use for more than six years, and cocaine use,\nI find an insufficient proof of a demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future.\nApplicant\u2019s rationale that he has not used drugs in a year and a half does not mitigate the drug\ninvolvement security concern. The other mitigating conditions do not apply in this case.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant\u2019s recent involvement with drugs leaves doubt as to his\ntrustworthiness. I have considered his desire to put this behind him, but I conclude it is premature to\nfind in favor of Applicant.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Theodore Hammer, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nOn or about January 21, 2005, Applicant was fired from a job for taking money, without\nauthorization, from her employer.  Subsequently, she lied about the firing on a Declaration for\nFederal Employment, on a security clearance application (SF-86), executed in February 2005, and\nin an interview with an authorized investigator.  Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under\nthe Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct adjudicative guidelines.  Clearance is denied.\n\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and\n1\nmodified.\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On November 14, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and\n1\nDepartment of Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis\n2\nfor its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J\n(Criminal Conduct),  promulgated December 29, 2005, and applicable in DoD adjudications of SORs\nissued as of September 1, 2006, and thereafter. With the SOR, DOHA provided Applicant with a copy\nof DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended. \nOn December 13, 2006, Applicant filed a notarized response to the SOR.  In her response, she\nanswered the Personal Conduct allegations (SOR \u00b6 1) but did not answer the Criminal Conduct\nallegation (SOR \u00b6 2).  She requested her case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The\nGovernment compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 17, 2007.  The FORM contained\ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 8.  Item 8 of the FORM was a copy of the Department of\nDefense Directive incorporating the applicable Adjudicative Guidelines.\nOn April 20, 2007, Applicant was sent a copy of the FORM, with instructions to file objections\nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct\ndisqualifying conditions within 30 days of receipt.  On April 23, 2007, Applicant signed an\nacknowledgment of receipt of the FORM.  She did not submit any information within the 30-day time\nperiod.  On June 28, 2007, the case was assigned to me for a decision.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains five allegations under Guideline E,  Personal Conduct, and one allegation\nunder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  Applicant admitted all five Guideline E allegations.  She did\nnot address the Guideline J allegation, which identified three of the Guideline E allegations as criminal\nconduct pursuant to 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1001.  I interpret Applicant\u2019s failure to respond to the Criminal\nConduct allegations in the SOR as a general denial of the allegations.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact.  (Item 6, Item 7.)\nApplicant is 24 years old, unmarried,  and employed as a staff auditor by a defense contractor.\nShe graduated from college in May 2005 and holds a bachelor of science degree in accounting. (Item\n2, Item 4.)\nFrom March 2003 until about January 21, 2005, Applicant was employed as a\nbartender/waitress at a club in a resort community.  She ran low on money and was overdue on a\n\n3\npayment owed to her personal trainer.  In order to pay her debt to the trainer, Applicant took $120 from\nher employer\u2019s petty cash bag without the employer\u2019s permission.  She left a note in the petty cash bag\nexplaining she had taken the money and planned to pay it back.  Applicant\u2019s unauthorized use of the\nemployer\u2019s petty cash was a violation of company policy.  She was fired for theft by the employer on\nabout January 21, 2005.  (Item 2, Item 5, Item 7.)  (SOR \u00b6 1.a.)\nIn her notarized answer to the SOR, Applicant stated:\nI was indeed fired from my employment with [Employer] for theft.  I\nhad endured a financial hardship I had never experienced before.  I did\ntake some money from the petty cash bag so I could pay a bill but I had\nevery intention to give it back.   I did indeed pay back the money;\nhowever, my employer made the decision to terminate my employment\nanyways.  (Item 7 at 2.)\nOn January 25, 2005, Applicant signed a Declaration for Federal Employment, Optional Form\n306 (OF 306).  Question 11 on the OF 306 reads as follows: \nDuring the last 5 years, were you fired from any job for any reason, did\nyou quit after being told that you would be fired, did you leave any job\nby mutual agreement because of specific problems, or were you\ndebarred from Federal employment by the Office of Personnel\nManagement?  If \u201cYes, use Item 15 to provide the date, an explanation\nof the problem and reason for leaving, and the employer\u2019s name and\naddress.\nAppellant responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 11, and she failed to list the fact she had been fired for\ntheft on or about January 21, 2005.  (Item 1.) ( SOR \u00b6 1.b.)  After executing the OF 306, Applicant\nsigned and dated the following certification, which appears as Item 16 on the OF 306:\nI certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, all of the\ninformation on and attached to this Declaration for Federal\nEmployment, including any attached application materials, is true,\ncorrect, complete, and made in good faith.  I understand that a false or\nfraudulent answer to any question on any part of this declaration or its\nattachments may be grounds for not hiring me, or for firing me after I\nbegin to work, and may be punishable by fine or imprisonment.\nOn February 2, 2005, Appellant sought employment with  Department of Defense agency A.\nShe executed and signed a security clearance application (SF-86).  Question 20 on the SF-86 reads as\nfollows:\nYour Employment Record\nHas any of the following happened to you in the past 7 years?\n\u2013Fired from a job\n\u2013Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired\n\nIn her signed affidavit, executed in June 2005, Applicant asserted that when she executed her SF-86 on\n3\nFebruary 2, 2005, she was still employed by her employer and had not yet been fired.  In her response to SOR allegation\n1.a., Applicant admitted she was fired by her employer for theft on January 21, 2005. (Item 5; ITem 7.)\n4\n\u2013Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct\n\u2013Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance\n\u2013Left a job for other reason under unfavorable circumstances\nAppellant responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 20.    Item 43 on the SF-86 is entitled \u201cGeneral\n3\nRemarks\u201d and asks: \u201cDo you have any additional remarks to enter in your application?\u201d  Applicant\nresponded \u201cyes\u201d to Item 43 and stated: \u201cIn reference to my credit card debt I am trying to get both of\nthose debts settled.  As a full time student I only work part time so it is going to be a few months\nbefore I can settle them.\u201d (Item 2 at 5-6, 9.)\nAfter executing the SF-86, Applicant signed and dated the following certification:\nCERTIFICATION BY PERSON COMPLETING FORM\nMy statement on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and\ncorrect to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I\nunderstand that a  knowing and willful false statement on this form can be\npunished by fine or imprisonment or both.  (See section 1001 of title 18, United\nStates Code).\n(Item 2.) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 2.a.)\nApplicant was subject to a security investigation, as she was under consideration for a position\nthat required eligibility for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).  She was\ninterviewed by a Department of Defense authorized investigator on April 28, 2005.  In response to\nquestions about leaving her bartender/waitress job with the club at the resort, Applicant stated she left\nthe job because she was not making enough money.  She also stated she had no problems in that\nemployment and received no disciplinary actions   (Item 3.)  She failed to disclose she had been fired\nfrom the job for stealing her employer\u2019s money.  (SOR \u00b6 1.d.)\nOn June 3, 2005, Applicant was interviewed again by an authorized investigator of the U.S.\nOffice of Personnel Management.  Pursuant to that interview, she signed an affidavit admitting she had\nbeen fired from her bartended/waitress job for stealing money from her employer to pay her personal\ntrainer.  She attributed her failure to admit she had been fired in her April 2005 interview to\nnervousness. (Item 5.)\nDefense agency A served Applicant with a statement of reasons and an undated memorandum\nstating its intent TO deny her eligibility for access to SCI, due, in part, to her personal conduct and the\nfact she failed to disclose she had been fired from her job in January 2005 for unlawfully taking money\n\nBecause Agency A\u2019s letter of intent and statement of reasons are not dated, it is unclear whether Applicant\n4\nwithdrew her application before or after receiving these communications.\n5\nfrom her employer.  On or about February 7, 2006, Applicant withdrew her application for eligibility\nfor access to SCI as an employee of agency A.   (Item 3, Item 7.)  (SOR \u00b6 1.e.)\n4\nApplicant sought employment with a federal contractor.  As a part of her employment process,\nshe executed, signed, and certified a second SF-86 on July 1, 2005.  She again responded \u201cno\u201d to\nQuestion 20, which asked whether she had ever been fired from any job in the last seven years. (Item\n4)\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant asserted her belief she was a person of integrity who had\nmade a bad decision and that \u201c[her] continuous unwillingness to disclose information regarding [her]\nprevious employment is not a reflection of [her] character.\u201d (Item 7.) \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[No one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens\n\u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength\nof character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom\nfrom conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by\nregulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968,\nAccess to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  \nBy Memorandum dated August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense directed\nimplementation of revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, promulgated December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006, as modified. The\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines replaced the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to DoD Directive\n5220.6 and Appendix 8 to DoD 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other determinations\nin which a SOR had not been issued by September 1, 2006.  Accordingly, since the SOR in this case\nwas issued November 14, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines apply.\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth personal security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions  and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In evaluating the security\nworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\n\n6\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nPersonal Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.  Guideline E, \u00b6 15.   \nApplicant completed and signed a OF 306 on January 25, 2005.  On that form, in response to\nQuestion 11, she denied being fired from a job in the previous five years.  On February 2, 2005, \nApplicant executed, signed, and certified a SF-86.  In her response to Question 20 on both versions\nof the SF-86, Applicant denied being fired from a job in the past seven years.  When she was\ninterviewed by an authorized investigator in April 2005, Applicant lied about her reason for leaving\nthe job from which she had been fired.  She said she left the job because it did not pay her enough, and\nshe denied she had any problems with or disciplinary actions from her employer.  Then, in a signed\naffidavit witnessed by an authorized investigator in June 2005, Applicant admitted taking $120 from\nher employer\u2019s petty cash, which violated the employer\u2019s policy, and being fired because she took the\nemployer\u2019s money without authorization.  Through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence,\nthe Government established a prima facie case that Applicant falsified her answers to Question 11 on\nthe OF-306, to Question 20 on the SF-86, and to the investigator\u2019s inquiries what caused her to leave\nher job on January 21, 2005.  The burden of proof thus shifted to Applicant to rebut or mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s allegations.  Applicant admitted the falsifications and attributed them in part to\nnervousness.  She asserted she was a person of reliable character who had made a bad decision. \nUnder Guideline E, a security concern is raised by an individual\u2019s deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities. Guideline E, \u00b6 16(a).  Applicant\u2019s admitted conduct also raises\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 16(b), and 16 (e)(1).  DC 16(b)\nreads as follows: deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to\n\nDC 31(c) reads: \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\n5\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n7\nan employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative. DC 16(e)(1) reads as follows: personal conduct, or concealment of information about\none\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding.  \nTwo Guideline E mitigating conditions (MC) might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s conduct.\nPursuant to MC 17(a), personal conduct security concerns might be mitigated if the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts.  Pursuant to MC 17(e), personal conduct security concerns might be\nmitigated if the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress.\nApplicant provided no credible evidence to mitigate her failure to disclose she had been fired\nfor theft on her OF 306 and SF-86.  Applicant was a mature adult with a college education when she\nfailed to disclose she had been fired for cause. Although she knew, or should have known, the\nimportance of telling the truth to the Government, she had reason to attempt to conceal this derogatory\ninformation about her trustworthiness.  Her assertions that her falsifications were due to nervousness\nwere not credible. She did not make good-faith efforts to correct her omissions, concealment, or\nfalsifications before being confronted with the facts, and she did not take positive steps to reduce or\neliminate the vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress caused by her concealment of this\nderogatory information relating to her lack of trustworthiness.  I conclude that MC 17(a) and MC 17(e)\ndo not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nApplicant falsified her response to Question 11 on her January 25, 2005 OF 306 by denying\nshe had been fired from a job in the past five years.  She also falsified her response to Question 20 on\nthe SF-86 she executed, signed, and certified on February 2, 2005 by  denying she had been fired from\na job in the past seven years. She deliberately concealed this information from an authorized\ninvestigator in a security interview. She failed to offer credible information in mitigation or to rebut\nthe Government\u2019s prima facie case that her falsifications were deliberate and therefore criminal\nconduct under 18 U.S.C. section 1001.\nCriminal conduct creates a security concern because it raises doubts about an individual\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Additionally, it raises doubts about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal activity raises\nsecurity concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) 31(c)  of Guideline J.\n5\nTwo mitigating conditions under Guideline J might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct might be mitigated under Mitigating Condition (MC) 32(a) if\nshe provided credible evidence to show that so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  MC 32(d) might apply\n\n8\nif there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal behavior took place in January 2005, approximately 2 \u00bd years ago.  She\nperpetuated the criminal conduct by lying on her OF 306 and SF-86 and by lying to an authorized\ninvestigator in April 2005.  It wasn\u2019t until she was interviewed a second time by an authorized\ninvestigator in June 2005 that she admitted her criminal conduct.  Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is\nrecent and it casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  She provided no\ncredible evidence that her conduct would not recur. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant continued to\ninsist upon her good character and trustworthiness, but she provided no credible evidence that she\ncomprehended the seriousness of her actions and she failed to offer evidence of successful\nrehabilitation.  Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct raises serious doubts not only about her reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment but also about her ability to follow laws, rules, and regulations.\nApplicant failed to provide credible evidence under MC 32(a) and MC 32(d) to mitigate the criminal\nconduct alleged in the SOR.  No other MCs apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, an\nadministrative judge must thoroughly consider and review all available reliable information about the\nappellant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.  DoD Directive\n5220.6, as amended, describes this process of scrutiny and evaluation as \u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d\nThe factors to be considered in a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and seriousness of\nthe conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the\nvoluntariness of participation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral\nchanges; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand, the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nI do not find, under a whole person analysis, that Applicant\u2019s decision to withdraw her\napplication for access to SCI with Agency A reflected negatively on her personal conduct under\nGuideline E.  Accordingly, I find for Applicant on SOR allegation 1.e.\nApplicant is well-educated and holds a college degree.  Her admissions and the record\nevidence establish she took money from her employer and was fired for doing so.  She deliberately\nfalsified  her OF 306 and SF-86 by concealing her criminal conduct and its consequences\u2014being fired\nfrom her job.  She signed her name and certified that her statements on her OF 306 and SF-86 were\n\u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of [her] knowledge and belief and. . . made in good faith.\u201d  She\nthen concealed her criminal conduct from an authorized investigator in a security interview.  These\nactions cast serious doubts on her security worthiness.\nBecause the federal government has a compelling interest in protecting classified information,\nit must be able to place a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals granted access to classified\ninformation.  An applicant who deliberately tries to deceive or mislead the federal government does\nnot demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability and trustworthiness required of those granted\naccess to classified information\n\n9\nIn ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec. 27, 1999), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board states that an\nadministrative judge, in deciding an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, \u201cmust consider the record as a\nwhole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.\u201d  I have considered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant\u2019s\nconduct under the whole person concept of the Directive.  I conclude that Applicant has neither\nrebutted nor mitigated the security concerns raised by the allegations in the SOR, and she has not\ndemonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.: Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.: Guideline J.:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance\nis denied.\nJoan Caton Anthony\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous unresolved debts.  He found that Applicant\nstated \u201cno\u201d on his SCA when asked if he had debts that had been delinquent for 90 and 180 days\nrespectively and that these answers were not true.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has had a history of financial difficulties and significant overdue debts. He has\nreduced or eliminated by dispute many of these debts, but his overall current debt is still extremely\nhigh. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s credibility is suspect since he knew information that he provided to\nthe Government was materially incorrect and incomplete.  Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance\nis denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 28, 2007 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, dated May 1 2007, Applicant responded in writing to the\nSOR allegations. He requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.\nOn September 19, 2007, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a\nhearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on October 4,\n2007, and the hearing was held on October 17, 2007, in San Jose, California.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Government\u2019s\nExhibits 1 through 8), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 10 documentary exhibits,\n(Applicant\u2019s  Exhibits A through J) and offered his own testimony. Since Applicant did not have\ncopies of any of the documents that he offered, he was instructed to make two copies of each\ndocument, one for Department Counsel and one for the Administrative Judge. The record was held\nopen until November 2, 2007, to allow Applicant to submit copies of these documents and any\nadditional post hearing exhibits to help establish the status of debts that Applicant contended at the\nhearing were resolved. Applicant failed to meet the November 2  deadline, and the decision was\nnd\noriginally written with the assumption that no submissions would be forthcoming. However,\nApplicant did finally submit additional documents; the date on the envelope was November 7, 2007,\nand the documents were received in my office on November 9, 2007.   While this is clearly beyond\nthe time constraint allowed for additional evidence, I have considered the additional documentation\nin an effort to have a full and complete administrative record upon which to base the decision. Not\nall of the documents, previously identified as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through J, were resubmitted.\nTherefore, the new documents offered into evidence, which do include some of the previous\ndocuments,  have been identified and entered into evidence as  Exhibit A.  The transcript (Tr) was\nreceived on October 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. The\nSOR contains 22 allegations, 1.a. through 1.v., under Guideline F, and five allegation, 2.a. through\n2.e., under Guideline E. In his Response to the SOR (RSOR) Applicant admitted the following SOR\nallegations under paragraph 1: a., c., e., o., s., and v., and under paragraph 2: a., b., c., and d.  The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as  findings of fact. \n\n3\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 41 years old. He is currently unmarried, and he has one daughter. Applicant has\na Bachelor of Science degree. He is employed as a program manager operations engineer for a\ndefense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the\ndefense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists 21 debts that Applicant owed as of the time the SOR was issued, 1.a. through\n1.u. and one additional allegation 1.v., under Adjudicative Guideline F.  The allegations will be\ndiscussed in the order that they were listed in the SOR: \nWhen Applicant began testifying at the hearing, it became evident that he did not know the\nstatus of each of the debts listed on the SOR. Therefore, the record was held open to allow Applicant\nto opportunity to gather all of his records and submit to me a definitive response as to the status of\neach of these debts, and if he had evidence to establish the status of each debt, he was also to submit\nit into evidence (Tr at 41\u201351). \n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $112. In his RSOR\nApplicant admitted that this debt is due and owing. In his post hearing submission, (Exhibit A)\nApplicant argued that this debt has been disputed and it is due to be removed from his credit reports.\nThe credit reports submitted with Exhibit A acknowledge the dispute, but do not indicate that the\ndebt will be removed from the reports. I can not find that this debt has been resolved. \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $306. In his RSOR\nApplicant denied this allegation. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt has been disputed and\nremoved from his credit reports. Exhibit 5, a credit report offered by the Government, indicates this\ndebt originally arose in 1997. This debt was not listed on the latest credit report offered by Applicant,\ndated August 27, 2007. However, since there is no information to indicate that this debt was no\nlonger listed because it has been resolved in some manner, and since debts are often dropped from\ncredit reports after seven year, this debt being older than that, I cannot determine that this debt has\nbeen satisfied.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $201. In his RSOR\nApplicant admitted that this debt is due and owing. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt has\nbeen disputed and removed from his credit reports. The  August 27, 2007 credit report offered by\nApplicant, indicates that this debt  was deleted from the credit report. Therefore, I find that this debt\nhas been resolved. \n\n4\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $121. In his RSOR\nApplicant denied this allegation.  In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt has is not listed by\nany of the credit reporting services. The August 27, 2007 credit report offered by Applicant, indicates\nthat this disputed debt  was deleted from the credit report. Therefore, I find that this debt has been\nresolved. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $201. In his RSOR\nApplicant admitted that this debt is due and owing. I find that this debt, which is listed on the SOR,\nas the same creditor and the same amount as the debt listed as 1.c., above,  is a duplication of that\ndebt. Therefore, I find that this debt has been resolved. \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $2,817. In his\nRSOR Applicant denied this allegation because of a dispute. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this\ndebt, \u201cShould not be includeed (sic) in assessement (sic) beyond threahold (sic).\u201d Since I can not\ndetermine what this means, I cannot find that this debt has been satisfied.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $4,047. In his\nRSOR Applicant denied this allegation because of a dispute. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this\ndebt is in \u201cformal dispute process\u201d and it will be resolved when the original creditor retrieves the\nrecord of the debt. Since there is no evidence that the debt will be resolved, I  cannot find that this\ndebt has been satisfied.\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $1,048. In his\nRSOR Applicant denied this allegation. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt is resolved and\nhas been deleted from the August 27, 2007 credit report. The credit report acknowledges that a\ndifferent debt to this creditor is in dispute, but gives no indication that this debt is in dispute and will\nbe removed from the report. I can not find that this debt has been resolved.\n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $367. In his RSOR\nApplicant denied this allegation.  In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt is \u201cResolving for\nsettlement.\u201d I cannot find that at this time this debt has been resolved.\n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $487. In his RSOR\nApplicant denied this allegation. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt has been verified by\nEquifax reporting agency as not belonging to Applicant. I find this to be correct.  Therefore, I find\nthat this debt has been resolved. \n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $920. In his\nRSOR Applicant denied this allegation. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt is resolved and\nhas been deleted from the August 27, 2007 credit report. The TransUnion credit reporting agency\nidentified that this disputed debt would be deleted.  Therefore, I find that this debt has been resolved.\n1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $3,392. In his\nRSOR Applicant denied this allegation. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt has been\ndeleted from the August 27, 2007 credit report.  The TransUnion credit reporting agency identified\nthat this disputed debt would be deleted.  Therefore, I find that this debt has been resolved. \n\n5\n1.m. This overdue debt to Creditor 13 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $26,163 for a\njudgement entered against Applicant on January 2001. At the hearing, Applicant testified that the\ncreditor was going to make some kind of deal to resolve this debt by placing a lien on another piece\nof property that Applicant planned to sell. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that he is in negotiations\nwith the corporate attorney for this creditor, and that there is a lien on property, which is pending a\nsale and resolution.  However, no evidence has been offered to establish that, at this time, this debt\nhas been resolved.\n1.n. This overdue debt to Creditor 14 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $920. In his\nRSOR Applicant denied this allegation. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt has been\nverified as not his debt and deleted from the August 27, 2007 credit report. While this debt was not\nlisted on the August 27, 2007 credit report,  no information was included in the report to indicate that\nthis debt was no longer listed because it has been resolved in some manner. Since this debt arose in\nNovember 2000, it could have been dropped from credit report without any resolution. Therefore,\nI cannot determine that this debt has been satisfied.\n1.o. This overdue debt to Creditor 15 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $201. In his\nRSOR Applicant admitted that this debt is due and owing. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this\ndebt has been deleted from the August 27, 2007 credit report. The TransUnion credit reporting\nagency identified that this disputed debt would be deleted.  Therefore, I find that this debt has been\nresolved. \n1.p. This overdue debt to Creditor 16 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $1,771. In his\nRSOR Applicant denied this allegation. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt has been\nresolved and deleted from the October 12, 2007 credit report (Exhibit 8).  While this debt was not\nlisted on Exhibit 8,  no information was included in the report to indicate that this debt was no longer\nlisted because it has been resolved in some manner. Since this debt arose in August 2000, it could\nhave been dropped from credit report without any resolution. Therefore, I cannot determine that this\ndebt has been satisfied.\n1.q. This overdue debt to Creditor 17 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $54. In his RSOR\nApplicant denied this allegation. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt has been resolved and\ndeleted from the October 12, 2007 credit report (Exhibit 8).  While this debt was not listed on\nExhibit 8,  no information was included in the report to indicate that this debt was no longer listed\nbecause it has been resolved in some manner. Since this debt arose in April 2000, it could have been\ndropped from credit report without any resolution. Therefore, I cannot determine that this debt has\nbeen satisfied.\n1.r. This overdue debt to Creditor 18 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $23,036.  In his\nRSOR Applicant denied this allegation because of a dispute. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this\ndebt is the same as that listed on 1.m., above. While both of these debts are greater than $20,000, I\ncan not see evidence that they are the same debt, although they may be.  Additional evidence would\nbe required to establish that this is the same debt as 1.m.\n\n6\n1.s. This overdue debt to Creditor 19 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $365. In his RSOR\nApplicant admitted that this debt is due and owing. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt is\n\u201cResolving for settlement.\u201d I cannot find that at this time this debt has been resolved.\n1.t. This overdue debt to Creditor 20 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $289. In his RSOR\nApplicant denied this allegation. In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt was identified in the\nAugust 27, 2007 credit report as \u201cpaying as agreed\u201d as of May 2004. I cannot find that at this time\nthis debt is overdue.\n1.u. This overdue debt to Creditor 21 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $159. In his\nRSOR Applicant denied this allegation.  In Exhibit A, Applicant argued that this debt has been\nresolved and deleted from the October 12, 2007 credit report (Exhibit 8).  While this debt was not\nlisted on Exhibit 8,  no information was included in the report to indicate that this debt was no longer\nlisted because it has been resolved in some manner. Since this debt arose in August 1999, it could\nhave been dropped from credit report without any resolution. Therefore, I cannot determine that this\ndebt has been satisfied.\n1.v. Applicant prepared a Personal Financial Statement on December 18, 2007, (Exhibit 6)\nwhich indicates he has a monthly net remainder of $2,800, after expenses. The Government alleges\nthat he should have been able to resolve more of his debts.  In his RSOR Applicant admitted this\nallegation, but he added that he needed to seek legal assistance for some of these debts.  In Exhibit\nA, Applicant argued that he has been \u201cproactively  taking continuous mitigating steps\u201d to resolve his\ndebts. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n2.a. Applicant completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA) on\nSeptember 13, 2004. Question #38 asks,  \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d to this question and listed no debts (Exhibit\n1). Clearly, at the time he completed the SCA, Applicant was or had been over 180 days delinquent\non  the debts listed on the SOR, and he should have included these debts. In his RSOR Applicant\nadmitted this allegation.\n2.b. Question #39 asks,  \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nApplicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d to this question and again listed no debts (Exhibit 1). At the time he\ncompleted the SCA, Applicant was still delinquent on the debts listed on the SOR, and he should\nhave included all of these debts. In his RSOR Applicant admitted this allegation.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his responses to Questions #38 and #39 was that since he was\ndisputing or paying some of these debts, he did not want to list them on the SCA as legitimate. He\ncould give no reasonable explanation for why he did not list those debts that he was not disputing,\nor  why he could not give information about the debts on which he claimed to be making payments.\n2.c. Applicant was arrested on January 1, 1997, and charged with (1) Fraud, Use of Credit\nCard over $100, (2) uttering Forged Instrument, (3) Grand Theft-Attempt 3   Degree, and (4)\nrd\nForgery. On January 23, 1997, Applicant was charged with one count on Grand Theft-Attempt 3rd\n\n7\nDegree, a felony, to which Applicant plead Not Guilty.  On January 27, 1997, the judge in the case\nwithheld adjudication and Applicant was placed on a pretrial diversion program. The case was Nolle\nProssed on April 7, 1998. In his RSOR Applicant admitted this allegation.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation at the hearing of this event was that his girlfriend, at the time, gave\nhim a credit card to use to purchase several items. Applicant used the card for several purchases and\nsigned his name each time, even though, according to Applicant, not only was this credit card not\nhis, but it belonged to someone other than his female companion.  He contended that he was not\naware that the card did not belong to his girlfriend, but he could give no reasonable explanation for\nwhy he would sign his name for a card that he believed belonged to his girlfriend, who was with him\nwhen the purchases were  made. \n2.d. Question #21 of the SCA asks, \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any\nfelony offense?\u201d Applicant  was  instructed to \u201creport information regardless of whether the record\nin your case was sealed or otherwise stricken from the record.\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d to this\nquestion and failed to list the 1997 felony charge as set forth in paragraph 2.c., above. In his RSOR\nApplicant admitted this allegation.\n2.e. During a June 15, 2005 interview with an authorized investigator for the Department of\nDefense Applicant did not fully disclose the events as described in paragraph 2.c., above. He failed\nto disclose the full extent of his misuse use of the credit card on four separate occasions. In his\nRSOR Applicant denied this allegation contending that he omitted this information because he was\nfound Not Guilty.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully\nconsidered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense\ndetermination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or\nmitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.\nAlthough the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not\ndeterminative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of\nseriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.\n\n8\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of\nknowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). \nBURDEN OF PROOF\n              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish\nhis security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\ndemonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's\nfitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration\nof such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of\nrecurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has\na heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted\nby the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988),\n\"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with regarding Guidelines F and E: \n(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nWith respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that Applicant has had a history\nof financial difficulties and many long overdue debts. The evidence shows that Applicant has made\nan effort  to resolve these debts through payment or dispute. However, at this time there are still a\ngreat many long overdue debts that do not appear to be resolved.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both  DC 19.\n(a) and (c) apply because of Applicant\u2019s history of unwillingness to satisfy his debts, and his history\nof not meeting financial obligations. While Mitigating Condition (MC) 20. (d)  is applicable to\nApplicant under Guideline F, because he has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, it is\nnot controlling because of the long history of overdue bills and the current significant unresolved\ndebts. I, therefore,  resolve Guideline F against Applicant.\n\n9\n(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided inaccurate\ninformation to the Government in response to questions, #38,  39, and 21 on the SCA that he\nexecuted in September 13, 2004.  I conclude that when Applicant completed the SCA, he knowingly\nand wilfully provided false and materiel information to the Government. He also was not truthful\nwith the information that he provided to the Government  investigator.\nIn reviewing the DCs  under Guideline E, I conclude that DC 16. (a) applies because of\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate omission, concealment, and falsification of relevant facts from a personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, which was used to determine security clearance eligibility. DC 16. (b) also\napplies because Applicant deliberately provided false information to an investigator. I can not find\nthat any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies in this paragraph.  I resolve Guideline E against\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the  Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations,  Guideline F: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u.: Against Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct,  Guideline E: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.: Against Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances and facts presented by the record in this case, it is clearly not\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

While attending college from 1995 to 1999 he accumulated numerous\ncredit card debts. He only recently set up repayment plans on two of the debts. He intentionally failed\nto list his credit card debts and his prior drug use on three security documents, violations of federal\nlaw. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 13, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when\nthe SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on December 6, 2006, and admitted\nall of the allegations. He elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to another judge on February 7, 2006, and due to a medical emergency was reassigned to\nme on March 5, 2007. With the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing on March 7, 2007, to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. The Government offered three exhibits that were marked as GE 1-3 and\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his behalf and offered six exhibits that were\nmarked as AE A-F and were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.)\non March 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 30 years old and has worked as an administrative assistant for a federal\ncontractor since April 2005.

The jobs he had were not good paying jobs and he\nstated he did not focus on his credit card debt with any sense of urgency.  Applicant made a payment\n1\nof $236.66 on January 8, 2007, for the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  He also set up an automatic\n2\nrepayment plan to have that same amount deducted monthly from his bank account until the debt is\npaid in full.  On January 23, 2007 and February 23, 2007, Applicant made two $100 payments\n3\ntoward the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.e.  He intends to continue making monthly payments toward this\n4\ndebt and has set up an automatic deduction from his bank account to pay it.  Applicant intends on\n5\nrepaying these two debts and then start making payments toward the other debts.\nApplicant\u2019s wife pays the mortgage on their condominium (condo) and he pays the monthly\ncondo fee of $352. After paying his monthly expenses he estimated he had approximately $600\nremaining. Applicant and his wife bought a timeshare in November 2006 for approximately\n$20,000.  He pays $127 a month as his share for that expense. They also bought pots and pans in the\n6\nsummer of 2006 for $2,000.  He estimates they make a $100 monthly payment. Applicant stated he\n7\nmade impulse purchases. He and his wife have a joint credit card that they owe approximately\n$1,536.  Applicant contributes to their joint saving and they have approximately $3,500 in their\n8\naccount.  He does not use that money to repay his debts. His wife is not assisting him in repaying\n9\nhis delinquent debts. He did not have an explanation for why it took so long for him to address his\ndelinquent debts. Applicant has not had any financial counseling, but does maintain a spreadsheet\nbudget to keep track of his money.  \n10\nApplicant executed a Questionnaire For Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) on September 7,\n2004. He answered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking if he had any debts over 180 days delinquent. That\nanswer was false because Applicant was aware of his overdue credit card debts. On the same date,\nhe executed a Supplemental Questionnaire for Selected Positions. He answered \u201cno\u201d to a question\non that form that asked if he had used illegal drugs in the past 7 years or since he was 16, whichever\nwas a shorter period. That answer was false because Applicant had used marijuana from 2000 to\n2003. On November 2, 2005, Applicant certified on an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-Qip) document, in response to an inquiry about his past drug use, that he had not used\nany illegal drugs in the past 7 years or since he was 16 whichever was shorter. That answer was false\n\nTr. 54.\n11\nTr.56.\n12\nTr. 56.\n13\nTr. 55.\n14\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n15\nId. at 527.\n16\nExec.

On that same document, Applicant certified\nhe did not have any delinquent debts over 180 days and he did not have any delinquent debts that\nwere currently overdue or over 90 days overdue. Both responses were false. \nApplicant admitted he intentionally and deliberately falsified the answers to the questions\nin the referenced documents.  He stated he falsified the documents because he was afraid he would\n11\nnot get the job if he told the truth. He stated his former jobs were not going anywhere and he just\nwanted to get this job so he could work at a better paying job.  He stated \u201cI guess I tried to give\n12\nmyself a leg up.\u201d  He did not view this as a \u201cnational security\u201d issue, but more as a personal issue.\n13\n14\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate and intentional falsifications are felony violations under Title 18 U.S.C \u00a7\n1001.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n15\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n16\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n17\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should\n18\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\n19\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n20\n\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n21\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n22\n5\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n21\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.22\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nAdditionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with\nthe factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct\nand surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the\napplicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent,\nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence\nof rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the revised adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuideline F-Financial Considerations are a concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because criminal activity creates doubt\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n\n6\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered the facts in evidence and legal standards. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19 (a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19 (c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant acquired delinquent credit card debts while he was in\ncollege and has failed to repay them. He admits he owes the debts and has not made payments on\nthe debts until recently when he started payment plans on two of the accounts. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20 (b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20 (c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20 (d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant had no explanation for why it has taken him years to begin to address his\ndelinquent debts. He made two payments on two debts shortly before his hearing and set up payment\nplans on those debts. All of the debts are recent because they have not been satisfied. He has\nnumerous debts so his behavior leading to the debts was frequent. I find the debts are recent and\nfrequent. Therefore FC MC 20 (a) cannot be applied. Applicant did not present any evidence that his\nfinancial situation was due to conditions beyond his control. To the contrary, he stated he was a\nyoung college student who used his credit cards without regard to his obligations to repay them. He\nlet them remain dormant for years, despite being employed. He did not have an explanation for why\nhe did not start repaying them sooner. I cannot apply FC MC 20 (b) because the conditions that\nresulted in his financial problems were within his control and he chose to ignore them for a long\nperiod. Applicant only recently started to repay two debts. Although this is a good sign, he also\ncontinued to make frivolous expenditures without regard for his delinquent debts. He and his wife\nspent $20,000 on a timeshare and purchased pots and pans for $2,000, both luxury items. Instead of\nusing the money to buy down his debt he spent money with little regard for his legal financial\nobligations. Despite his nominal effort in making a couple of payments on his debts, I cannot find\nhe has exercised a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. He also has not received financial\ncounseling to assist him in resolving his debts. Therefore, I find FC MC (c) and (d) do not apply.\nBased on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16 (a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.) applies. Applicant intentionally failed to list\n\nISCR Case No. 01-06870, 2002 WL 32114535 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2002). \n23\n7\nhis drug use and his delinquent debts on three official documents. His explanations for providing\nfalse information was because he wanted to increase his chances of receiving the job. Information\nis material if it would affect a final agency decision or, if incorrect, would impede a thorough and\ncomplete investigation of an applicant\u2019s background.  An applicant\u2019s financial history and drug\n23\nbackground are matters that could affect a final agency decision on whether to grant the applicant\na clearance, and an applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the information would impede a thorough\ninvestigation of his background. At the time he completed the official documents, Applicant was\naware of his delinquent debts and drug background, yet he deliberately failed to list this information\non the documents. Hence, the above disqualifying condition applies.\nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC ) and especially\nconsidered PC MC 17 (a) (the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) and PC MC 17 (e) (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation\nor duress). I find neither applies. There is no evidence to support any effort by Applicant to correct\nthe falsifications before being confronted with the facts or that he has taken any steps to reduce his\nvulnerability. Applicant\u2019s answers on his applications regarding his debts were deliberate\nfalsifications with the intent to mislead. Applicant made false statements on September 7, 2004. He\ndid not come forward to correct the false statements. To the contrary, when he had another\nopportunity to make an official statement on November 2, 2005, he again repeated the false\nstatement, thereby perpetuating the original falsification. Applicant was afraid he would not get the\njob, so he lied about his background. Applicant has not provided any information of positive steps\nhe has taken to reduce his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. He seemed to believe\nthat because the lie had to do with his personal conduct that it would therefore not affect his ability\nto protect national security. His beliefs are misguided and his judgment is questionable. I find PC\nMC 17 (a) and (e) do not apply.\nBased on all the evidence, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31(a) (a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and 31 (b) (allegations or admissions of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted),\napply. Applicant intentionally and deliberately lied on his SF85P, Supplemental Questionnaire for\nSelected Positions dated September 7, 2005, and his eQip document dated November 2, 2005, felony\nviolations under Title 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1001.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) 32 (a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and CC MC 32 (d)\n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement). Applicant\u2019s falsification of\nofficial documents occurred on two separate dates over a year apart. He had an opportunity to reflect\non his falsifications and come forward to correct them, but he did not, rather he repeated them. His\nactions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. He does not seem to grasp\n\n8\nthe gravity of his falsifications and reflected an attitude that because the lies had to do with his\nbackground information that this should not be a concern about his ability to protect classified\ninformation. I find there is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation. Therefore, I find CC\nMC 32 (a) and (d) do not apply. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. I considered that Applicant has recently started\nrepayment plans on two of his debts and set up automatic deductions to repay two of his debts. I\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s age when he first incurred the credit card debts and his maturity level as a\ncollege student in understanding the ramifications of owning and using credit cards. I also considered\nthe length of time it took Applicant to begin repaying his debts. I considered the reasons Applicant\nstated for providing false statements on the official documents he was required to complete and that\nhe repeated his falsifications on a subsequent document. After considering all of the evidence, I find\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). Therefore, I am persuaded by\nthe totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guidelines F, E and J are decided against\nApplicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJoseph C. Rullo, Sr., Personal Representative\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant, an electrician employed by a defense contractor, mitigated financial security\nconcerns arising from bankruptcy filed in 1996 and, after two re-filings, discharged in 2004, a state\ntax lien paid in 2005, and a medical bill paid in 2006. Also mitigated were personal conduct\nallegations relating to his failure to report the three financial matters on his security clearance\napplication (SF 86) in 2004. He regarded the bankruptcy as over seven years old and outside the\nreporting requirement. He did not know of the other two debts until after the SF 86 filing. Clearance\nin granted.  \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, and\nsubject to the revised Adjudicative Guidelines effective September 1, 2006, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nOn December 12, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe matter was assigned to me on February 12, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March 2,\n2007, for a hearing on March 22, 2007, and held that day. The government offered 15 exhibits.\nApplicant offered none into evidence at the hearing but provided five in a post hearing submission\non May 23, 2007. All of the offered exhibits were admitted in evidence. The transcript was received\non April 3, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted three SOR allegations relating to bankruptcy and denied the two relating\nto a debt and a lien with explanation. He denied allegations relating to omissions on his SF 86 with\nexplanation. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as an electrician doing\ncable installation since his employment in 2003. In the mid-1990's he had financial difficulties\nstemming from mismanagement of his family finances. His wife was the financial manager for the\nfamily. The debts were for a home mortgage, credit cards and medical expenses. After they\nseparated, he discovered extensive diversions by his wife from their account to her parents who had\nfinancial problems stemming from a failed business of her father. \nIn March 1996 Applicant and his wife filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy in the midst of a\ndivorce. In December 1997, as a result of confusion as to who was to make the payments on the\nbankruptcy, some payments were missed and it was dismissed. It was re-filed in February 1998 and\n\n3\ndismissed in July 1998 for non-compliance. It was again re-filed in August 1998 and, after a\ndismissal, reconsideration, and  re-opening, was discharged on January, 6, 2004 (Exhs. 9-14).\nApplicant and his wife were divorced in 2004. \nThe three filings were alleged in the SOR as separate bankruptcies. While each of these three\nfilings used different file numbers, the amounts involved in all were approximately the same with\nassets and liabilities of between $77,000 and $79,000. Applicant was represented throughout the\nbankruptcy proceedings by two different lawyers but both were with the same law firm. He followed\ntheir advice and did what they advised him to do. Although he knew he had been to court a number\nof times and signed several papers, he believed all the documents related to only a single bankruptcy\n(Tr. 32-35). \nIn addition to bankruptcy, two other debts were alleged in the SOR. Applicant had a\ndelinquent medical bill of $103 which was paid in December 11, 2006 (Exh. A 1), the same day he\nlearned about it when he was shown a credit report for this proceeding. The debt was for pediatric\nservices for one of his children. Although his wife was responsible for paying those bills for the\nchildren with health insurance, he paid the bill and did not question it. \nApplicant also had a state tax lien of $1,439 filed in 2004 which was paid and released on\nAugust 5, 2005 (Exh. 15). He was unaware of it until the spring of 2005 since he was working\noverseas and the notice of the lien was not sent to him. The government stipulated at the hearing that\nit had been paid. Originally it was an underpayment of approximately $100 that grew exponentially\nfrom interest and late charges. \nApplicant filed his first security clearance application (SF 86) in January 2000 and listed the\n1998 bankruptcy in response to Question 33 and one financial delinquency not now at issue for\ndelinquent debts of both 180 and 90 days in response to Questions 38 and 39 (Exh. 2). The\napplication was withdrawn when his job prospect did not materialize. When he filed a second SF 86\nin September 2004 for his current employer, he did not list the bankruptcy at Question 33, the tax\nlien at Question 36, and the medical bill as a delinquent debt of over 180 days at Question 38 (Exh.\n1). When he completed the SF 86 he viewed the bankruptcy from its inception from the first filing\nin 1996. Thus, it was then over seven years old and beyond the reach of the question which called\nfor bankruptcies within the past seven years. He did not know about the tax lien until 2005 or the\nmedical bill until 2006. The omission of the bankruptcy information was done in good faith based\non a reasonable interpretation, and the other two alleged omissions concerned information about\nwhich he then was unaware. He had no intent to deceive (Tr. 58). \nApplicant served three years in the Navy. He trained as a fire control officer but had difficulty\nwith the math and served most of his tour as a boatswain. He has a high school education and some\ntechnical instruction in his field. \nApplicant\u2019s job takes him overseas for various assignments aboard Navy ships, and he has\nhad a number of such tours in the past years. Because of his work assignments he has no permanent\nresidence other than living with his parents between assignments. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly take-home pay after deductions is $2,400 (Tr. 110 and Exh. A 3). He\n\n4\nis paid $18 an hour for his work. When he is overseas he receives $60 a day per diem allowance. He\nalso receives $106 per month for 10% veteran\u2019s disability (Tr. 127). He has received tax refunds of\n$3,700 for 2005 and $618 for 2006 (Exh A 4 and 5). He has two teenage children living with his\nformer wife and pays child support of $595 per month plus a $40 per month allowance for the\nyounger child. He recently purchased an automobile for one of his children. He has no credit cards\nand has only one more payment left to make on his own car. The child support and auto loan are his\nonly debts. He has two bank accounts each with a balance of approximately $1,000. He also has two\n401(k) accounts with his employer totaling over $30,000 in assets (Tr. 111). \nApplicant recently re-married and his wife travels with him on his overseas assignments\nwhen she is permitted to do so depending on the assignment. He believes she will soon be employed\nand contribute to their income.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) and E2.2. factors in the\nDirective, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s one delinquent debt, a tax lien, and bankruptcy prompted the allegation of\nsecurity concern under Guideline F of the adjudicative guidelines (AG) since an individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c) and evidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\n(AG \u00b6 19 a) Mitigating Conditions (MC) that might apply include the fact that the behavior happened\nso long ago or under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability , trustworthiness, or good judgment (AG \u00b6 20 a), or the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control as a result of divorce or separation\n(AG \u00b6 20 b), or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control (AG\n\u00b6 20 c), or the person has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts (AG \u00b6 20 d). \nWhile it may be technically correct that Applicant filed three bankruptcies as alleged, the fact\nthat they all stemmed from the same debts and he was relying on advice of counsel in all the steps\nhe took, leads me to conclude that for practical purposes there was only one and that he should not\nbe held responsible for three. He has a high school education and was not skilled in the world of\nbankruptcy, so he relied on his counsel during the entire course of the bankruptcy proceeding. In any\nevent, whether one or three, the matter was successfully resolved in 2004, more than three years ago\nand his financial situation since that time has significantly improved. The factors leading to the\nfinancial problems in the 1990's are no longer extant. The alleged delinquent medical bill was small\nand unknown to him until 2006. He paid it the same day he learned of it. The tax deficiency was\nsmall in the beginning and grew as a result of Applicant\u2019s not knowing of it because of his\nemployment at many difference locations with no fixed address after his divorce. It was paid in 2005.\nAll mitigating conditions are applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his financial delinquencies, tax lien, and bankruptcy at Questions\n33, 36 and 38 on his SF 86 raises issues under Guideline E that might indicate questionable\njudgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information (AG \u00b6 15). Specifically, the\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel\nsecurity application could raise a security concern and be disqualifying. (AG \u00b6 16 a) The bankruptcy\nwas reported on his 2000 SF 86 but was not on his 2004 SF 86. He considered the bankruptcy filing\nas the first in 1996, which was more than seven years before his September 2004 filing and thus\nbeyond the requirement to report. He did not list the tax lien because he did not know about it until\n2005. The medical bill was not known by him until 2006 so he could not report either in 2004. Thus,\nI conclude that the bankruptcy omission was not deliberate as required by the guideline and the\ninformation on the other two allegations was not available to him at the time he filed the SF 86. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant\n\n6\nimpressed me at the hearing as a credible, hard-working person whose debts compared to his assets\nhad accumulated to the point that he filed for bankruptcy with his former wife. Their divorce\ncomplicated his problems. He is sufficiently chagrined by the financial problems he has had  that it\nis unlikely to recur. He has taken significant corrective steps and established to my satisfaction that\nhe is financially responsible and did not intend to deliberately withhold information on his SF 86.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that a security clearance should be granted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant had filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on May 20, 2003; that the petition was converted to a Chapter 7 filing on January 7, 2005; and that the Chapter 7 case was dismissed on February 7, 2005. The government further alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.n that, between February 2002 and June 2005, he owed about $30,000 in delinquent accounts that have been charged off as business losses, referred to collection agencies, or enforced through judgments and garnishments. Applicant denied these allegations, but also asserted that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c have been paid by wage garnishments.

You did not make payments on that second mortgage for approximately two years. Your second mortgage was foreclosed on in August 2007. Applicant admitted the allegation.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nOn May 26, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86)\nto request a security clearance for his employment with a defense contractor. After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\n1\nApplicant\u2019s request. On August 28, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations) and\n2\nGuideline E (personal conduct).\nFebruary 12, 2008\n\n Authorized by the Directive, at E3.1.17.\n3\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on November 13, 2007, and I scheduled a hearing to be held on\nDecember 11, 2007. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented\nseven exhibits (Gx. 1 - 7). Applicant testified in his own behalf. DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) on December 19, 2007. I left the record open until December 21, 2007,\nto allow Applicant to make a post-hearing submission (Tr., 96 - 97); however, nothing\nfurther was submitted. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant had filed\nfor Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on May 20, 2003; that the petition was converted\nto a Chapter 7 filing on January 7, 2005; and that the Chapter 7 case was dismissed on\nFebruary 7, 2005. The government further alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.n that,\nbetween February 2002 and June 2005, he owed about $30,000 in delinquent accounts\nthat have been charged off as business losses, referred to collection agencies, or\nenforced through judgments and garnishments. Applicant denied these allegations, but\nalso asserted that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c have been paid by wage\ngarnishments.\nDuring cross-examination of the Applicant, Department Counsel moved to amend\nthe SOR to conform to the information produced at hearing.  Applicant did not object\n3\nand I granted the motion. (Tr., 52 - 54, 79 - 80) Accordingly, I amended the SOR to add\na new allegation as SOR \u00b6 1.o the following:\nYou are indebted to Greentree/Eastrock Financial in the approximate\namount of $38,614 for a second home mortgage. You did not make\npayments on that second mortgage for approximately two years. Your\nsecond mortgage was foreclosed on in August 2007.\nApplicant admitted the allegation. (Tr., 80)\nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant\ndeliberately falsified his response to DOHA interrogatories in November 2006 by\nasserting his Chapter 7 bankruptcy was discharged, and by providing a document in\nsupport of his response, when he knew the case had, in fact, been dismissed. In SOR\n2.b, the government alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his response to a second set\nof DOHA interrogatories in February 2007 when he again asserted his bankruptcy had\nbeen discharged, and again provided a document in support of his response. Applicant\ndenied both allegations, asserting he thought \u201cdischarged\u201d and \u201cdismissed\u201d meant the\nsame thing in bankruptcy. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\n\n The order stated that it applied to Applicant only.\n4\n3\nApplicant is 42 years old and, since April 2004, has worked for a defense\ncontractor as a senior designer. He generates, modifies, and maintains shipboard\nsystems drawings and blueprints using computer-aided drawing (CAD) at a shipyard.\nHe also served in the U.S. Navy Reserve from 1984 until 1995, achieving the rank of\npetty officer second class (paygrade E-5). Applicant has held a security clearance either\nthrough his civilian work or through his military service since about 1984.\nApplicant has been married since 1997, and has two children, ages 14 and 12. A\nprevious marriage ended in divorce in 1997 after ten years. He has two children from\nthat marriage, ages 19 and 16, for whom he was ordered to pay monthly support as a\nterm of the divorce decree. At one point, his pay was garnished to satisfy a $1,192\narrearage. That debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was satisfied by 1999, before Applicant was able to\nbuy a house. He has not been behind on his child support payments since 1999.\nApplicant and his wife began experiencing financial problems in 2002, when they\nwere both unemployed between May and September of that year. Since then there\nhave been no periods of unemployment. Nonetheless, they accrued several delinquent\ndebts totaling about $30,000. \nIn July 2005, Applicant failed to pay $507 on a jewelry store account, the original\nbalance of which was about $800. The debt was enforced through a civil judgment\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) and satisfied in October or November 2005. (Tr., 85 - 86; Gx. 2) The\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e - 1.I represent $432 in unpaid medical bills incurred for his\nwife\u2019s periodic emergency room visits for a heart condition. Applicant claimed he and his\nwife have challenged these debts, but provided no supporting documentation. (Tr. 80 -\n82)\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Applicant accrued three delinquent credit card\naccounts totaling about $2,550 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.j, and 1.k). He also owes about $25,370\nas a result of two car repossessions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m), and another $766 for an\nunpaid early termination fee from a home security service (SOR \u00b6 1.n).\nIn May 2003, Applicant and his wife, as joint debtors, filed for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy protection. In November 2004, the Chapter 13 trustee moved to dismiss\ntheir Chapter 13 bankruptcy for failure to make payments. In January 2005, their petition\nwas converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy. On February 7, 2005, Applicant\u2019s\nrole in the joint bankruptcy petition was ended by an Order of Dismissal for Failure to\nAttend Meeting of Creditors.  (SOR \u00b6 1.a) On May 6, 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife received a\n4\nDischarge of One Joint Debtor. Thereafter, the case was closed. (Gx. 4; Gx. 7)\nApplicant and his wife bought a house in 1999 for $109,000. In June 2000, they\nobtained a second mortgage for about $38,000 to pay for improvements to the house.\nThey stopped making payments on their second mortgage sometime in 2005. When\ntheir first mortgage also became delinquent in 2007, the company holding the second\nmortgage bought the first mortgage and foreclosed. Applicant and his family had to\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and\n6\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n4\nmove out of their house in November 2007, and he still owes $38,614 (SOR \u00b6 1.o) for\nnon-payment of his second mortgage. (Tr., 36 - 52, 75 - 79; Gx. 5; Gx. 6)\nIn November 2006 and February 2007, Applicant responded to interrogatories\nsent to him by DOHA adjudicators. In response to questions about his finances, unpaid\ndebts, and bankruptcy status, Applicant asserted most of his debts had been\ndischarged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2005. In support of his claim of\ndischarge, Applicant provided in each notarized response to interrogatories a copy of a\nDischarge of One Joint Debtor, which contained his name as the debtor whose\nobligations were to be liquidated. However, a comparison of the docket histories\ncontained Gx. 2 and Gx. 7, a close examination of the document proffered by Applicant\nin his interrogatory responses, and acceptance of the common sense notion that it\nmakes no sense for the courts to issue a separate discharge for each joint debtor, all\nlead to one conclusion \u2013 Applicant altered the document he submitted by substituting\nhis name where his wife\u2019s had been on the authentic discharge order. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and\n2.b) Applicant insists the document is as he received it from the court. He also has\nimplied his wife, who notarized his signature on his answer to the SOR and on his\nsecond response to interrogatories, may have had something to do with how the\ndocument appears. (Tr. 93 - 96)\nAfter expenses each month, Applicant estimates he has about $1,000 left over\nfrom the $3,700 net monthly income he and his wife bring home. However, the\nexpenses he is paying do not include any payments to the debts listed in the SOR. (Tr.,\n85 - 90) \nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n6\nmitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under Guideline F (financial considerations), at AG \u00b6 18, and\nGuideline E (personal conduct) at AG \u00b6 15.\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n8\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n5\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n7\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n8\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.9\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations. \nUnder Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18) The government presented sufficient information to support\nthe allegations of a failed bankruptcy petition in 2005 (SOR 1.a), and multiple delinquent\ndebts totaling more than $30,000 (SOR 1.b - 1.n). The government also supported its\nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.o that Applicant owes more than $38,000 after his mortgage was\nforeclosed last year. While the information presented supports Applicant\u2019s contentions\nthat the debts in SOR 1.b and 1.c have been paid, available information shows\nApplicant has had significant debts since 2002, that he is unwilling to pay or resolve\nthrough other means, such as bankruptcy. Accordingly, the record requires\nconsideration of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and 19(c)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).\nBy contrast, the record does not support consideration of any of the Guideline F\nmitigating conditions listed at AG 20. His 2007 mortgage foreclosure precludes a finding\nhis financial problems are not recent, and he presented no information to show his\ndebts will not recur or do not reflect adversely on his suitability for access to classified\ninformation. (AG 21(a)) Applicant claims his financial problems stemmed from periods of\n\n See footnote 6, supra.\n10\n6\nunemployment, but those events occurred five years ago, and Applicant has not acted\nresponsibly to manage his finances. (AG 21(b)) For example, he had an opportunity to\nhave his debts discharged in bankruptcy but lost that opportunity by failing to participate\nin the process as required. Further, he has not acted in good faith to pay or otherwise\nresolve his debts (AG 21(d), and he has not sought help for his financial problems from\na credit counseling service or other appropriate entity (AG 21(c)). On balance, Applicant\nhas failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the government\u2019s information.\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in AG \u00b6\n15, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d The\ngovernment\u2019s information supports the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b allegations that Applicant\ndeliberately falsified his responses to government questions about his finances.\nApplicant deliberately and unabashedly tried to mislead and deceive the government\nwhen he claimed his debts had been discharged in bankruptcy and when he provided\naltered documents in support of his false statements. Applicant\u2019s conduct falls squarely\nwithin AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority,\nor other official government representative), and is directly contrary to the basic tenets\nof the industrial security program, which relies on the candor and integrity of persons to\nwhom access is granted. Even allowing for the possibility his wife was involved in\naltering the document, Applicant is responsible for the statements and representations\nhe makes to the government.\nI have also reviewed the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 17. The record does\nnot warrant consideration of any of them. Accordingly, Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe security concerns about his personal conduct.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines F and E. I have also\nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG\n2(a).  Applicant is 42 years old and responsible for supporting his wife and children.\n10\nApart from a brief period five years ago, he has been gainfully employed. However, the\nseriousness of his conduct cannot be overstated. Nor is there any information to\nsuggest he is rehabilitated and unlikely to engage in such falsifications in the future, as\nhe persisted in his denials of falsification at hearing. As for his finances, Applicant has\nnot shown he has any inclination to properly manage his money. Significant doubts\npersist about whether Applicant is suitable for continued access to classified\n\n See footnote 9, supra. \n11\n7\ninformation. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the national interest.  \n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant is a 50-year-old transport manager who has worked for a defense contractor since August 2004, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance. In the mid-1990\u2019s, when an air base closed, Applicant relocated to New Mexico. In July 2000, Applicant relocated from New Mexico to her current location.

Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.004(c) and 16.051 (statute of limitations for contracts); \n16.004(a)(3) (statute of limitations for debts); Cont\u2019l Casualty Co. v. Dr. Pepper Bottling Co. of Tex., 416 \nF.Supp. 2d 497, 505-507 (W.D. Tex. 2006); Facility Ins. Corp. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 357 F.3d \n508, 513-514 (5th Cir. 2004) (discussing statute of limitations for open or revolving accounts).  Debts \nbarred by the Texas statute of limitations are legally uncollectible. However, Applicant\u2019s payments on his \ndebts have reinstated them, ending the statute of limitations defense to collection. See Stine v. Stewart, \n80 S.W.3d 586, 591, 45 Tex. Sup.J. 966 (Tex. 2002).   \n \nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of \napplication of the statute of limitations: \n \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they \nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability \nto human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is \nthe laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes \nof limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, \nthey will not be ha[iled] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations \n\n \n3\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nunemployed or underemployed caring for a sick daughter prior to the time the debt was \nwritten off. Following her relocation, even though Applicant had two jobs, she was \nbarely able to pay the rent. (Tr. 27)  \n \nAt that time, her daughter had complications with her pregnancy. Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter and grandaugher\u2500now age 5\u2500lived with her, but have now moved out. She \nwas severely depressed because of family and marital distress. (Ex. 3) She was \nseparated and the sole provider for her family. Applicant and her husband separated in \n1996 (Tr. 26) and moved back together in 2005. He has no job, but is taking classes \nworking on his teaching certificate. (Tr. 62) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from October 2001 through January 2002, June 2002 \nthrough January 2003, July 2003 through January 2004, and June 2004 through August \n2004, when she obtained her current job. (Ex. B) For her first period of unemployment, \nshe received $330 every two weeks. For the other periods of unemployment, she \nreceived $260 every two weeks.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports list a second debt with the previously mentioned credit \ncard company and four additional debts from various collection agencies. In April 2006, \nshe was interviewed about her debts, at that time she stated she did not recognize the \naccounts, and would look into the debts. (Ex. 2) In December 2006, Applicant answered \nwritten interrogatories (EX 3) saying she had not done business with the listed creditors \nor the companies for whom they were attempting to collect. She sent letters to the \ncreditors (Ex 3, Attachments A\u2500E) asking them to validate the debts. In June 2007, \nApplicant answered written interrogatories (EX 2) stating she had not done business \nwith the listed creditors and sent letters to the creditors asking them to validate the \ndebts.  \n \n \nIn her August 2007 answer to the SOR, Applicant stated she does not recognize \nthe collection agencies and had written to companies to verify the debts. One company \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) sent her a computer generated statement, but no additional documents to \nvalidate the claim. Two of the companies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and 1.e) could not provide her \nwith documents validating the debt. The fourth company (SOR \u00b6 1.e) failed to respond \nto her inquiry. (Tr. 53) \n \n \nperiods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights. Statutes of limitations are, indeed, \nfundamental to our judicial system. \n  \n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The reduction in the magnitude and number of debts that \ncreditors can legally enforce because of the application of the Texas statute of limitations reduces the \npotential vulnerability to improper financial inducements, and the degree that a debtor is \u201cfinancially \noverextended,\u201d is also reduced. However, it does not negate the debtor\u2019s past conduct, which failed to \ntake more aggressive actions to resolve the financial jeopardy.  \n \n\n \n4\n \nIn November 2004, Applicant completed a security clearance application, \nStandard Form (SF) 86. Question 38 asked if she had been 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt in the prior seven years. She answered \u201cno.\u201d She also answered \u201cno\u201d to question \n39, which asked if she was currently 90 days delinquent on any debt. At the time she \ncompleted the SF 86, she was not receiving calls from creditors, although she is \ncurrently getting calls from the collection agency listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr.36) At the time \nshe completed her SF 86, she did not remember the debts. (Tr. 72)  \n \nThe delinquent account in SOR \u00b6 1.a was charged off in November 2000, the \ndelinquent account in SOR \u00b6 1.b was charged off in April 2001, the delinquent account \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c was referred to a collection agency for a VISA account in October 2001, \nthe delinquent account in SOR \u00b6 1.d was referred to a collection agency in June 2001, \nand the delinquent account in SOR \u00b6 1.e was referred for collection in October 2003. \n \n \nThe $398 delinquent account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a telephone bill referred for \ncollection in October 2005. Applicant currently has a telephone account with this \ncompany. (Tr. 32) \n \n \nSince obtaining her current employment in August 2004, Applicant has not \nincurred any debt that has not been paid. In February 2003, she purchased a $20,000 \nvehicle. (Ex 5) She pays $374 per month on the vehicle and the account is in good \nstanding. Applicant is also current on her first and second mortgages that were obtained \nin September 2006. (Ex 4) Her mortgages total $980 per month. (Tr. 33) She purchased \nthe house for $97,000 and believes the fair market value to be $100,000. (Tr. 61)  \n \nShe currently has no credit cards. (Tr. 33) She either saves before making a \npurchase or uses lay-a-way to make purchases. (Tr. 58) She has recently purchased a \nrefrigerator by these means. Applicant\u2019s August 2006 performance review listed her \noverall performance as superior. (Ex. A) She currently takes home $1,129 twice a \nmonth. (Tr. 59) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5\n                                                          \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (financial considerations) a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.3 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an \n \n3 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n6\nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required \nto be debt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial \nobligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owes approximately $11,000 on 6 debts. Disqualifying Conditions \n(DC) \u00b6 19 a \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19 c \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \nThe debts are beyond the state statute of limitations. As such, the debts are no \nlonger enforceable in a court of law. This negates any risk Applicant will engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet these obligations. However, the \nstatute of limitation does not address the concern that someone who can not manage \ntheir finances may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in \nhandling or safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges the $1,794 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. She did not \nacknowledge SOR debts \u00b6 \u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.e, and the creditors have not substantiated those \ndebts. She maintains telephone service with the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f. It would be \nunlikely her current provider would continue service if she had a delinquent account. \n \nWhen faced with allegations of debt of unknown origins she acted reasonably. \nShe sent letters to the creditors in an attempt to verify the debts. One failed to respond \nand the others failed to produce documents verifying the debt. Individuals are expected \nto pay their past due obligations, but it is not reasonable to require a person to pay \nobligations creditors fail to validate simply because they appear on a credit bureau \nreport.  \n \nThe guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20 a, the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial problems were contributed to by changes of location caused by her job, \nperiods of unemployment and underemployment, and caring for her children.  \n \n\n \n7\nHer daughter no longer lives with her, and she has been steadily employed since \nAugust 2004. Since obtaining her current job, she had paid all debts incurred thereafter. \nHer periods of unemployment and underemployment are no longer extant. I find the \nbehavior occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it \ndoes not raise concerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 a.  \n \nUnder AG & 20 b, it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, \nunemployment and underemployment contributed to her financial problems. I find the \nevidence establishes this mitigating condition.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant no longer has credit cards. She is \ncurrent on her mortgage payment and her vehicle payment. She is not living beyond her \nmeans and saves for future contingencies. Although she did not receive financial \ncounseling, the problem is under control. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition \napplies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe allegations under Guideline E, (Personal Conduct) are refuted. The \nGovernment has shown Applicant's answers to questions 38 and 39 were incorrect, but \nthis does not prove the Applicant deliberately failed to disclose information about her \nfinances. The Applicant has denied intentional falsification. In November 2004, when \ncompleting her SF 86, Applicant did not list any debts as having ever been more than \n180 days delinquent or were currently more than 90 days delinquent. At the time she \ncompleted her SF 86, she was not receiving any calls or correspondence from creditors \nand simply forgot about the debts. \n \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance \nis a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification \nmust be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. An \nomission concerning delinquent debt is not deliberate if the person did not know of their \nexistence or failed to remember them. The Applicant did not know any of her accounts \nwere delinquent or remember any delinquent debts when completing her SF 86.  \n \nI found Applicant\u2019s explanation of her negative answers on her SF 86 plausible. \nAfter hearing her testimony, observing her demeanor, and evaluating all the evidence of \nrecord, I found her testimony credible on the falsification issue. I am satisfied she did \nnot intentionally falsify her SF 86.  \n \n\n \n8\nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations. Intentionally providing false answers on an SF 86 is a violation of \nFederal law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony. \n \nThe criminal conduct must be intentional and I have found Applicant\u2019s incorrect \nanswers in answering her SF 86 to be unintentional. I find for Applicant as to the \ncriminal conduct alleged.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant\u2019s job forced her to relocate to another state and then she move back. She \nsuffered periods of unemployment and underemployment until August 2004, when she \nobtained her current job. Following her relocation, she had difficulty paying her rent.  \n \nIn 2004, she obtained stable employment. After obtaining stable employment she \nhas been able to stay current on her accounts. She is credit worthy enough to have \npurchased a vehicle and a house and is current on her payments for these accounts. \nShe is not living beyond her means. The unusual circumstances that caused the \ndelinquent debts are no longer extant. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.  \n \n \n\n \n9\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2500 2.b: For Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 22, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nThe Board may not consider new evidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Therefore, information not already in the\n1\nrecord, including changes in account balances due to the passage of time, may not be taken into consideration.  \n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On April 7, 2008, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  \nApplicant argues that the Judge should have found her financial situation to be mitigated.\nApplicant identifies a number of statements in the Judge\u2019s decision which she considers to be error.\nApplicant also points out her abilities and contributions to the defense of the United States.  She\nrequests in the alternative that she be granted \u201capproval with [a] warning that future incidents of a\nsimilar nature may result in revocation of access.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Brief at 3, quoting Directive \u00b6\nE2.2(f).\nIn her response to the government\u2019s SOR, Applicant admitted all but four of the alleged\ndebts.  Her admissions established the government\u2019s case.  The burden then shifted to Applicant to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts she admitted.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable security clearance decision rested with Applicant.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  In her\nresponses, Applicant provided information about the origin of her financial difficulties.  She stated\nthat she was paying her current obligations in a timely manner, but (with the exception of one debt\nnot listed in the SOR) was not making payments on her past-due debts and intended to allow them\nto drop from her credit report with the passage of time.  At that time, she also noted some attempts\nto improve her financial situation, including consultation with a credit counselor, who advised her\nto allow the old debts to drop off, as noted above, as a strategy to raise her credit score. \nIn her decision, the Judge referred to the information Applicant provided.  The Judge\nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s financial situation was not mitigated because of  \u201cinsufficient information\nto establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debt.\u201d  Decision at 6.\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (May 23,\n2008).\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant identifies a number of statements in the Judge\u2019s decision which\nshe considers to be errors.   Applicant is correct that the Judge erred in stating that Applicant made\n1\n\nAs regards the obtaining of a security clearance, Applicant\u2019s reliance on the advice of her credit counselor is\n2\nmisguided.  A Judge is not bound to accept such advice as relevant to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance,\nsince a strategy to raise a credit score does not necessarily satisfy the government\u2019s security concerns.       \n3\npayments on a particular debt (not listed in the SOR) only until July 2004.  Decision at 2.  Applicant\ntold an investigator that she made payments only until July 2004 on a related but separate debt (SOR\n\u00b6 1.m).  The identified error is harmless in light of Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation, since it\nis unlikely that correction of that error would have lead to a different result in Applicant\u2019s case.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20638 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2005).  The other statements cited by\nApplicant are not in error, since they are reasonable characterizations or are otherwise supported by\nrecord evidence.2\nApplicant also argues that she has unique abilities and that denial of her security clearance\nwill be detrimental to the government in waging the Global War on Terror.  The Board has held that\nthe value of an applicant\u2019s expertise to a defense contractor or military service is not relevant or\nmaterial to determining the applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n99-0109 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).  An applicant\u2019s expertise is not a measure of whether that\napplicant demonstrates the high degree of judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that must be\nreposed in persons entrusted with classified information.  Id.\nIn the alternative, Applicant requests that she be granted \u201capproval with a warning that future\nincidents of a similar nature may result in revocation of her clearance.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2(f).  The\nBoard does not have authority to review cases de novo to consider such a request.  Accordingly,\nbecause the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable, the Board need not reach this issue.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\n      \nSigned: Michael D.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 29,\n2004. On August 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 29, 2007, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on January 2, 2008. Applicant received a\ncomplete file of relevant material (FORM) on January 8, 2008, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nApril 7, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted nine items in support of its contentions.\n1\nItem 4 (Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR, dated October 12, 2007).\n2\nItem 5 (Security Clearance Questionnaire, dated October 29, 2004).\n3\nItem 4 supra at note 2.\n4\nId.\n5\nId.\n6\nItem 7 (Response to Interrogatories, dated May 29, 2007).\n7\nId.\n8\n2\nGovernment\u2019s case.  Applicant submitted additional information. The case was\n1\nassigned to me on March 27, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated October 12, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e, 1.g-1.l, and 1.n-1.q of the SOR.   She denied the other\n2\nfactual allegations with explanations.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is single with\none adopted child. She has worked for her current employer since 1984.  Applicant has\n3\nheld a security clearance during her entire employment period. Applicant had no issues\nat work with handling secure items.\nIn March 2001, Applicant\u2019s father died. Shortly thereafter, in June 2002, her\nmother died. Applicant and her son lived in her mother\u2019s home. The home was sold as\npart of the inheritance.  Thus, she and her son had to move. Applicant purchased a\n4\nhome in September 2002. However, she could not afford the mortgage due to the\nadditional expenses associated with owning a home, such as utility bills. She used her\ncredit cards to supplement her income.  Thus, the accounts soon became delinquent.\n5\nApplicant managed to sell her home in February 2004. The proceeds paid the home\nmortgage and an equity loan. She had no money to pay the delinquent credit accounts.6\nIn February 2004, Applicant\u2019s son was involved in an at-fault automobile\naccident.  Applicant\u2019s insurance company did not pay the claim. Applicant arranged an\n7\ninstallment agreement with a subrogation firm. She paid $100 a month until July 2004. It\ndoes not appear that she made any more payments. The balance is now $2,178.8\nApplicant was interviewed in 2006 by Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ninvestigators. She stated her intention was to reach payment plans by March 2006 to\n\nItem 7 at 3.\n9\nItem 9 (Credit Bureau Report, dated March 2007).\n10\nItem 4 at 5-7.\n11\nItem 7 (Interview dated, dated February 2006).\n12\n3\nresolve her debts with her two major creditors.  This has not occurred. Her intent is to\n9\nreestablish her credit worthiness. She did not want to file for bankruptcy.\nApplicant admits to several small debts but has not resolved them. She will not\npay her past debts but will pay her current debts. She states her credit has improved\nand now she feels no action is required. They will disappear from her credit report. \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts. The total amount of debt is approximately\n$55,416.  Applicant admits to debts totaling approximately $29,822. She submitted\n10\npaperwork showing that she has recently visited a Consumer Credit Counseling Service\n(February 2008).  Applicant reports that the counselor reviewed the financial difficulties\n11\nand incidents in 2002-2004 and determined that the issues in the past are not hindering\nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation.\nApplicant disputes the debts to a credit card company in allegations 1.a and 1.b.\nIn 2007, she requested an investigation with the credit bureau. She maintains she never\nhad ownership of the collection account.\nAllegations 1.c-1.e are not in dispute. Applicant admits them. They are rather\nsmall debts ($185, $370, and $411). However, Applicant reported in 2007 since they are\nin collection or charged off that \u201cno further action is required\u201d. Allegation 1.f appears to\nbe a duplicate of 1.d and has been disputed.\nApplicant admits debts alleged in 1.g through 1.l. She again states that since\nthey are charged off or in collection that \u201cno further action is required.\u201d She states that\nthey will eventually fall off her credit report.\nApplicant denies the debt in allegation 1.m because she tried to resolve this after\nher son\u2019s accident. She did pay $100 a month until July 2004.\nThe remaining delinquent debts in 1.n-1.q are not denied or disputed. However,\nagain Applicant repeats her resolve not to take any further action.\nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income was $4,956. Her total monthly expenses were\n$3,150. Her net remainder was approximately $1,095.  She has assets and a\n12\nretirement account. These figures were current as of February 2006. Applicant was\npaying a monthly total of $711 for debt. This amount did not include payments for the\ndelinquent debts in the SOR. \n\nApplicant\u2019s submission to FORM.\n13\n4\nApplicant in her 2007 interrogatories listed the accounts in collection and on all of\nthem noted \u201cno further action.\u201d She emphasized that the charged off/closed accounts\ncannot be removed from her credit report and her only option is to rebuild her credit.\nShe is current on her other obligations. \nApplicant provided more detailed information in response to the FORM. In her\nletter of March 2008, Applicant affirmed that she has made efforts to pay her two largest\ncreditors in late 2006. She contacted them to see if she could make payments directly to\nthem. She was told since the accounts had been closed that they no longer make\npayment arrangements.\nApplicant is embarrassed about her previous financial difficulties. She is\nextremely proud of her efforts to improve her financial responsibilities. Her credit score\nhas increased from 480 in June 2006 to 689 in October 2007. She has two car loans in\ncurrent status. She also helped her sister through a difficult time. She now owns a new\ncredit card. \nApplicant\u2019s professional career has been outstanding. She has various\nachievement awards. In 2005, she earned the a very prestigious award from her\nemployer. She is praised for her creative and timely approach in developing a new\nproduct. Her negotiation skills are praised as well. Her performance evaluations are\noutstanding. She has received many promotions within the company.13\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n5\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. Her credit reports confirm that she has not paid the\ncharged off collection accounts. She admits approximately $29,130 in delinquent debt.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\n\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an order to Claim\nthe benefit of [the \u201cgood faith mitigating condition].applicant must present evidence showing\neither a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed\nat resolving the debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good faith.\u2019 However, the\nBoard has indicated that the concept of good-faith requires a showing the a person acts in\na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on\na legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or statue of limitations]) (Internal citation and\nfootnote omitted).\n ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3. (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd.\nJune 4, 2001)).\n6\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nmajor financial worries arose in 2002. She accumulated some delinquent debt due to\nher mother\u2019s death and son\u2019s automobile accident. She had to relocate and had more\nfinancial expenses than she could handle. While these events may have precipitated\nthe debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. Applicant has not resolved the debts.\nHer decision to take no further action and wait until the delinquent accounts fall off the\ncredit report raise concerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose from her mother\u2019s death and her son\u2019s accident. However,\nshe did not act responsibly in resolving her delinquent debts. I find this potentially\nmitigating condition does not fully apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has only recently (November 2008) contacted a\ncounseling firm. She still has no intention to begin a repayment plan because she is\nconvinced that her past financial difficulties do not hinder her current or future financial\nhealth. She is financially sound and has a steady income. There is insufficient\ninformation to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debt.14\nI conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant acknowledged the\ndelinquent debts were hers. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not\napply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\n adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has held a security\nclearance for more than 20 years. She has a stellar employment record with\noutstanding evaluations. She has had no problems at work with handling secure\ninformation. She had financial difficulties in 2003-2004 due to her mother\u2019s death in\nJune 2002. She and her son were living in her mother\u2019s home. After her mother\u2019s death\nthey had to relocate. She took on more financial responsibility than she could afford by\npurchasing a home. She decided not to file for bankruptcy.  She had a son to provide\nfor. These circumstances beyond her control exacerbated her difficulties but she did not\nact reasonably. Failure to pay debts is not prudent or responsible. She has been on\nnotice since 2006 that her security clearance was under investigation. She did state at\nthat time that she would start a repayment plan. She did not follow through. She did not\nenroll in a debt resolution plan for the debts. Her attempt to pay the two largest creditors\nended because she noted they were in collection and she would maintain her current\ncredit and improve her credit score rather than pay the older debts. Even an applicant\nwith a stellar employment record could have security concerns that raise doubts about\nher good judgment. She has not met her burden of proof in this case to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations.\n\n8\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g-q:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s June 29, 2007, cover letter to\nthe post-hearing submissions was marked as AE 31; the 2001 amended income tax return was marked AE 32; the 2002\namended income tax return was marked AE 33; the 2003 amended income tax return was marked AE 34; the 2004\namended income tax return was marked AE 35; and the 2005 income tax return was marked AE 36. Department\nCounsel\u2019s July 3, 2007, memorandum re-stating his objections was marked as Appellate Exhibit 1.\nSYNOPSIS\nFrom the fall of 2003 to around June 2005, Applicant knowingly employed an\nillegal alien as a live-in housekeeper-babysitter. The employment of an illegal alien\nviolates federal law. His extensive favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate\nthe personal conduct security concerns raised by his behavior. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 31, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application\n(GE 1, Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing). On September 28,\n2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a\nstatement of reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that DOHA adjudicators could not\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him access to classified information and submitted the case to an\nadministrative judge for a security determination.  On October 11, 2006, Applicant\n1\nanswered the SOR and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007. On May 23, 2007, DOHA issued a\nNotice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for June 19, 2007. On May 24, 2007,\nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested a postponement. I re-scheduled the hearing for June\n25, 2007. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The government presented one\nexhibit, marked GE 1 and the testimony of two witnesses to support the SOR.2\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and presented five witnesses and 36 exhibits,\nmarked AE 1-36.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 6, 2007.\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. After a thorough review of all evidence\nof record, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 43-year-old businessman. He attended high school at a state\nmilitary academy, graduating in 1983 (Tr. 211). He was admitted to a military\nservice academy and attended the service academy for three and one-half years. In\nhis third year, he used cocaine and tested positive during a drug screening urinalysis.\nHe was forced to withdraw from the military academy (Tr. 214-16). From June 1987\nto January 1989, Applicant attended college; graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in\ninternational affairs. Applicant married his wife in August 1989, and they have three\nboys of this marriage, ages 13, 11, and 8 (Tr. 210-11).\nFrom August 1989 to December 1998, Applicant worked for two different\ngovernment contractors. In January 1999, afraid his job was being terminated,\nApplicant founded his own company to provide information technology services and\nsolutions to the government and industry. During his first year in business,\nApplicant\u2019s company earned approximately $360,000. Thereafter, the company\nexperienced exponential growth. In 2006, his company employed 245 employees,\nhad earnings of approximately $40 million, and had over 15 contracts with different\ngovernment agencies (Tr. 220-22). His company has been recognized as one of the\n50 fastest-growing companies in the technology sector in the greater Washington DC\narea (Tr. 230-231). \nApplicant and his company have had access to classified information at the\nsecret level since approximately 2000. The available evidence shows Applicant\nnever failed to comply with the rules and procedures for handling classified\ninformation. Applicant also owns four other companies, a holdings company, an\ninformation technology services company, a real estate investment company, and a\ncomputer equipment surplus/resale company (Tr. 224). \nApplicant\u2019s company\u2019s exponential growth was the result of his long hours of\nhard work and sacrificing his time with his family. He and his wife divided their\nlabor and responsibilities; Applicant took care of managing the company, and his\nwife took care of managing the home and taking care of their children (Tr. 231).\nAround 2001, Applicant and his wife began to use the services of an 18-19\nyear-old Brazilian babysitter (V) who was recommended to them by one of their\nregular babysitters. Applicant and his wife believed V was legally in the United\nStates. She was residing with her uncle and aunt, both of whom are American\ncitizens living in the United States, and her aunt is a practicing attorney in the\nUnited States. \nAfter using V as a babysitter for a period of time, Applicant and his wife hired\nV, from approximately June 2002 to June 2005, as their live-in housekeeper-\nbabysitter. Applicant did not check V\u2019s background or legal status because he and\nhis wife had met with V\u2019s aunt and uncle, they liked her after having used her as a\nbabysitter for some time, and he felt pressured by his wife to hire V. His wife\nwanted a housekeeper-babysitter to help her take care of their home and their three\n\nboys. He was also pressured by his feelings of guilt because of the amount of time he\nwas spending at work and away from his family (Tr. 277-78).\nIn the fall of 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife informed him that V was illegally in the\nUnited States (Tr. 40, 280). His wife offered V an airplane ticket to go visit her\nfamily in Brazil. V refused it because if she left the United States she would not be\nallowed to return (Tr. 40). Applicant testified he considered firing V, but continued\nher employment until around June 2005. He explained she had become part of his\nfamily, and he believed it was not the right thing to do. As a Christian, he believed\nhe could not throw her out into the street without a family network to support her, or\nwithout a job (Tr. 43-44). \nApplicant and his wife offered to sponsor V into the United States, and to\nassist her with her immigration problems. Applicant testified V refused any\nassistance, and asked them not to interfere. V led them to believe she was already\nfiling for residency with the assistance of her aunt and uncle (Tr. 44, 281). In 2004,\nV informed Applicant she was getting married to a U.S. citizen. Applicant believed\nher marriage to a U.S. citizen would resolve her illegal status. V married in\nDecember 2004. Applicant paid for her wedding expenses because she did not have\nthe financial resources, and he felt it was the right thing to do. V left Applicant\u2019s\nemployment in May-June 2005 (Tr. 46). \nAround June/July 2005, Applicant realized he had a tax-wages problem\nbecause he had not paid social security taxes on V\u2019s wages or withheld federal\nincome taxes. He asked his accountant to resolve V\u2019s wages-tax issue. He was\ninformed he could not pay the taxes owed because he had no social security number,\ngreen card, or work permit number for V. Between May 2005 and January 2006, he\nand his wife attempted numerous times to contact V through her husband (who works\nin a bank), V\u2019s aunt and uncle, and friends, to no avail. After she left his\nemployment, V did not return Applicant\u2019s calls (except for one time she talked to\nApplicant\u2019s wife) or provide him with any information he could use to pay any due\ntaxes (Tr. 46-47).\nIn October 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application seeking\nan upgrade of his access to classified information. In his security clearance\napplication, he disclosed he attended the service military academy. He also disclosed\nthat in May 2003, he illegally used his wife\u2019s prescription drugs (Percocet) without\nhaving his own prescription. He explained he had three prior back surgeries for a\nruptured disk. In 2003, he knew he had injured another disk while participating in a\ntriathlon competition during the weekend. He elected to self-medicate instead of\ngoing to the emergency room to obtain a prescription for the medication (GE 1). The\nnext work day, Applicant visited his physician and obtained his own prescription. \nIn December 2005, Applicant requested a legal opinion from his professional\ntax preparer and asked him how to resolve V\u2019s tax problems. At the advice of his\nattorney, Applicant established a household company to pay back the overdue taxes\n\n  AE 21-25 and AE 32-35.\n4\nowed from 2001 to 2005 as a result of V\u2019s employment. Applicant filed his amended\nincome tax returns paying the back due wage taxes for 2001-2004, and his 2005\nincome tax return in October 2006.   \n4\nIn January 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a background investigator.\nDuring the interview, he voluntarily disclosed that his wife had hired an illegal alien\nto work as a live-in housekeeper-babysitter, and that he had not paid social security\nor withheld federal income taxes for V  (Tr. 35-37). According to the investigator\u2019s\nrecollection, Applicant acted as if he did not know he was required to withhold\nfederal taxes for his living-in housekeeper (Tr. 63-64), and Applicant knew before\nhe hired V that she was an illegal alien (Tr. 84). \nConcerning his failure to pay federal taxes pertaining to V\u2019s salary and social\nsecurity taxes, Applicant explained it was an oversight on his part because he did not\nprepare his own income tax returns. Since establishing his company, Applicant has\nused the services of a professional tax preparer to complete his income tax returns,\nand has delegated to his office assistant the completion of his tax preparation work\nsheet. He claimed the issue of paying taxes for a household employee was never\nraised by his tax preparer and he never realized he had to pay such taxes. It was not\nuntil a business meeting in the fall of 2005 that he realized he had a tax problem for\nnot having paid taxes pertaining to V\u2019s employment (Tr. 49-50).\nApplicant\u2019s witnesses and references, most of whom have known him for\nmany years, consider him an upstanding citizen, and a role model. Applicant has\nestablished a solid reputation for being trustworthy, honest, fair and caring, and for\nhaving high moral standards. He is not considered the type of person who would\nviolate the law or fail to follow rules and regulations. Among his employees and\nbusiness associates, Applicant has established a reputation for doing what is right\nand fair. Those who know him best consider him a devout Christian, a family man,\nand an outstanding father.\nProfessionally, Applicant is a highly successful businessman. He is\nrecognized as a good leader, and a caring and concerned employer. He is also a\nphilanthropist, having made approximate $350,000 in charitable contributions to\nschools, the community, and the needy from 2002 to 2007 (AE 18).\nI took administrative notice of \u00a7 1324a of Title 8 of the United States Code.\nThe statute, generally, makes it unlawful to employ or continue to employ an illegal\nalien (a person not authorized to be in the United States). This is civil statute that\nprovides for a potential civil fine of \u201cnot less than $250 and not more than $2,000\u201d\nfor each first time violation after an administrative hearing is completed.\nApplicant\u2019s violation was not pursued by the United States.\nPOLICIES\n\n  D irective, Section 6.3. states, \u201cE ach clearance decision must b e a fair a nd  imp artial\n5\nc o m m o n se nse  d e te rm ina tio n b ase d  u p o n co nsid e ra tio n o f all the  re le va nt and  m ate ria l info rm a tio n\nand the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2 . . .\u201d.\n  A G  \u00b6 2 (a ). sta te s, \u201cT he  a d jud ic atio n p ro c ess is the  c are ful w e ig h in g  o f a  num b e r o f\n6\nvariab les kn o wn as the who le perso n co ncep t.

Foremost\nare the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline\napplicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are\nnot viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common\nsense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the\n5\nwhole person concept.  Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I\n6\nconclude Guideline E (Personal Conduct) is the applicable relevant adjudicative\nguideline.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the initial burden of proving\n7\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must\nestablish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.  The responsibility then shifts\n8\nto the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of\npersuasion.  \n9\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\n\n  See Id; A G  \u00b6 2 (b).\n1 0\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.10\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this\nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance,\nloyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG & 15.\nFrom the spring of 2001 to June 2002, Applicant employed an illegal alien as\na babysitter. From June 2002 to June 2005, Applicant employed the illegal alien as a\nlive-in housekeeper-child care provider. He learned his live-in housekeeper was an\nillegal alien in the fall of 2003. He knew or should have known that employing an\nillegal alien was unlawful. Notwithstanding, he continued her employment until June\n2005, when she voluntarily left her job. Applicant failed to withhold federal income\ntaxes and pay social security taxes on his illegal alien employee during the whole\nperiod of time she worked for him. In October 2006, he filed amended income tax\nreturns for tax years 2001-2004, and his 2005 income tax returns paying his taxes.\nApplicant\u2019s overall behavior cast doubt on his judgment, his ability to comply\nwith rules and regulations, and make him potentially vulnerable to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress.\nPersonal Conduct disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be\nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality,\nrelease of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or\nother government protected information; (2) disruptive, violent, or other\ninappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule\nviolations; (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's\ntime or resources; and AG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information\n\nabout one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing . . ., apply.\nThe \ngovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nraising \npotentially\ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving\na mitigating condition never shifts to the government.\nAfter considering all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\n17, two are potentially applicable to Applicant\u2019s case:\n(c) the offense is so m ino r, or so m uch tim e ha s pa ssed, or the beha vio r is so\ninfreq u en t, o r it h a p p en ed  u n d er su ch  un iqu e circu m sta n c e s th a t it is u n likely to\nre cu r a n d  d o es n o t ca st d o u b t o n  th e  in d iv id u a l's re lia b ility , tru stw o rth in e ss, o r\ng o o d  jud g m en t; and\n(d) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(c) is partially applicable. Applicant\u2019s offense is\na civil violation. As such, in a grading scale, it is not as serious as a criminal\noffense. Applicant established that his hiring of the illegal alien, and failure to pay\nsocial security taxes and withhold federal taxes, happened under such unique\ncircumstances in his life that it is not likely to recur. Applicant was starting his own\ninformation technology company during a very difficult period of time, near to the\nstock market and the \u201cdot coms\u201d crash. He was working very long hours to establish\nhis company and that kept him away from home and his family. He wife was in\ncharge of managing the household and taking care of their young children. Applicant\nfelt pressured to go along with his wife\u2019s hiring decision without too much scrutiny.\nApplicant\u2019s situation has changed. His company seems to be solidly established, his\nchildren are older, and he does not appear to be under the same time constraints and\nbusiness pressure he once felt. Nevertheless, his conduct does cast doubt on\nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Therefore, he does not\nreceive full credit under AG \u00b6 17(c).\nConcerning mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(d), I find it fully applies. Applicant\nvoluntarily disclosed in his security clearance application, and to the government\ninvestigator, his questionable behavior. The evidence also shows he disclosed to his\nfamily, friends, and business associates that he was pending a security clearance\nhearing and the reasons behind the government\u2019s security concerns. Based on\nApplicant\u2019s disclosures, and considering his demeanour and truthful testimony, I\nbelieve he has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate any potential vulnerability\nto exploitation or duress.\n\n IS C R  C a se  N o . 0 3 -0 4 1 4 7  at 3  (A p p . B d . N o v. 4 , 2 0 0 5 ) (q uo ting IS C R  C a se  N o . 0 2 -0 1 0 9 3\n1 1\nat 4 (A p p . B d . D ec. 11 , 20 0 3 ).\nNotwithstanding the applicability of the two Guideline E mitigating\nconditions as previously described, Applicant\u2019s favorable information is not\nsufficient to mitigate the overall Guideline E concerns. \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as\ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related\nto the whole person concept under AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the\nAdministrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life\nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and\ncircumstances.\u201d  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (factors)\n11\nwhich are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. Additionally, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). Ultimately, the clearance\ndecision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(c).    \nApplicant hired a babysitter in 2001 believing she was legally in the United\nStates. By the time he discovered in the fall of 2003, that she had problems with her\nvisa and was illegally in the United States, the babysitter had become part of his\nfamily. Applicant and his family established a strong relationship with her. By all\naccounts, Applicant is a big\u2013hearted person and a religious man. He believed he was\ndoing the right thing by protecting her, keeping her in his employment, and assisting\nher to become a legal resident. \nApplicant knew, however, he also had the legal obligation not to continue his\nbabysitter\u2019s employment. From the fall of 2003 to May 2005, he elected to disregard\nhis legal obligations because of his personal and his family concerns for the\nbabysitter. Applicant\u2019s behavior, although admirable, raises concerns about his\njudgment and his ability to follow rules and regulations. His behavior creates doubt\nabout Applicant\u2019s ability to disclose a security violation committed by someone\nclose to him, if that person\u2019s employment or financial well being would be\njeopardized by the disclosure. \nI have carefully considered all of Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence. He was\nforthright and honest during his testimony. In January 2006, he voluntarily disclosed\nto an investigator that he had hired an illegal alien to work as a live-in housekeeper\nand that he had unpaid tax issues to resolve. He disclosed in his security clearance\napplication he had illegally used his wife\u2019s medications, and that he attended a\nservice military academy for three and one-half years. Applicant is considered by\nthose who know him best to be trustworthy, with high ethical and moral values. The\navailable evidence supports the conclusion that he lives a stellar life and is\nconsidered a pillar of the community. He is also highly successful as a businessman,\nand generously contributes financially and personally to the community.\n\n  D o rfm o nt v. B ro w n, 91 3  F.2d  13 9 9 , 14 0 1  (9  C ir. 19 9 0).\n1 2\nt h\nNotwithstanding his extensive favorable evidence, considering the totality of\nthe facts and circumstances, including his background, education, maturity, business\nexperience, and outstanding character, Applicant failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by his behavior.\n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong\npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .\nit is deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in\nsecurity by denying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d  After weighing the disqualifying\n12\nand mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the\nwhole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the foreign preference, personal\nconduct, and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

The debt that resulted in the bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond his\ncontrol. Approximately $11,000 of the post-bankruptcy debt was accrued on behalf of his ex-\nemployer and was in dispute for several years. Over the past two years, Applicant has retained a\ncredit correction agency and a credit counseling agency. He has been making debt payments\nconsistent with the agreements with creditors for the past five months. He has mitigated the security\nconcern. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1992, as amended. Applicant answered the SOR on March 15, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 9, 2007. On May 24, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing scheduling it for June 12, 2007. During the hearing, I received six government exhibits, 19\nApplicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open for him\nto submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted two documents received as\nExhibits T and U. DOHA received the transcript on July 6, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted to the allegations listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, and denied\nthe remainder. The admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old married man with an adult stepson. He has a high school diploma\nand is currently working toward an associate\u2019s degree in network administration.  He is an Army\n1\nveteran, retiring at the rank of sergeant first class (E 7) in 2000 after 21 years of service.2\nThroughout his career in the Army and the civilian world, he has worked as a telecommunications\nspecialist.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems beginning in  the early 1990s.

Because Applicant and his wife depended on both incomes to make\nends meet, they gradually began to fall behind on their debts.3\nAt approximately the same time, Applicant\u2019s grandfather who raised him died. He had to pay\nbetween two and three thousand dollars in funeral expenses.4\nIn December 1996, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, as alleged in\nsubparagraph 1.a. It included $32,000 of unsecured debt and $110,000 of secured debt.  Under the\n5\nbankruptcy payment plan, they were to pay $241 per month for three years. In December 1999, they\nsuccessfully completed the payment plan, and the court discharged the bankruptcy.6\nBetween January and July 2000, Applicant held a job that required extensive travel.  To\n7\nfacilitate the performance of his job duties, Applicant used a credit card to charge travel-related work\nexpenses, such as rental cars, hotel expenses, and meals.  Also, he was required to purchase any\n8\nequipment needed to complete his tasks while on travel. The expenses averaged between four and\nfive thousand dollars each trip.9\nUnder the arrangement with the employer, the credit card was issued in Applicant\u2019s name.\nAt the conclusion of each trip, Applicant was to submit the credit card bill to his employer,\nwhereupon the employer would pay it.10\nIn July 2000, Applicant was laid off as part of a company downsizing.  Before leaving, he\n11\nsubmitted reimbursement paperwork for his remaining corporate credit card debt.  After leaving,\n12\nhowever, he continued to receive bills from the credit card company. He then attempted to contact\nhis former supervisor for help in correcting the discrepancy, and discovered that he had also been\nlaid off.  Next, he tried to contact his ex-employer\u2019s central office to resolve the problem.  He was\n13\n14\n\nExhibit E, Receipt, dated April 19, 2007, Exhibit F, Undated Receipt, and Exhibit T, Undated Receipt.\n15\nTr. 91; Exhibit R, Credit Bureau Report, dated September 26, 2005, at 1.\n16\nTr. 92.

The creditors in the SOR rejected the counseling agency\u2019s offer to be included in the debt consolidation\n21\nplan.\n4\nunsuccessful. Consequently, the bill grew delinquent, and the creditor reported it, as alleged in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.b. \nApplicant contacted the creditor to contest the charges. It refused to remove them from his\nrecord. In March 2007, after his appeal was rejected, he developed a plan to pay the delinquency. The\nfollowing month, Applicant submitted $100 to the creditor. He has been making $100 payments\nsince that time.15\nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d allege delinquencies owed to the same creditor. Applicant denied\nthese bills in September 2005 when he discovered them on his credit report.  He retained a credit\n16\ncorrection agency to investigate.  Five months later, in March 2006, the creditor contacted him, and\n17\nconfirmed they were his responsibility.  In April 2007, he began paying them $25 per month.\n18\nCurrently, he has collectively paid $150 toward their satisfaction.  \n19\nApplicant disputed the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e. He contacted the creditor who\ninformed him the account was not his, and that it had been stricken from his record.20\nCurrently, Applicant has approximately $18,000 of debt. Approximately $3,200 was not\nincluded in the SOR. He owes approximately $11,000 toward the satisfaction of the corporate credit\ncard bill, and approximately $4,000 on the credit cards listed in 1.c and 1.d. He has been making\npayments on all of these debts since April 2007. In addition, he has attended a class in financial\nmanagement sponsored by the credit counseling agency he retained in March 2007.21\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n22\n5\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n22\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, FC DC 19(c):\na history of not meeting financial obligations, and FC DC 19(e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies either originated before 1996, or related to the\nnon-reimbursed, corporate credit card expenses he accrued seven years ago. Applicant\u2019s troubled\nfinances in the early 1990s were caused by several family crises including the serious illnesses of his\nin-laws, and the expenses associated with the death of his grandfather. Applicant\u2019s corporate credit\ncard debt grew delinquent because of the failure of his ex-employer to reimburse him after\nterminating his employment.\n\n6\nApplicant resolved the debts that accrued in the early 1990s by filing for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy in 1996 (subparagraph 1.a). His compliance with the plan led to a discharge of the\npetition in 1999. He disputed the corporate credit card delinquency, as alleged in subparagraph 1.b,\nin good faith. After his dispute failed, he arranged a payment plan to satisfy it. Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances, and FC MC 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem, and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue, apply. \nApplicant disputed subparagraphs 1.c through 1.e upon discovering them on his credit report.\nHe retained a credit correction agency to conduct an investigation. It revealed that subparagraphs 1.c\nand 1.d were his responsibility, and subparagraph 1.e was not his responsibility. He then made\narrangements to satisfy subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d, and has been steadily satisfying them since April\n2007. \nAlso, Applicant retained a credit counseling agency to help him with other debts not listed\nin the SOR, and has taken a financial management class through the agency. FC MC 20(c): the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control, and FC MC 20(d): the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, apply. Applicant has\nmitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems recurred less than two years after the successful execution of\na Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. The significance of this problem is outweighed by the circumstances\nsurrounding the accrual of the debt both before and after the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. In both\ninstances, it was caused primarily by circumstances beyond his control rather than irresponsible\nspending or bad judgment. Applicant has been actively engaged in the resolution of his financial\nproblems, retaining a credit correction agency to investigate disputed debts, and a credit counseling\nagency to help him pay undisputed ones. He has been making payments toward the satisfaction of\nhis debts for the past four months. Moreover, I was impressed with the organized manner he\ndiscussed his finances at the hearing. Evaluating these variables in conjunction with the whole\nperson concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

His answers on his 2004 security clearance application and during a \n2005 personal interview could have been more complete, but were not falsifications. In \n2003, he improperly recorded and stored the combinations for safes containing \nclassified material. The passage of time and Applicant\u2019s concerted efforts to adhere to \nsecurity procedures has rebutted or mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns \nunder handling protected information and personal conduct.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 \n \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nMarch 31, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on April 9, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nhandling protected information and personal conduct. \n  \n \nOn May 3, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nAugust 7, 2009, I was assigned the case. On August 17, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing for the hearing held on September 10, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits \n(Ex.) 1 through 10, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Exhibits A through V, which were admitted into evidence. On \nSeptember 25, 2009, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and \n2.e. He admitted the remaining factual allegations, with explanations. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of \nthe record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of \nfact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old computer systems engineer (Ex. D) who has worked \nfor a defense contractor since November 2004. His position as a computer systems \nengineer with his current company requires a security clearance. (Tr. 102) He has \nworked for various DoD contractors since 1984. (Tr. 151) Coworkers, supervisors, and \nassociates state: Applicant is hard working, a team player, mature, and one who \nparticipates in activities above and beyond what is required of him. His dedication, \ncharacter, and work ethic have been exemplary. For his outstanding work and \ncommitment to customer service, he was recognized as engineer of the quarter. (Ex. B, \nC, E\u2014H) His performance ratings have been \u201cmeets expectations,\u201d \u201cexceeds \nexpectations,\u201d or \u201coutstanding.\u201d (Ex. E) Applicant has completed numerous training \nprograms. (Ex. K\u2014V) Applicant\u2019s supervisor has never had reason to question \nApplicant\u2019s character, integrity, reliability, or trustworthiness. (Tr. 43, 48) Over the past \nthree years, Applicant has been nominated three times for employee of the quarter, \nwhich he won once. (Tr. 105)  \n \n \nIn October 2003, Applicant was terminated from a DoD contractor job after an \ninvestigation concluded he had improperly charged for time he had not worked. (Ex. 2) \nApplicant was going to another state for two weeks for work and to attend a seminar. \n(Tr. 92) He left his job early the week before his trip. While in the other state, Applicant \nhad no access to an electronic timecard so he called his supervisor to tell him he could \nnot log his work hours from his location. (Ex. 6, Tr. 93) Applicant never told his \nsupervisor he had left work early the previous week. On the third day of training, a \nsecurity officer talked with him and told him to fly back immediately to his duty location, \nbut not to return to his office until he heard from security. A couple of weeks later, \nApplicant was called, told he was being terminated, given the reason for his termination, \nand debriefed. (Tr. 94)  \n \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the DoD on September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct violated his employer\u2019s code of ethics. In July 2005, during a \npersonal subject interview, Applicant stated he had been terminated for \u201cfalsification of \nhis time sheet.\u201d (Ex. 6) Applicant acknowledged he was aware of the ethics code and \naware he had violated the code by having another person file his time card. (Ex. 6) \nApplicant admits he did not accurately annotate his hours on his time card, that this was \nwrong, and it lead to his termination. (Tr. 148) Applicant did not dispute his termination \nbecause he knew he violated the company\u2019s policy. (Ex. 6) \n \n \nDuring a personal subject interview in January 2007, Applicant acknowledged \nthat in May 2003, five months prior to his termination, he had been verbally counseled \nby his supervisor about his work hours. (Ex. 6) The company had core hours from 9:00 \nto 3:00. (Tr. 133) Applicant was asked to start at 7:00 so he would be present should his \nexpertise with the computer system be needed. (Tr. 133) Applicant had been working \nthe core hours and later into the afternoon and evening. The counseling had nothing to \ndo with the filling out of timecards. (Tr. 151)  \n \n \nIn 2003, following his termination, when his work area was cleared, a number of \npost-it notes were found containing the combinations to safes containing classified \ninformation. (Ex. 2, 5) In December 2003, an investigation found that a compromise of \nthe safe combinations had occurred. (Ex. 3) Applicant never saw the incident report until \nit was sent to him a few weeks before this hearing. (Tr. 127) Applicant has never denied \nthere were safes combinations written down in his work area. (Tr. 87) The combinations \nwere in an unclassified area where other employees or contract laborers would have \nfound them. There was no evidence of an active compromise of classified information. \n(Ex. 3)  \n \n \nApplicant did not dispute the handling protected information violation related to \nthe safe combinations existed. Applicant also admitted writing down passwords to the \nclassified computer system at work because he could not remember the passwords. \n(Ex. 6)  \n \n \nDoD 5520.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual \n(NISPOM), dated January 1995 (Ex. 9), and February 28, 2006 (Ex. 10), paragraph 5-\n308, Protection of Combinations to Security Containers, Cabinets, Vaults, and Closed \nAreas, provides: \n \nc. The combination shall be safeguarded in accordance with the highest \nclassification of the material authorized for storage in the container.  \n \nd. If a record is made of a combination, the record shall be marked with \nthe highest classification of material authorized for storage in the \ncontainer.  \n \n \nThe January 1995 NISPOM, paragraph 5-308(c) additionally requires that \nsuperseded combinations shall be destroyed. (Ex. 9) Applicant\u2019s supervisor testified that \n\n \n4 \n \ncombinations for safes which store classified information are classified to the level of the \nhighest classification of the container. (Tr. 55)   \n \n \nFrom October 2003 through November 2004, Applicant was out of work following \nhis termination. (Ex. 6) In November 2004, Applicant completed a security clearance \napplication, Standard Form (SF) 86. Question 20 of that form asked if Applicant had \nbeen fired from a job. Applicant stated he had been fired from a job in October 2003. He \nadmitted he had someone fill out his time card. He stated this was a violation of the \ncompany\u2019s time card standards. During a July 2005 interview, Applicant told an \ninvestigator he was terminated for falsifying his time card by having another employee \nfill out his time card. He did not say he was terminated for improperly charging for time \nwhen he was not at work. \n \n \nAt his current job, Applicant has never had a breach of security. (Tr. 59) Once he \nreturned to the industry, he made a concerted effort to be more aware of security \nconcerns. (Tr. 98) He no longer writes down combinations. \n \n \nApplicant has been married 30 years. He has two sons, the last one graduated \nfrom college a year ago. (Tr. 100) Except for this one-year of unemployment, he has \nspent 25 years working in the defense industry. (Tr. 100) In his current job, Applicant \nhas yearly security training and yearly ethics training. (Tr. 118) Information Assurance \ntraining is received quarterly. (Tr. 100) Applicant documents every single hour that he \nworks. (Tr. 158) For the past five years, Applicant has tried to mitigate his wrongful \nconduct in 2003. (Tr. 158)  \n \n \nIn his closing argument, Department Counsel argued that what Applicant said \nabout his termination was not false, but he failed to give the entire picture of Applicant\u2019s \ntermination. He asserted that Applicant should have provided more information than he \ndid. (Tr. 162) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 33 articulates the security concerns relating to \nhandling protected information: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Government has an unequivocal need to protect classified information within \nthe defense industry. Only those applicants who demonstrate the appropriate good \njudgment and reliability in the protection of such information will be granted the privilege \nof a security clearance. Applicant failed to properly safeguard the combinations to safes \ncontaining classified information, which violates paragraph 5-308 of DoD 5520.22-M, \nthe NISPOM. Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 34(g) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 35 provides two conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities.  \n \n \nApplicant has worked for DoD contractors since 1984. The 2003 conduct is the \nonly incident of Applicant having failed to properly safeguard classified information. He \nhas never denied he wrote down safe combinations to safes containing classified \ninformation. Applicant has worked in his current position for five years and has never \nhad a breach of security related to classified material. (Tr. 59) Applicant has tried to \nmitigate his 2003 wrongful conduct. (Tr. 158)  \n \n \nHis security violation occurred six years ago. Applicant has heightened his \nawareness toward security and he has demonstrated a positive attitude toward the \ndischarge of his security responsibilities. AG \u00b6 35(a) and \u00b6 35(b) apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe following sections of AG \u00b6 16 describe conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n7 \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations. \n \n \nIn October 2003, Applicant was terminated for improperly charging for time when \nhe was not at work. Following his termination, when his work area was cleared, it was \ndiscovered Applicant had improperly recorded and stored combinations to safes \ncontaining classified material. As previously discussed, this was a security violation, in \nviolation of paragraph 5-308, DoD 5220.22-M. AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) applies to the time card \nviolation and his termination. The security violation and termination have already been \ndiscussed in the Guideline K analysis. There is nothing under the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns, which would indicate a different finding that what is provided above.  \n \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the Government, when applying for a security clearance, \nis a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification \nmust be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  \n \n \nWhat Applicant stated in his SF 86 was true. He was fired for a violation of his \ncompany\u2019s time card standards. What he said during his 2005 interview was also true. \nHe specifically stated he had been terminated for falsification of his time sheet. He could \nhave gone farther and stated he had claimed he was working when he was not at work, \nbut did not.  \n \n \nDepartment Counsel acknowledged Applicant\u2019s statements about his termination \nwere not false, but asserted Applicant should have provided more information than he \ndid. He argues Applicant=s responses did not go far enough. Applicant should have \nrevealed he was terminated for improperly charging for time he had not worked. In this \ncase, Applicant\u2019s failure to provide additional information does not, in itself, prove he did \nso in a deliberate effort to conceal those facts from the government. From his answers, \nthe government knew he was terminated because he had falsified his time card.   \n \n \nApplicant did not dispute his termination because he knew he violated the \ncompany\u2019s policy and acknowledged he was aware of the ethics code. Applicant \ncredibly testified that he was not trying to mislead the government. Applicant=s \nstatements about his intent, or state of mind, at the time he executed his SF 86 and \nduring his interview are relevant and material, but not conclusive. Intent to deceive or \n\n \n8 \n \nmislead the government does not require direct evidence and can be inferred from \ncircumstantial evidence, but this is not the case here. When his statements are \nweighted in light of the evidence as a whole, I find his answers on his SF 86 and during \nhis interview were not deliberate omissions, concealments, or falsifications, Therefore, \nnone of the disqualifying conditions under personal conduct apply.  \n \n \nIn May 2003, Applicant was counseled about his working hours. The counseling \ndealt with making sure he, as a computer technician, was at work during the hours \nwhen the customers or clients were most likely to need computer support. He had been \nworking the core hours of 9:00 to 3:00, but his supervisor wanted him to come in earlier \nin the day instead of staying later in the day as was Applicant\u2019s habit. The counseling \nhad nothing to do with accounting for his work on his timecards. Nothing about the \ncounseling casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or \nwillingness and ability to safeguard classified information. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Six years ago, Applicant was \nterminated from his job for improperly charging for time he did not work. He \nacknowledged this was wrong and inappropriate conduct. He has shown he has learned \nhis lesson. In the past six years, he has done all that he could do to have trust in him \nrestored. Following a year of unemployment, he has acted to mitigate his wrongful \nconduct in 2003. Once he returned to the industry, he made a concerted effort to be \nmore aware of security concerns. (Tr. 98) He no longer writes down combinations. \nApplicant is now extremely vigilant as to handling protected information. He is very \ncareful to safeguard classified material. He has yearly security training, yearly ethics \ntraining, and quarterly information assurance training. He has spent 25 years in the \n\n \n9 \n \ndefense industry. Knowing what his inappropriate conduct cost him in 2003, it is unlikely \nhe would repeat that conduct. His answers to his SF 86 and during his 2005 interview \ncould have been more complete, but he did not falsify his answers.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his handling protected \ninformation and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Handling Protected Information: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20142.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

During a\n2006 interview with an investigative agent, he provided misleading, incomplete information about\nthe relationship, and the circumstances leading to his reassignment. Applicant failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concern generated by this conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1992, as amended. Applicant answered the SOR on November 24, 2006. He admitted the allegation\nlisted in subparagraph 1.b, denied the allegations listed in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.c, and requested\na hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 26, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March\n29, 2007, scheduling it for April 20, 2007. During the hearing, I received two government exhibits,\nfourteen Applicant exhibits, the testimony of a government witness, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At\nApplicant\u2019s request, I left the record open through May 4, 2007 to allow him to submit additional\nexhibits. Before the deadline, he submitted four additional exhibits which I marked and received as\nExhibits O through R. DOHA received the transcript on May 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old single man with a high school education. He served in the U.S.\nArmy from 1980 to his retirement in 2000. During that time, he served in a special forces unit.  In\n1\n1991, he was promoted to an operations sergeant.2\nApplicant\u2019s Army career was highly successful. His superiors repeatedly characterized him\nas an outstanding soldier with \u201cunquestionable integrity, candor, and selfless service.\u201d  According\n3\nto a U.S. Army brigadier general who has known him for ten years, Applicant \u201cis not only extremely\ncompetent in every field of endeavor, but . . . never fails to take advantage of every opportunity\n\nLetter of Recommendation, dated August 4, 2000, as included in Exhibit C at 1.\n4\nLetters of Recommendation dated September 5, 2000 and August 30, 2000, as included in Exhibit C at 2. \n5\nTr. 50.\n6\nTr. 48.\n7\nExhibit 1, Security Clearance Application, dated February 25, 2004; Tr. 48.\n8\nExhibit 2, Security Violation report at 7; see also, Tr. 64, Overseas Briefing Certificate, signed by Applicant\n9\non February 27, 2004, as included in Exhibit 2 at 19.\nTr. 76.\n10\nTr. 58.\n11\nTr. 68.\n12\n3\navailable for furthering his own development.   Both his detachment commander , and the lieutenant\n4\ncolonel of his special forces unit stated he was one of the finest non-commissioned officers with\nwhom they had ever worked.5\nSince retiring from the Army in 2000, Applicant has been working as a construction\nsurveillance technician (CST). His tasks include supervising the renovation and construction of U.S.\nembassies worldwide. Specifically, he ensures that foreign nationals hired to work on the various\nprojects do not enter controlled access areas without authorization or \u201cimplant any surveillance\ndevices, explosive devices, or that they are not casing the building[s] . . .for hostile act[s].\u201d  He is\n6\nan independent contractor who is assigned to various projects from six months to a year.  When a\n7\nproject is completed, he returns to the U.S., and goes on leave without pay status until his employer\nassigns him to another project.\nApplicant has worked as an independent contractor for the past six years.  With the exception\n8\nof a one-month period in 2003, he has contracted with the same company during that time. When\nhired, his employer briefed him on his security responsibilities including, among other things, his\nresponsibility to report contacts with foreign nationals that \u201cevolve into continued social or intimate\ncontact.\u201d9\nIn February 2004, Applicant was assigned to a project in an African country. While there, he\nsupervised a team of approximately 14 men.  Approximately three weeks later, he and his team\n10\nbegan socializing at a local bar where several women from various Asian countries worked.\nApplicant became romantically involved with one of them.11\nAfter learning that some of the women may have been from the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC), Applicant and his team reported these foreign contacts to their supervisor who then ordered\nthem not to return to the bar, and to report subsequent foreign contacts. At that time, Applicant did\nnot report that he had become intimately involved with one of the women, reasoning as follows:\nI already had her phone number. So I could just call her and ask her if she wanted to\ncome over to the apartment. I didn\u2019t need to go back to that bar.12\n\nExhibit 2 at 5. \n13\nTr. 65.\n14\nExhibit 2 at 7.\n15\nId.\n16\nMemorandum of Applicant (undated) as included in Exhibit 2 at 3\n17\nStatement of Program Manager, as included in Exhibit A, Investigative Agent\u2019s Report of Investigation, dated\n18\nJanuary 12, 2006 through February 12, 2006, at 7.\nExhibit L, Recommendation Letter of Site Security Manager, dated December 14, 2004.\n19\nId.\n20\nTr. 48.\n21\n4\nApplicant did not know his paramour\u2019s national origins when they first began dating.\nApproximately six months later, in July 2006, she told him that she was from the People\u2019s Republic\nof China. (PRC).  He continued to see her for another five months. He did not think it was a\n13\nproblem, because she told him she was from the Hong Kong region, which he thought \u201c[fell] under\na per se different rule.\u201d14\nOn December 13, 2004, Applicant reported the relationship to the project\u2019s assistant regional\nsecurity officer. He then contacted his girlfriend and asked her to show him her local residency\npaperwork.  The paperwork confirmed that she was a PRC native. Applicant then resigned from\n15\n16\nthe assignment, asserting that he had \u201cundermined [his] present position\u201d  by not reporting the\n17\nrelationship earlier.\nApplicant continued to work on the project for another three weeks to help with the\ntransition.  Approximately three weeks later, he returned to the U.S. where he was interviewed by\nthe diplomatic security office of the U.S. Department of Justice. (DOJ) They completed an\ninvestigation, and concluded no compromise of classified information occurred.\nThe DOJ investigation had already begun at the time Applicant reported the contact. It was\nprompted by a coworker who had observed the relationship and reported it to their supervisor\napproximately five months before Applicant reported it.  The record is inconclusive with respect\n18\nto whether the ongoing investigation influenced Applicant\u2019s decision to report the relationship.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisors were supportive of him throughout the entire investigation, and\nadvocated for him to remain at their company on another assignment. The day after he resigned from\nthe African assignment, the site supervisor wrote him a recommendation letter stating, among other\nthings, that Applicant\u2019s performance was \u201csuperb,\u201d  and that he was \u201cvery conscientious with\n19\nrespect to construction surveillance support requirements.\u201d20\nApproximately two months after resigning, Applicant was transferred to another embassy\nconstruction project.  He worked on that project through its completion, and was assigned to another\n21\n\nId.\n22\nExhibit O, Reference Letter of Site Security Manager, covering the time period from February 28, 2006 to\n23\nFebruary 26, 2007.\nTr. 26 \u2013 Investigator\u2019s Testimony.\n24\nTr. 27 \u2013 Investigator\u2019s Testimony.\n25\nId.\n26\nTr. 21.\n27\nTr. 30.\n28\n5\none in approximately January 2006 where he worked through February 2007.

The investigator reviewed each\nquestion with Applicant. In response to Question 20 (Has any of the following happened to you in\nthe past 7 years -Fired from job - Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired -Left a job by mutual\nagreement following allegations of misconduct - Left a job by mutual agreement following\nallegations of unsatisfactory performance - Left a job for other reason under unfavorable\ncircumstances) he did not mention his resignation from the assignment in December 2004.\nLater, the investigator asked about foreign contacts. In response, Applicant mentioned a\nChinese \u201cgirl\u201d he met at a bar.  He reported the contact, and \u201ceverything was fine.\u201d At the close\n24\n25\nof the interview, he stated there was nothing that could \u201ccome up during the process of [the]\ninvestigation from records or from personal sources that may contradict anything [he] told [the\nagent].\u201d  When asked whether it created any other problems, he said \u201cno.\u201d  Given that Applicant\n26\n27\ntold the agent \u201ceverything was okay\u201d it did not raise \u201ca red flag\u201d with the investigator.28\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n29\n6\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n29\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s relationship with a woman from PRC while working overseas generates a\nsecurity concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16 (e): personal conduct,\nor concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress. His responses to questions about the relationship during a 2006 interview\nwith an investigator raise the issue of whether PC DC 16 (b): deliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official,\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative, applies. \nApplicant ended the relationship approximately two and a half years ago. He voluntarily\nresigned from the assignment, and was transferred to another one after an investigation concluded\nno compromise of classified information occurred. His job performance has been exemplary since\n\n7\nthe incident. PC DC 17 (e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, applies.\nApplicant has worked continuously for the same employer whom he worked in December\n2004. He resigned from an assignment not a job. Consequently, he did not mislead the investigator\nwhen he did not mention the resignation from the 2004 assignment, when requested to update\nQuestion 20 of the SF 86.\nWhen asked about foreign contacts, however, Applicant provided a technically accurate, but\nincomplete and misleading response. In reaching this conclusion, I was particularly cognizant of\nApplicant\u2019s history of honesty and candor, as noted by several of his character references. His\nadmirable reputation could not overcome the doubts generated by his response to the investigative\nagent, and his testimony at the hearing. PC DC 16 (b) applies without mitigation.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s career, both in the Army and as a private contractor, has been extraordinary. I\nam unable, however, to reconcile his decades of exceptional job performance with his 2004 violation\nof his employer\u2019s security protocol, and his failure to be fully forthcoming about it when interviewed\nby an investigative agent in 2006. When Applicant\u2019s supervisor told him to quit going to the bar\nwhere he met his paramour, he technically obeyed the order, but kept seeing her, reasoning their\ncontact was acceptable so long as he did not return to the bar. His responses to the investigator\nduring the 2006 interview were similarly disingenuous. Security clearance candidates not only have\na duty to respond truthfully to an investigator\u2019s questions, they must respond candidly, as well.\nMoreover, employer orders are to be obeyed not evaded. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security\nconcern.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline J concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on October 23, 2007, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to\n\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit U for Identification is a document prepared by Applicant\u2019s Counsel entitled \u201cSummary and\n1\nMitigating Conditions.\u201d  This exhibit was not entered into evidence.\n2\nproceed on January 14, 2008.  I received the case assignment on January 25, 2008.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 11, 2008, setting the hearing for March\n18, 2008.  Due to a medical emergency involving the Applicant a continuance was\ngranted.  A new notice of hearing was issued on March 18, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on April 8, 2008. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\nthrough 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\ncalled four additional witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through T and V,\nwithout objection.   DOHA received the transcript of the hearing, and the record closed,\n1\non April 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 43, divorced but has a long-term partner.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Applicant has had three criminal incidents in 25 years.  The first criminal\nincident happened in February 1983.  On that occasion the Applicant was cited with\nPossession of Less than One Ounce of Marijuana.  He pled guilty and worked four days\nof community service in lieu of paying a fine of $100.00.  The Applicant was 18 years\nold at the time.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 2-3; Transcript at 85-86, 121-126.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s next criminal incident happened a month later, in March 1983.\nHe was still only 18 years old at the time.  On this occasion the Applicant and a friend\nbroke into a house and stole various items.  He was quickly arrested for this incident.\nThe Applicant subsequently went to court, was found guilty, and sentenced to a year\nformal probation, he served eight months and 20 days in jail of a 365 day sentence, and\nwas fined $2,000.00.  At the end of his probation period the Court entered an order\ndeeming the offense to be a misdemeanor, probation was terminated, the guilty plea set\naside and the case was dismissed.  (Government Exhibits 1, 2 and 3; Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit T; Transcript at 86-89.)  \nThe Applicant\u2019s copy of his probation requirements, found at Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nT, does not show a restriction on the possession of firearms.  The Applicant had a good\nfaith belief that, because of this document, and the fact his case had been ordered\ndeemed a misdemeanor, he did not have any restrictions on his possessing firearms.\n(Transcript at 88-89, 136-139.)  As set forth further below, in that he was mistaken.\nSubsequent to his incarceration, the Applicant turned his life around and began\nbeing a successful and law-biding citizen.  After several menial jobs, he began work in\n\nMore information is set forth in \u201cMitigation,\u201d below.\n2\n3\nthe Defense industry in October 1988.  This was with a predecessor company to his\ncurrent employer.  Over the next 18 years the Applicant worked hard and was given\nseveral promotions.   He and his wife divorced in 2000, but he has lived with a long-\n2\nterm partner and her four children since that time.  His natural son died tragically at the\nage of 18 in 2005.\nThe Applicant\u2019s last arrest occurred on August 11, 2006.  On that day, the then\n11 year old son of his partner got in an argument with a playground monitor and\nthreatened to \u201cblow up the school.\u201d  In a surplus of caution the police were called and\nbrought the boy to the Applicant\u2019s home.  They asked for permission to search the boy\u2019s\nroom.  In the room the police found a target rifle and ammunition that were stored there\nin preparation for the Applicant taking the youngster and his older brother out target\nshooting.  As stated earlier, the Applicant had a good faith belief that there were no\nrestrictions on his possessing firearms.  He and his partner were arrested and charged\nwith Child Endangerment.  In addition, he was also charged with four counts of\nPossessing a Firearm while a Felon, and two counts of Unlawfully Possessing a\nFirearm.  He plead guilty to one count of Unlawfully Possessing a Firearm and was\nsentenced to three years formal probation, $200.00 fine, two days in jail (with credit for\ntime served) and not associate with the minor children of his partner, who lost custody\nof her minor children because of the offense.  Both the Applicant and his partner freely\nadmit that the decision to store the weapons in the boys\u2019 room, even temporarily, did not\nshow good judgment.  The Applicant testified at length about how he would instruct the\nboys in weapons safety.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit P;\nTranscript at 64-69, 74-80, 98-107, 112-119, 136-139.) \nMitigation\nNumerous letters of recommendation, job related documents, and the testimony\nof several co-workers, show that the Applicant is a highly respected person and co-\nworker.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C through S.)  All of the witnesses and correspondents\nhave considerable experience in the Defense industry and have held security\nclearances for many years.  All of them have known the Applicant for more than 8 years\nas a co-worker and friend, some for almost 20 years.  Those that testified indicated that\nthey had specific knowledge of the incidents referred to in the SOR.\nThe co-worker who first hired the Applicant in 1988, and was his supervisor for\nsix years from 1988 to 1994, testified and submitted a statement.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nC.)  He stated, \u201c[The Applicant] has always been one of the most responsible people I\nhave ever known. . . . He has always been very reliable on the job.\u201d  (Transcript at 30.)\nThe witness further stated that the Applicant \u201cwas without a doubt one of the best\nworkers I ever had.\u201d  (Transcript at 31.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s supervisor from 2000 to 2002 also testified and submitted a\nstatement.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)  He has known the Applicant since 1998.  The\nwitness discussed the importance of the Applicant\u2019s job and how well he performed it.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits D and J are also from former supervisors.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G, H, J, K, M, N, Q and\n3\nV are from work associates.  The tenor of these letters is the same as those already quoted.  See also\nTranscript at 39-46 for the testimony of the person who submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit V.\n4\n(Transcript at 55-52.)  He describes the Applicant as \u201ca trustworthy individual.\u201d\n(Transcript at 54.)\nA Branch Supervisor who has worked with the Applicant for 10 years, and known\nhim almost 20, submitted a statement.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)  He states, \u201cOf the things\nthat set [the Applicant] above any other individual with whom I have had the privilege of\nworking is he always conducts himself in a professional manner and is always looking to\nimprove and refine his skills.\u201d\nA person who supervised the Applicant from 1998-2001 and from 2007 to date\nalso submitted a statement.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I.)  He describes the Applicant as \u201can\nhonest, upright and conscientious individual.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit L was submitted by a close friend and co-worker of the\nApplicant, who has known him for almost 20 years.  The witness states, \u201c[The Applicant]\nis honest with those in his life, both on a personal and professional basis; he is reliable,\ntrustworthy, respected by his peers, responsible at work, exercises good judgment, and\nis an overall good citizen.\u201d 3\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n5\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant was involved in criminal incidents twice in 1983 and once in 2006.\nAG \u00b6 31(a) applies to this case, stating that a disqualifying condition is \u201ca single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d  In addition, the Applicant is \u201ccurrently on parole,\u201d\nthereby bringing AG \u00b6 31(d) into effect.\nThe first two incidents happened when the Applicant was quite young and, by his\nown admission, foolish.  The last occurred because the son of the Applicant\u2019s partner\nmade a threat at school, which had to be taken seriously in today\u2019s environment.  The\n\n6\nApplicant submitted compelling evidence that he had a good-faith, but mistaken,\nimpression that he could possess firearms.  He could not.  When the weapons were\nfound in his house, the Applicant violated the law, with or without his knowledge.  He\nadmits that.  He also admits that it was poor judgment to have the weapons in the\nchild\u2019s room.\nThe Applicant\u2019s credible testimonial evidence is that he has learned his lesson\nfrom these incidents.  He showed a mature grasp of what happened here, and why, and\nhow to avoid it in the future.  \nUnder the particular facts of this case, several of the mitigating conditions also\napply and justify a finding for the Applicant as to this Guideline.  They are AG \u00b6 32(a ),\n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d; and AG \u00b6 32(b), \u201cthere is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d \nThe Applicant submitted compelling evidence from no less than 14 co-workers\nwho support the Applicant\u2019s desire to retain a security clearance.  With knowledge of the\noffenses, these people discussed their years long relationship with the Applicant, some\nof upwards of 20 years.  He is described as a trustworthy co-worker and a man who is\neminently eligible for a security clearance.\nBased on the available evidence, the most recent offense was one of ignorance,\nbut which was nevertheless criminal.  However, it occurred under unusual\ncircumstances which are not going to recur and do not cast doubt on the Applicant\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.  In addition, he is an outstanding worker\nand has been very forthcoming about this offense.  All of the evidence leads me to the\nconclusion that this incident was an aberration after 20 plus years of blemish free life.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who has overcome his criminal acts.  As described at\nlength above, the first two incidents happened when he was a very young man.  He did\nnot realize that one of those early incidents could follow him throughout his life and lead\nto the arrest and conviction in 2006.  However, the Applicant is someone with an\nextensive DoD work history which shows that he is not someone who ordinarily uses\npoor judgment or is a career criminal.\nThe Applicant well understands what happened and why, and has expressed a\ncredible intent not to allow such errors to occur in the future.  Accordingly, I find that\nthere have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Finally, I find that\nthere is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)),\nand that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant failed to mitigate both concerns.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 10, 2001, and September 4, 2003, Applicant submitted two\nseparate security clearance applications (SF 86).  On August 29, 2006, the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to\nhim, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  \n2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and\nJ (Criminal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer notarized on October 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing. On March 28, 2007,\nthe case was assigned to an administrative judge.  On April 4, 2007, the case was\ntransferred to me.  On May 2, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the\ncase to be heard on May 22, 2007.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  On May 31,\n2007, DOHA received the transcript.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and\n2 with explanations.  \nApplicant is 34 years old.  Since March 2006, he has been employed by a\n3\ndefense contractor working on enterprise class systems.  Tr. 90.  Additionally, in\n\nAugust 2006, Applicant along with two other colleagues began their own business\nproviding high assurance products to clients in a classified environment.  Tr. 118.\nHis title in this company is chief technology officer.  His employment requires a\nsecurity clearance.  Tr. 16-18, 22.\nApplicant was awarded a bachelor of science degree in May 1997, majoring in\ncommunications.  Upon completion of his undergraduate studies, he attended\ngraduate school majoring in speech communications and completed all required\ncourse work, but did not complete his thesis.  Tr. 15-16.\nHe has no military service. He married his wife in October 1997, and they\nhave one child, a seven-year-old son. \nIn May 1995 at age 22, Applicant was convicted of criminal possession of a\nweapon in the third degree.  In April 1995, he purchased a stolen weapon for the\npurpose of committing suicide.  His attempted suicide was thwarted after his ex-\ngirlfriend intervened and contacted the authorities. Although his suicide attempt was\nunsuccessful, his possession of a stolen weapon resulted in his being arrested,\nconfined for two months, and convicted of a felony.  He was sentenced to time\nserved and five years probation.  Tr. 23-25. GE 6. He was released from probation\nfor good behavior in April 1997 after serving 18 months.  Among the terms of his\nprobation was abstinence from alcohol and illegal drugs, which he testified he\ncomplied with.  Tr. 29-35, GE 6.\nApplicant has a history of drug abuse, which formed the basis of the Personal\nConduct SOR allegations discussed below.\n Personal Conduct\nQuestion 27 of Applicant\u2019s October 27, 2001, SF 86 asks, \u201c27. Your Use of\nIllegal Drugs and Drug Activity \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs Since the age of 16 or in\nthe last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled\nsubstance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics\n(opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates,\nmethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.)., hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription\ndrugs?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cYes\u201d and listed marijuana use from August 1992 to\nMay 1995 once a week.  \nThe SOR alleged in \u00b6 1.a. \u201cwhereas in truth, you deliberately failed to disclose\nyour additional marijuana use as set forth below: (1) You used marijuana, with\nvarying frequency, from about May 1995 to at least 2001.\u201d  Applicant testified on\ncross-examination the range of dates involving his drug abuse from August 1993 to\nMay 1995 are the correct dates.  Tr. 79.\nQuestion 27 of Applicant\u2019s September 4, 2003, SF 86 asked the same question,\nsupra.  Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d \n\n GE 4.\n4\nThe SOR alleged in \u00b6 1.b. \u201cwhereas in truth, you deliberately failed to\ndisclose your use of marijuana within the past seven years as set forth below: (1)\nYou used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about September 1996 to at least\n2001.\u201d  \nOn July 16, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service\n(DSS) Special Agent and provided a signed, sworn statement.  Of note, Applicant\nsubmitted this entire statement in his own handwriting.  Salient portions of that\nstatement include:\nI used marijuana approximately 25 times between 1991 and 2001.  The\noverwhelming majority of this use was from about 1991 to 1995.  I did\nuse marijuana a few times between 1996 and 2001.  . . . I have\nabsolutely no intent on using any illegal drugs in the future.  I have not\nmade any purposeful attempt to obtain marijuana or any other illegal\ndrug since 2001.  . . . The only family member I know for sure that used\nillegal drugs was my father in law (. . .) and my brother in law (. . .).\nTo the best of my knowledge they only used marijuana. . . . I no longer\nassociate with anyone outside of my father in law who uses illegal\ndrugs.  . . . My wife has never used marijuana in my presence.  My wife\ncurrently does not use marijuana or any other illegal drugs.  My wife\nnever plans on using marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future.\nBased upon information my wife gave me, she did use marijuana a few\ntimes in the past, but I never saw it.  . . . I answered illegal drug\nquestions on my SF-86 dated 4 September 2003 incorrectly.  This was a\nregretful oversight.  At the time of filling out my security forms I was\nnervous and anxious about my clearance and career.   \n4\nApplicant testified the DSS Special Agent who interviewed him advised him\nthat he had two statements from two separate individuals suggesting greater\nmarijuana usage than Applicant claimed in his SF 86s.  The net result of this\ninterview culminated in Applicant preparing a sworn statement, which he wrote in\nhis own handwriting quoted verbatim supra. Applicant testified the Special Agent\n\u201cbasically told me what to write.\u201d  Applicant further testified the Special Agent\n\u201cverbally read off what I should write in the statement.\u201d  Applicant testified that that\nthe words, \u201cI did use marijuana a few times between 1996 and 2001\u201d were the\nSpecial Agent\u2019s words and not true.  After preparing the statement in his own\nhandwriting, Applicant initialed each paragraph before swearing its contents were\ncorrect and true as written adding the DSS Special Agent assisted him in preparation\nof this statement.  Tr. 44-58.  On cross-examination, Applicant stated he thought\nduring the interview, he had to write down what the Special Agent dictated even if\nnot true and to sign adopting the agent\u2019s statement as his own.  Tr. 76.\nApplicant discussed this statement with his wife when he got home and\ntestified he \u201cfelt sick to my stomach.\u201d  Tr. 58.  In their discussions about this\nstatement, Applicant recalled that his wife had no recollection of her drug use.  Tr.\n\n GE 5.\n5\n GE 1, and GE 2.\n6\n59.  Applicant did not contact his Facility Security Officer or attempt to contact DSS\nto correct his statement.  When asked why he did not do either, he responded \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t know.\u201d Tr. 59.  Applicant stated that he did not know providing a statement\nwas voluntary.  Tr. 71-72.\nOn June 12, 2003, Applicant submitted an earlier signed, sworn statement to a\nDSS Special Agent.    Verbatim portions of that statement are: \n5\nDuring 1988, at age 15, I experimented with marijuana on one\noccasion.  From Aug 91 to May 95, while a college student, I used\nmarijuana on a once weekly basis at parties and get-togethers while in\nthe company of college friends. . . . I stopped using marijuana in May\n95 because I wanted to change my life.\nApplicant provided derogatory/unfavorable information about himself in both\nSF 86s in Questions 19 (Medical Record), 22 (Employment Record), 21 (Police\nRecord \u2013 Felony Offenses, 22 (Police Record \u2013 Firearms/Explosives Offenses, and\n38 (Financial Delinquencies).  \n6\nCriminal Conduct\nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that information set forth under paragraph 1., above\nconstitutes a violation of Federal law, Title, 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a\nfelony.   \nA former supervisor, colleague, and retired naval officer testified on\nApplicant\u2019s behalf and referred to him as \u201cone of the best engineers I\u2019ve worked\nwith.\u201d  He added he was reliable and trustworthy.  Tr. 95.  Applicant\u2019s wife testified\nby telephone and stated she had never seen or suspected that her husband was\ninvolved in any drug use since she has known him.  Tr. 110.  She denied any past\ndrug use.  Tr. 110-111.  She confirmed Applicant\u2019s version of how his interview was\nconducted in July 2004 by the DSS Special Agent, that being Applicant \u201cwas led to\nsay and write things that were not necessarily true, kind of coaxing him into saying\nthings that weren\u2019t his own thoughts.\u201d  Tr. 112.  Applicant\u2019s business partner\ntestified on his behalf and stated that he never had any suspicion that Applicant was\ninvolved in drug use since he knew him and that he was aware of his past drug use,\nbut was not sure of the dates involved.  Tr. 122-123.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an\nadministrative judge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining\nEligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d (Guideline[s]), which sets forth\nadjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions\n\n \u201cS u b sta n tia l e vid e n c e [is] su c h re le v an t e vid e n c e a s a  re a so n a b le  m in d  m ig ht a cc e p t a s\n7\nad eq ua te to  sup p o rt a c o nc lusio n in ligh t o f all the  co ntrary ev id e n c e  in the re co rd .\u201d  ISC R  C ase\nN o . 0 4 -1 1 4 6 3  at 2  (A p p .

Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these\nguidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nshould consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of\nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nthe final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive]\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision,\nI have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of\nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d  demonstrating, in\n7\naccordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the\nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the\nburden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and\n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Sep. 22, 2005).8\nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a\nfiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.\nThis relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty\nhours. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to\nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants\naccess to such information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail\nto protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual,\nrisk of compromise of such information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this\nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance,\nloyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nUnder Guideline \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1., \u201c[c]onduct involving . . . lack of candor [or]\ndishonesty . . . could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\u201d Of particular concern is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the clearance process. One personal conduct disqualifying conditions\nis particularly relevant this case. Guideline \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.2. provides, \u201c[t]he deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d  \nApplicant places the trier of fact in the unenviable position of trying to\ndetermine which version of his past drug use is true and accurate.  The security\nclearance application process requires the full, frank and consistent disclosure of\npast conduct \u2013 favorable and unfavorable.  Applicant offers the explanation that the\ntrue and accurate version past drug use is the more favorable one he provided in his\nOctober 2001 SF 86.  \n\n In  IS C R  C a se  N o . 0 4 -0 8 9 3 4  a t 2  (A p p .

Not only would he have one believe\nthe DSS Special Agent managed to coax or coerce him to provide unfavorable past\ndrug use about himself, but also about his father-in-law and brother-in-law and a\nrather qualified history of drug use involving his current wife.  In short, I do not find\nhis explanation credible and conclude his intent was to conceal the information about\nthe extent of his past drug use.  I accept his handwritten statement to the DSS\n9\nSpecial Agent on July 16, 2004, as the most credible description of his drug use.\nGuideline \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2. provides for seven Guideline E mitigating. \nconditions.  None of them are applicable in this case.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nGuideline \u00b6 E2.A10.1.1. articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning\ncriminal conduct stating, \u201c[a] history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d  One personal conduct\ndisqualifying conditions is particularly relevant this case. Guideline \u00b6 E2.A10.1.2.1.\nprovides, \u201c[a]llegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged.\u201d\nFor a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to occur, the falsification must be\nmaterial. The Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515\nU.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a statement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be]\ncapable of influencing, the decision making body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also\nUnited States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).   \nI conclude Applicant provided false information during the security clearance\napplication process.  His false statements about his drug use are material and violate\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  The discussion under Personal Conduct, supra, applies.\n  \nGuideline \u00b6 E2.A10.1.3.1. provides for six Guideline J mitigating \nconditions.  None of them are applicable in this case.\n \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to the facts discussed in the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, I have considered the general adjudicative Guideline related to the whole\nperson. As noted above, Applicant\u2019s failure to provide truthful, accurate and\nconsistent information as it pertained to his past drug use is sufficiently serious to\n\nS e e  IS C R  C a se  N o . 0 4 -0 6 2 4 2  a t 2  (A p p . B d . Ju n e  2 8 , 2 0 0 6 ). \n1 0\nraise a security concern. His actions with respect to personal and criminal conduct\nwere knowledgeable and voluntary. At the time he provided false information, he was\nsufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct.\n The motivation for Applicant\u2019s falsification is apparently to provide a more\nfavorable version of his past drug abuse and to obtain a security clearance.  Such\nfailure to be forthright and honest raises concerns about his integrity and as such is\nincompatible with access to classified information.  It casts doubt on his reliability\nand trustworthiness.  \nApplicant presented some extenuating and mitigating evidence.  He has\novercome substantial personal adversity following an unsuccessful suicide attempt and\nfelony conviction.  He was released from his probation for good behavior, although\nthis accomplishment is undermined by his apparent failure to comply with the terms of\nhis probation to remain drug free.  He went on to complete his education, got married,\nand is a conscientious spouse and parent.  He is accomplished in his profession and\nhad the mettle to start his own business.   \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to personal and criminal conduct. The\nevidence leaves me with doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability.  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d10\nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the\nAdjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the\nGuidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the\nreasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \n Paragraph 1, Guideline e:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.

While he does\nnot intend to use marijuana in the future, it is too soon to conclude that his drug involvement is\nsafely in the past. Clearance is denied.\n\nApplicant testified that his employer knew that by the time a security clearance was granted, it would no longer\n1\nbe needed (\u201crelevant\u201d) for that particular field test but that it was believed that similar situations were likely to come up\nin the future where he would need a clearance. (Tr. 46)\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on September 26, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (drug involvement)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,  and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on October 18, 2006, and elected\nto have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 4, 2006.\nWith the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing on March 1, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. One government exhibit (Ex. 1), and five Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-E), were admitted,\nand testimony was taken from Applicant, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 13,\n2007.\nThe record was held open until March 15, 2007, for Applicant to submit additional evidence\nof his work performance. On March 13, 2007, Applicant timely offered his performance review for\nthe period February 2003 to February 2004, along with a one-page letter from him. On March 16,\n2007, Department Counsel indicated the government had no objection. Accordingly, the letter and\nperformance review were marked collectively and admitted as Applicant Exhibit F.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H, Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from\nabout 1969 to at least October 2005. When he answered the SOR, Applicant admitted the use of\nmarijuana as alleged but none since October 2005. He expressed a willingness to swear an oath or\nsign a statement that he will not use marijuana in the future. After consideration of the pleadings,\nexhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old married father of two children born in August 1983 and July 1986.\nSince October 1998, he has been employed by a defense firm that designs and manufactures\nhazardous duty mobile robots utilized in explosive ordnance disposal and tactical law enforcement.\nInitially hired as a software engineer, he was promoted in November 2005 to the position of deputy\nmanager of a computer software group that sustains the software used on a man-portable robot.\nOn November 8, 2005, Applicant executed an electronic questionnaire for investigations\nprocessing (e-QIP) for a clearance needed at that time to read the final report of a field test of a robot\ndevice in Iraq.  He responded \u201cYes\u201d to question 24a concerning any illegal use of a controlled\n1\n\n3\nsubstance in the last 7 years, and indicated that he used marijuana from October 1995 to present\napproximately 10 times. A detailed history of Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana follows\nApplicant began smoking marijuana with his older siblings in 1969 in the family home. In\nhigh school, he continued to use marijuana with friends on the weekends only, no more frequent than\na couple of times per month. While attending a private college in his home state, his use of marijuana\nbecame more frequent. At times, he smoked the drug daily. Applicant also tried cocaine, used LSD\na handful of times, and ingested amphetamines once or twice as an undergraduate.\nAfter he earned his bachelor of science degree in mathematics, Applicant relocated to another\nstate to pursue a doctorate in computer science. His marijuana use continued on the order of once\nor twice weekly,  in the context of socializing with two different groups of friends in graduate\nschool. Applicant\u2019s spouse, whom he married in 1980, was aware of his illegal drug involvement.\nShe did not use marijuana herself but also did not have a problem with him using it.\nApplicant left graduate school in 1981 without finishing his degree to pursue full-time\nemployment. His marijuana use continued thereafter, but only when he got together with old friends\nwith whom he had smoked the drug previously. With familial and job obligations, his marijuana use\ndropped off to less than once per month.\nFrom about May 1984 to May 1986, Applicant pursued a master\u2019s degree in computer\nscience during the evenings while working a full-time job. By March 1988, Applicant had moved\nhis family back to his home state. By that time he had lost touch with two of his three closest friends\nwith whom he had used marijuana in graduate school. He continued to smoke the drug when he got\ntogether with the third friend (Mr. X), who provided him the marijuana.\nIn April 1998, Applicant and his family moved to his present state of residence where\nApplicant began working as a senior software engineer for a company that was acquired by his\npresent employer in October 1998. Applicant stayed in the job.\nAfter he moved, Applicant continued his friendship with Mr. X. Applicant smoked marijuana\nwhile visiting Mr. X back in his home state, usually in a cabin owned by Mr. X.  Applicant estimates\nhe smoked marijuana ten times with Mr. X between October 1995 and October 2005. Mr. X\nprovided the marijuana they used.  They were careful to not smoke the drug around their children\nbut did use it in their spouses\u2019 presence. Applicant was aware that marijuana use was illegal in his\nhome state. He attributes his willingness to risk possible criminal prosecution to a \u201cstreak of defiance\nleft over from when [he] was younger.\u201d\nApplicant has not used any marijuana since October 2005, as he decided to stop using\nmarijuana when he completed his clearance application. He had previously not given it a lot of\nthought. Applicant did not socialize with Mr. X in 2006.\nApplicant  believes alcohol causes more harm than marijuana, but understands it is a problem\nfor his security clearance. As to whether marijuana use may reflect negatively on a person\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with rules, regulations, he is of the opinion\nthat \u201cone should look beyond that individual factor.\u201d Applicant last visited with Mr. X in late\nJanuary/early February 2007. Applicant told his friend he was no longer interested in smoking\n\n4\nmarijuana (\u201cThat I was interested in the benefit of having a security clearance at work than in\nsmoking marijuana which really didn\u2019t mean a lot to [him] any more.\u201d).\nApplicant intends to socialize with Mr. X in the future. He considers it \u201cpossible\u201d that Mr.\nX will smoke marijuana in his presence in the future, but does not see any circumstances under\nwhich he will smoke the drug himself, citing the government\u2019s concerns, his waning interest, the\nrisks, and increasing concerns over the immorality of it. Applicant understands his employer has a\ndrug-free workplace policy, meaning that illegal drugs are not to be used on the premises and\nemployees are not to be under the influence while on the premises. A \u201chandful\u201d of his coworkers are\naware that he has used marijuana \u201cin the past.\u201d\nApplicant has been a good employee for the defense firm, especially in the technical side of\nthe business. He was instrumental in the development of the software for the man-portable product\nline, but his lack of planning and product integration skills has caused delays at times, especially\nduring 2003. Since November 2005, he has managed the software group that sustains and improves\nthe software on the man-portable robot product line. He has earned the respect of his software team\nand has shown himself willing to work long hours.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H\u2014Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises\n\n5\nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG\n\u00b6 24). Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include drugs, materials, and\nother chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens). (AG\n\u00b6 24(a)(1)). The use of a controlled substance such as marijuana is considered drug abuse under the\nDirective (\u00b6 24(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug). Drug involvement disqualifying\nconditions (DC) \u00b6 25(a) any drug abuse, and \u00b6 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) apply\nas Applicant smoked marijuana with varying frequency from about 1969 to October 2005. He\npurchased the drug in the past, although not since October 1995. Although not alleged in the SOR,\nApplicant also used LSD, and tried cocaine and amphetamines when he was in college.\nApplicant submits in his favor that he has been free of all illicit drugs since his last use in\nOctober 2005, and that when he completed his application for security clearance in November 2005,\nhe resolved to refrain from any future involvement. Although Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana has been\nlimited to about ten occasions since October 1995,  mitigating condition (MC) 26(a) the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment, does not apply given his involvement with marijuana throughout his teens and most of his\nadult life. A frequent user of marijuana (up to daily at times) as an undergraduate, Applicant did not\nleave his drug abusing past behind after he relocated for graduate school, married, and had two\nchildren. In graduate school, he found not one but two separate groups of friends with whom he used\nmarijuana. With one of these friends, he continued to smoke marijuana as recently as October 2005.\nClearly, he enjoyed the drug and was willing for many years to put his personal desires ahead of\nobeying the drug laws. A \u201cstreak of defiance left over from when [he] was younger\u201d (Tr. 55) does\nnot adequately excuse his behavior. \nA demonstrated intent to refrain from any future illicit drug use may yet mitigate the security\nconcerns presented by illegal drug abuse, although Applicant bears a heavy burden in this regard\ngiven his 26 years of involvement with marijuana. Under MC 26(b), among the factors that may\ndemonstrate that intent are:  (1) disassociation from drug using associates and contacts, (2) changing\nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4)\na signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. Applicant\nplans on continuing his association with his longtime friend from graduate school, who provided him\nwith the marijuana he used since October 1995. Applicant\u2019s present 16 months of abstinence is not\nlong enough to be considered \u201cappropriate,\u201d in light of the duration and extent of his abuse history.\nNor has Applicant signed a statement of intent to refrain from illegal drug use in the future (see\n26(b)(1)). However, he testified credibly to that effect under advisement of Title 18, Section 1001\nof the United States Code. Given Applicant\u2019s candor about his drug abuse history, I do not doubt the\nsincerity of his resolve to abstain. Yet, Applicant has also shown little understanding of the risk\npresented to that resolve by his ongoing association with Mr. X, who showed little reaction to\nApplicant\u2019s decision to give up illegal drug use. According to Applicant, when he told his friend in\nlate January/early February 2007 that he was \u201cmore interested in the benefit of having a security\nclearance at work than in smoking marijuana which really didn\u2019t meant a lot to [him] anymore,\u201d his\nfriend \u201cjust said oh.\u201d (Tr. 61). Applicant admitted that it is possible that this friend will smoke\nmarijuana in his presence in the future (Tr. 62), and that while his friend did not offer him marijuana\nduring their recent visit, Applicant was sure that this friend had some. (Tr. 65). It is too soon to\n\n6\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s abuse of marijuana is safely of the past. While he maintains that he is now\nconcerned with the moral issues surrounding the use of marijuana, he also considers it less harmful\nthan alcohol. (Tr. 54-55).\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a).\nApplicant\u2019s technical contributions to his employer have resulted in a product of value to the U.S.\nmilitary. Yet, his illegal drug abuse, especially while employed by a defense contractor and knowing\nof its illegality, (\u00b6 2(a)(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct) raises considerable doubts as\nto whether he possesses the good judgment and maturity that must be demanded of those with access\n(\u00b6 2(a)(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct). His reform is incomplete\nwhere he continues to associate with a known marijuana user (\u00b6 2(a)(6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes), even if they do not get together often.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On August 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 23, 2007. He answered \nthe SOR in writing through counsel on September 18, 2007, and requested a hearing \nMay 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nbefore an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on September 20, 2007. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 31, 2007, and I received the \ncase assignment on November 5, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November \n16, 2007, scheduling a hearing for December 20, 2007. The hearing was held as \nscheduled.  \n \nBefore the hearing commenced Department Counsel and Counsel for Applicant \nstipulated that the documents identified infra be admitted for my consideration. The \ngovernment offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 15, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through Q, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearings (Tr.) on January 4, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6 1.f., alleging, \u201cYou \nand your wife held Ukrainian security clearances which restricted your emigration from \nthe Ukraine.\u201d Tr. 84. After argument by both counsel, I denied Department Counsel\u2019s \nMotion to Amend. Tr. 84-86. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request (AE 3) that I take administrative \nnotice of certain facts relating to Israel and the Ukraine contained in AE 4 through 15. \nAs noted supra, these documents were included in counsels\u2019 stipulation. As requested \nand without objection, I took administrative notice of AE 3 through 15. Tr. 7-9. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) \n(listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to Israel \nwere derived from documents offered by Department Counsel under subheadings \n\u201cIsrael\u201d and \u201cUkraine\u201d of this decision. The facts administratively noticed are set out in \nthe Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n  \nIn his Answer to the SOR dated September 18, 2007 submitted through counsel, \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old systems staff engineer, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since February 2005. He was granted an interim secret security \nclearance in March 2005 and seeks a permanent clearance to enhance his \nopportunities within his company. Tr. 12, 49, 79-81. \n \nApplicant was born in 1945 in Russia, and was raised in the Ukraine, when both \ncountries were part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). He attended a \nfive-year college program in the Ukraine from August 1963 to June 1968, and was \nawarded \u201cthe qualification of Military Engineer in Radio-Technology,\u201d the equivalent of a \nmaster\u2019s degree. GE 1, AE M, Tr. 16, 73-74. Upon finishing his studies, he was \ncommissioned as a junior officer in the Soviet Army and served four years of mandatory \nmilitary service as a military engineer for radar systems. When discharged from the \nArmy in 1972, he went to work for a government-owned civilian research and \ndevelopment (R & D) institute located in the Ukraine as a systems engineer and later as \nsoftware programmer in embedded systems for military application. Tr. 17, 51. While \nworking for the R & D institute, he began and completed coursework for a Ph.D., but did \nnot complete his thesis. Tr. 11-12, Tr. 74. He left the R & D institute in 1993, and \nworked briefly as a programmer before he immigrated to the U.S., discussed infra. Tr. \n18. \n \nApplicant was married to his first wife from January 1969 to January 1982, which \nended by divorce. His marriage and divorce were in the Ukraine. GE 1. He has a 36-\nyear-old daughter from his first marriage. She is married and lives with her husband and \ntwo young children in the Ukraine. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) She is employed as an executive for a \ntelecommunications company. Her husband is an engineer for a communications \ncompany. Applicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-law both work for private companies. \nApplicant communicates with his daughter and her family in the Ukraine \u201c[m]aybe three, \nfour time(s) per year.\u201d Applicant stated he is not \u201cclose\u201d to his daughter because he and \nhis former wife divorced when she was 11 years old; he remarried and has a family with \nhis second wife, and he along with his second wife and two children live in the U.S., \ndiscussed infra. Applicant last saw his daughter living in the Ukraine during a visit there \nin September 2005. He recently started sending monetary gifts to his daughter and \ngrandchildren. GE 2, Tr. 15, 37-40, 56, 62, 65-66. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) None of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily members in the Ukraine work for or are associated with the Ukrainian \ngovernment.  \n \nApplicant married his second and current wife in February 1982 in the Ukraine. \nHe met her at the same R & D institute where he was employed. At the time he met her, \nshe had a young daughter from a previous marriage. After marrying his second wife, he \nadopted her daughter, who is now 32 years old and married. They also have a 22-year-\nold son born during their marriage. His second wife was born in Russia and their two \nchildren were born in the Ukraine. Tr. 13-14. \n \nWhile working at the R & D institute, he and his wife were required to have and \nmaintain a Soviet security clearance at the \u201cfirst level,\u201d or a \u201csecret clearance,\u201d which \nexpired some time after they left institute. Tr. 18, 21. As a former military officer and \n\n \n4 \n \n \nemployee of a Soviet owned R & D company, he was required to be a member of the \nCommunist party. He resigned from the Communist Party in 1989 because he decided \nhe wanted to \u201cfinish with this lie.\u201d He \u201cexpect[ed] some punishment\u201d for resigning from \nthe Party such as losing his job, but \u201cnothing happened.\u201d Tr. 47, 52-53. \n \nIn 1994, Applicant, his second wife, and two children from his second marriage, \nentered the U.S. State Department\u2019s Diversity Visa Lottery (Green Card Lottery), and in \n1995 were notified they had won the Lottery and were eligible to immigrate to the U.S. \nTr. 18-19. Applicant described this period as \u201cfinancially very hard.\u201d Tr. 19. Having won \nthe Green Card Lottery, he needed money to pay for the air fare to the U.S. for him and \nhis family. To earn air fare, he took a construction job in Israel for a three month period, \nwhere his elderly mother and younger brother were residing. They had already \nimmigrated to Israel from the Ukraine, discussed infra. Tr. 19. Having earned the air fare \nto pay for his family to fly to the U.S., Applicant returned to the Ukraine to make \narrangements for him and his family to immigrate to the U.S. Tr. 20, 71-73. \n \nWith visas in hand, Applicant and his family returned to the Ukraine to liquidate \ntheir assets, which included a city condominium and a country home. Notably, Applicant \nand his wife were forbidden to leave the Ukraine as a result of having held security \nclearances at the R & D Institute. Tr. 21. Applicant, his wife, and two children left the \nUkraine for Poland \u201cpretend[ing] to be tourists\u201d where they traveled in order to fly to the \nU.S. Tr. 21. They \u201cpretended\u201d to be tourists because it was \u201cno problem with American \nvisa\u201d and their Ukrainian passports to fly from Poland versus the Ukraine to the U.S. Tr. \n21. While pretending to be tourists, Applicant and his wife agreed that if they were \ndiscovered by the authorities leaving the Ukraine, they would split up and reunite at a \nlater time. Tr. 67-68. \n \nWhen Applicant was asked why he wanted to come to the U.S., he answered: \n \nFor some reason [it was a] dream for me and my family because . . . \nAmerica I believe is the best place in the world for [a] professional life, \n[and] for [a] private life . . . . I have some . . . experience . . . working three \nmonths in Israel, it\u2019s not so much [of a] pleasant place for people who do \nnot have \u2013 who do not have Jewish heritage . . my wife is a Ukrainian \nwoman . . . America is the best for . . . [many] reasons. Tr. 21. \n \nAsked how he felt about the U.S., he responded, \u201cI believe it\u2019s the best place in \nthe world.\u201d Tr. 48. \n \nApplicant and his family arrived in the U.S. in August 1996. Because of his \ninability to speak English proficiently, he took a job assembling billiard tables by day and \ndelivering newspapers at night. Beginning in February 1997, Applicant secured the first \nof several professional jobs related to his background and training, and as indicated \nsupra began his current job in February 2005. Tr. 22, 69-70, GE 1. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2002, and was issued his \nU.S. passport in October 2002. He never used his Ukrainian passport after arriving in \nthe U.S. He recently surrendered his Ukrainian passport to his Facility Security Officer, \nwho destroyed it. Tr. 28. Applicant presented evidence which states that a Ukrainian \ncitizen loses their citizenship if they voluntarily acquire citizenship of another state. Tr. \n29, AE C. Like Applicant, his wife and two children became naturalized U.S. citizens in \n2002. GE 1. \n \nApplicant\u2019s son is a college student finishing his last year of studies, and his \ndaughter is married with two young children. Tr. 70-71. Applicant and his wife are \ninvolved with and are close to their children and their family members in the U.S. \n \nApplicant stated that if he or any of his family members were ever approached or \nthreatened by a foreign agent to provide classified information, he would immediately \nreport such an overture to his security officer. Tr. 26-27. Applicant owns no property nor \ndoes he have any financial interests in the Ukraine or in Israel. He does not stand to \ninherit any property in Israel when his mother passes away. Tr. 42.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is $110,000.00 per year. He has two U.S. IRA accounts \nwith respective balances of $100,035.63, and $22,763.34. He also has two U.S. bank \naccounts with a combined approximate balance of $4,220.00. Tr. 43-46, AE H through \nK. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father served in the Russian Army in World War II. After the War, he \nwas employed as a chemical engineer program manager. He died in 1983. Tr. 30, GE \n1. Applicant\u2019s mother is 87 years old. She along with Applicant\u2019s younger brother\u2019s \nfamily immigrated to Israel from the Ukraine in 1992. They chose to leave the Ukraine \nbecause living conditions at the time were very poor. As a result of their Jewish \nheritage, they were allowed to immigrate to Israel and were granted Israeli citizenship. \nTr. 32-33, GE 1.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is retired, receives a pension from the Israeli government, and \nlives in Israel with Applicant\u2019s younger brother. Tr. 58-59. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b.) Applicant \nsends monetary gifts to his mother \u201csometime[s]\u201d on her birthday. In the past, Applicant \nspoke to his mother by telephone every other month, but more recently he began \ntelephoning her every month to check on her health. Tr. 32-33. Applicant does not \nconsider himself to be \u201cclose\u201d to his mother and stated she is closer to his younger \nbrother. He explained that he left home at age 18 and never returned whereas his \nbrother remained near his mother his entire life. For similar reasons, he does not \nconsider himself to be \u201cclose\u201d to his brother either. Tr. 34, 37, 77. \n \nHis younger brother is employed as an assembly worker for a medical equipment \ncompany in Israel. His brother is married with two adult daughters. Applicant speaks to \nhis brother by telephone \u201cmaybe five, six, seven time[s] per year,\u201d and exchanges e-\nmails with him \u201c[v]ery occasionally, maybe one per year for [his] birthday.\u201d Tr. 36. He \ntraveled to Israel in December 2002/January 2003 and again in January 2006 for his \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nmother\u2019s 85th birthday. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) Tr. 36, 59-60, 65, GE 2. None of Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers in Israel work for or are associated with the Israeli government.  \n \nApplicant votes in the U.S., pays taxes, has served on jury duty, and exercises all \nrights of U.S. citizenship. Tr. 49-50. \n \nApplicant submitted two annual performance evaluations for years 2005 and \n2006. Both evaluations document Applicant\u2019s sustained above average performance \nand evidence the fact Applicant is making a positive contribution to the defense \nindustry. Applicant\u2019s director of security submitted a signed declaration stating that \nApplicant \u201cis a very honest and trustworthy person\u201d and that \u201che would follow the rules if \nentrusted with classified material.\u201d Applicant\u2019s chief engineer for radar projects \nsubmitted a signed declaration stating the company \u201cnever had any problem with \n[Applicant\u2019s] handling of sensitive information\u201d and that he \u201c[h]e understands the rules \nfor this area and abides by them.\u201d Applicant\u2019s former engineering supervisor submitted \na signed declaration stating he \u201cwas always comfortable with [Applicant\u2019s] ability to \nsafeguard sensitive information,\u201d that Applicant \u201cdisplayed a high level of integrity,\u201d and \nhe found him to be \u201chonest and truthful.\u201d Applicant\u2019s chief systems engineer submitted a \nsigned declaration stating Applicant was \u201cvery careful about managing information\u201d and \nthat he \u201cnever had any reasons to doubt his honest[y], trustworthiness or integrity.\u201d AE L \nthrough Q. \nUkraine1 \n \n \nUkraine has a parliamentary system of government that has been independent of \nthe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics since August 24, 1991. The country is \nundergoing profound political and economic change as it moves from its Soviet past \ntoward a market economy and multi-party democracy. The first free election in the \nUkraine was held on December 1, 1991; however, international observers have \ncriticized aspects of later elections. In particular, the October 2004 presidential election \nwas characterized by government intimidation of the opposition and of the independent \nmedia, abuse of state administrative resources, highly skewed media coverage, and \nnumerous provocations. In the wake of massive demonstrations against the former \nregime\u2019s electoral fraud, Viktor Yushchenko became President in January 2005. \nSubsequent parliamentary and local elections in March 2006 were in line with \ninternational standards. \n \n \nThe Ukraine inherited a large military force from the Soviet Union, which is \nseeking to modernize in accordance with NATO standards. The Ukrainian government\u2019s \nforeign policy goals center on Euro-Atlantic integration, and it seeks entry into the World \nTrade Organization, the European Union, and NATO. At the same time, the government \nseeks to maintain good relations with Russia, however, that relationship is difficult and \ncomplex. For example, while President Yushchenko has called Russia a \u201cpermanent \nstrategic partner\u201d of Ukraine, relations with Russia have been troubled by energy \ndependence, the stationing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, and by \n \n1 The contents of the Ukraine and Israel sections are taken in whole or in part from GE 3 through \n15. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRussia cutting off natural gas supplies in January 2006. Ethnic Russians, concentrated \nin the southern and eastern parts of the Ukraine, make up 17.3% of the country\u2019s \npopulation. Ethnic Ukrainians in these regions tend to be Russian speaking, and are \nsuspicious of Ukrainian nationalism and support close ties with Russia. \n \n \nThe Department of State Report on Human Rights describes serious human \nrights abuses involving Ukrainian security forces and police. Specifically, the report lists \ntorture, wrongful confinement in psychiatric hospitals, and arbitrary and lengthy pretrial \ndetention. In addition to violent abuses, the Ukrainian government and its security \nforces illegally monitor private communications, harass minorities, and have arbitrarily \narrested and charged opposition politicians. The government, military, police forces, and \njudiciary are embroiled in \u201cserious corruption.\u201d  \n \nIsrael \n \n \nThe relationship between Israel and the United States is friendly and yet \ncomplex. Since 1948, the United States and Israel have developed a close friendship \nbased on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. U.S. - \nIsraeli bilateral relations are multidimensional. The United States is the principal \nproponent of the Arab-Israeli peace process, but U.S. and Israeli views differ on various \npeace process issues, such as the control of the Golan Heights, Jerusalem, and the \nWest Bank as well as expansion of Israeli settlements. The United States and Israel \nconcluded a free-trade agreement in 1985, and the United States is Israel\u2019s largest \ntrading partner.  Since 1976, Israel has been the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid.  \nThe two countries also have very close security relations. \n \n \nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy whose prime minister heads the government \nand exercises executive power. Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced \neconomy that is growing at about 5.2% per year. Almost half of Israel\u2019s exports are high \ntech and its major industrial sectors include high-technology electric and biomedical \nequipment. \n \n \nAccording to the Department of State Report on Human Rights, the Israeli \ngovernment generally respects the human rights of its citizens, but there are some \nissues with respect to treatment of Palestinian detainees, conditions in some detention \nand interrogation facilities, and discrimination against Israel\u2019s Arab citizens.  Terrorist \nsuicide bombings are a continued threat in Israel and the U.S. government has received \ninformation indicating that American interests could be the focus of terrorist attacks.  \nAmerican citizens have been urged to exercise a high degree of caution and common \nsense when visiting restaurants, businesses, and other places associated with U.S. \ninterests and/or located near U.S. official buildings. \n \n \nIsrael has given a high priority to gaining wide acceptance as a sovereign state \nand to ending hostilities with Arab forces.  To that end, the Israeli Defense Force has \nclose ties to the United States and in 1983; the two countries established a Joint \nPolitical Military Group which meets twice a year.  Israel and the United States \n\n \n8 \n \n \nparticipate in joint military planning and combined exercises, and have collaborated on \nmilitary research and weapons development.  Commitment to Israel\u2019s security and well \nbeing has been a cornerstone of U.S. policy in the Middle East since Israel\u2019s creation in \n1948, and the two countries are bound closely by historic and cultural ties as well as \nmutual interests. \n \n \nThere are several Issues of concern regarding U.S. relations with Israel.  These \ninclude Israel\u2019s military sales to China, inadequate Israeli protection of U.S. intellectual \nproperty, and espionage-related cases.  In November 1985, Jonathan Pollard (a civilian \nU.S. Naval intelligence employee), and his wife were charged with selling classified \ndocuments to Israel and Mr. Pollard was sentenced to life in prison.  Four Israeli officials \nalso were indicted, although the Israeli government claimed the espionage was a rogue \noperation.  On June 13, 2005, U.S. State Department analyst Lawrence Franklin was \nindicted for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information to a foreign diplomat.  \nHe later pled guilty and was sentenced to a 12-year prison term. It was reported that the \ndiplomat in question was a political counselor at the Israeli embassy. \n \n \nThe theft of sensitive and proprietary information threatens U.S. national security \nin both military and economic terms, and it reveals the intelligence-gathering capabilities \nof foreign governments and foreign companies. Industrial espionage is intelligence-\ngathering \u201cconducted by a foreign government or by a foreign company with direct \nassistance of a foreign government against a private U.S. company for the purpose of \nobtaining commercial secrets.\u201d Industrial espionage is not limited to targeting \ncommercial secrets of a merely civilian nature, but rather can include the targeting of \ncommercial secrets that have military applications, sensitive technology that can be \nused to harm the United States and its allies, and classified information. \n \n \nThe National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000 Report to Congress on Foreign \nEconomic Collection and Industrial Espionage lists Israel as one of the active collectors \nof proprietary information. The most recent Report, released in 2006, states that the \nmajor collectors have been repeatedly identified targeting multiple U.S. Government \norganizations since at least 1997. Furthermore, Israeli military officers have been \nimplicated in this type of technology collection in the United States. \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an \nadministrative judge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d (AG(s)). The AGs include brief \nintroductory explanations for each AG, and provide specific disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions. \n \nThese AGs are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these AGs in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An administrative \njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AGs \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information \nwill be resolved in favor of national security. AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 demonstrating, in accordance \nwith the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant \nto produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3 \n \n2 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n3\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is \nbecause of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to such \ninformation. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n  \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nIf the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontacts with his daughter in the Ukraine, and his mother and brother in Israel. At a \nminimum, these relationships carry a sense obligation with his relatives in Israel and the \nUkraine and create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation.  \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions primarily as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationship with his \ndaughter, mother and brother, and his travel to the Ukraine and Israel. The burden \nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. As previously \nindicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n \nTwo Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s daughter and family in the Ukraine and his \nmother and brother and family are not associated with or connected with the Ukrainian \nor Israeli governments, respectively.  \n \nAlthough Applicant testified he does not have a \u201cclose\u201d relationship with his \ndaughter and her family in the Ukraine or with his mother and brother\u2019s family in Israel, \nhe has significant ties to them, as evidenced by his frequent telephone calls, monetary \ngifts, and visits to the Ukraine and Israel. With regard to his daughter in the Ukraine and \n\n \n12 \n \n \nmother and brother in Israel, Applicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of [his daughter, mother and \nbrother] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts with his relatives in Israel \nand the Ukraine could potentially force him to choose between the United States and \nthose respective countries. On balance, he did not fully meet his burden of showing \nthere is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with his parents and siblings] could create a \nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. Applicant, his wife and two children have lived in the \nUnited States the last 12 years. He is completely vested in the U.S. Applicant, along \nwith his wife and two children became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2002. Applicant and \nhis wife are fully integrated in the U.S. Applicant has launched on a successful career in \nthe U.S. and is considered a valued employee by his employer. The same successful \nintegration in the U.S. applies to Applicant\u2019s wife and two children. His daughter is \nmarried and has two young children. His son is in his last year of college. Applicant \nsincerely professed his loyalty and allegiance to the U.S. The circumstances under \nwhich he left the Ukraine did not leave him much opportunity to return until 2005 when \nhe went there for his only visit since leaving in 1996. His association with Israel is \nsomewhat limited inasmuch as his mother and brother with his family immigrated there \nin 1992. His time spent in Israel is limited to a three-month period he worked there to \nearn the money to pay for air fare for him and his family to immigrate to the U.S. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and two children from his second marriage are naturalized U.S. \ncitizens. His closest living relatives are his wife, two children and their families, who all \nlive in the U.S. Appellant has developed a sufficient relationship and loyalty to the U.S., \nas he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nApplicant, his wife and two children became U.S. citizens in 2002.   \n \nApplicant has become the embodiment of achieving the American dream. The \nefforts and sacrifices he and his family made to immigrate to the U.S. are noteworthy. \nArriving in the U.S. in August 1996 and unable to speak proficient English, he took a job \nassembling pool tables by day and delivering newspapers by night. In February 1997, \nhe successfully secured a job consistent with his background and training and has \nworked in that field ever since. He and his wife put their children through college, are \nfinancially responsible, and are productive members of society. Applicant has been \nemployed by his defense contractor employer since February 2005 and is highly \nregarded at work. Applicant\u2019s contacts and linkage to the U.S. are substantially greater \nthan his linkage to Israel or the Ukraine. He is heavily vested in the U.S., financially and \nemotionally, and his connections to Israel and the Ukraine are very much attenuated by \nthe passage of time. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \n\n \n13 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d4 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the \neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.5 In addition to the \neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense \ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Israel and the Ukraine. He lived in Ukraine for a significant portion of his \nformative years and professional life. He was educated in the Ukraine, served in the \nSoviet military, and held a security clearance while employed at an R & D institute. His \ndaughter from his first marriage and her family are citizens and residents of the Ukraine. \nHis remaining immediate family members consisting of his mother, brother and his \nfamily immigrated to Israel from the Ukraine in 1992. He has frequent, non-casual \ncontact with his daughter living in the Ukraine and his mother and brother living in Israel. \nApplicant traveled to the Ukraine one time in 2005 and to Israel two times in 2002 and \n2006. He held a Ukrainian passport. However, he never used it since arriving in the U.S. \nin 1996 and recently surrendered it to his Facility Security Officer, who destroyed it. His \nUkrainian citizenship expired by operation of Ukrainian law when he became a U.S. \ncitizen in 2002. \n   \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for the past 11 years, and he has \nbeen a naturalized U.S. citizen for almost six years. He has strong ties to the U.S. His \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. \nAdams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n5 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the \neighth APF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. \nBd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for \nexploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n14 \n \n \nwife and two children from his second marriage reside in the U.S. Applicant\u2019s \nimmigration to the U.S. was not without challenges. After successfully winning the \nGreen Card Lottery, he went to Israel for three months to earn the air fare for him and \nhis family to travel to the U.S. Before leaving the Ukraine, they liquidated all of their \nassets; hence, having nothing to come back to if their plans to immigrate to the U.S. \nwere failed. Knowing they were not allowed to leave the Ukraine because they held \nsecurity clearances, Applicant and his wife and children posed as tourists to travel to \nPoland for the flight to the U.S. They decided in advance if one of them was discovered, \nthe other would continue on and meet later. \n \nOther than giving occasional gifts to his daughter and grandchildren in the \nUkraine, and his mother in Israel, he provides them no support as they are financially \nstable. Applicant and his family have fully integrated into the U.S. way of life. They are \nall U.S. citizens, his daughter is married and has two young children, and his son is in \ncollege. All of Applicant\u2019s financial holdings are in the U.S. He votes in U.S. elections \nand exercises all rights of U.S. citizenship. It was clear from his evidence and his \ndemeanor that he feels a strong sense of loyalty to the U.S. He is fully aware of the \nsecurity requirements and has proven to his superiors that he is trustworthy since being \ngranted an interim secret security clearance in March 2005. His ties to the United States \nare stronger than his ties to Israel of the Ukraine. He has no financial ties to Israel or the \nUkraine in contrast to his U.S. financial ties. There is no evidence he has ever taken any \naction which could cause potential harm to the United States.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer\u2019s confidence and trust in him is high so as to warrant \nrecommending him for a clearance. This was clearly demonstrated by various company \nofficials going on record in support of Applicant being granted a security clearance. \nApplicant takes his loyalty to the U.S. very seriously, and he has worked diligently for a \ndefense contractor for five years. His company officials assess him as loyal, trustworthy, \nconscientious, responsible, mature, and of high integrity. He enjoys a very good \nreputation as a friend, family member, employee and U.S. citizen. The individuals who \nsubmitted documentary evidence recommend him for a security clearance. No evidence \nwas presented recommending denial of his security clearance nor was any derogatory \ninformation submitted against him.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members in Israel and the Ukraine are not, and never have \nbeen, Israeli or Ukrainian agents. Israel is a highly developed, stable, democratic \nrepublic with a modern economy that has supported the U.S. war against terrorism. \nIsrael is a country that has been and continues to be friendly with the U.S. for more than \n50 years. The Ukraine has made substantial progress since becoming independent \nfrom the USSR in 1991. See country summaries under subheadings \u201cIsrael\u201d and \n\u201cUkraine.\u201d \n \nThis case must be adjudged on his own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This Analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that the Israeli or Ukrainian governments or its agents might \n\n \n15 \n \n \n                                                          \nexploit or attempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in such a way that \nthis U.S. citizen would have to choose between his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and \nthose family members.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d6 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.e.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nDecision \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.

On September 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn October 3, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR. On October 24, 2007, his \nanswer to the SOR was returned because it was incomplete. On November 29, 2007, \nApplicant submitted a complete answer to the SOR, and requested his case be decided \non the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) \non January 4, 2008.  The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on January 9, 2008. \nDepartment Counsel did not receive confirmation that Applicant received the FORM. On \nApril 9, 2008, Department Counsel contacted Applicant who confirmed he had received \nMay 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe FORM in January but did not submit matters or documents verifying proof of \nservice, and acceptance of the FORM. Upon further discussion, Department Counsel \ngave Applicant until April 16, 2008, to submit matters. Applicant submitted a response \non April 14, 2008. His response consisted of a one page letter from his payroll office, \ndated April 10, 2008. The document was admitted as AE 1 with no objection. The \nFORM was forwarded to the hearing office on April 14, 2008, and assigned to me on \nApril 23, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 29, 2007, Applicant admitted all of \nthe SOR allegations.   \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old aircraft mechanic employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking to maintain his security clearance.  He has been employed \nwith the defense contractor since April 2006. He served on active duty in the Air Force \nas an enlisted person from November 1984 to November 1987.  He is single and has no \nchildren. (Item 6.)   \n \nOn April 11, 2006, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86). A subsequent background investigation revealed the following \ndelinquent accounts: a $5,980 federal tax lien entered in August 2002 for delinquent \nincome taxes for tax year 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Item 7 at 4; Item 8 at 1; Item 10 at 3; Item \n12); and a $4,637 credit card account charged off in March 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Item 8 at \n1; Item 10 at 2.)   \n \nIn a signed, sworn statement, dated January 5, 2004, Applicant indicated that the \nlast time he remembers using the credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was in March 1997. \nHe stated: \u201cI believe after reaching my credit card limit, I stopped using it and paying on \nit. I was out of work when I returned and as a result needed the card to cover my basic \nliving expenses.\u201d (Item 11 at 2.) He acknowledged that he did not pay his taxes, and \nwas not sure what the process would be for him to be notified by the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS). He stated that he intends to contact his listed creditors and repay his \ndelinquent debts by the end of 2004. (Item 11 at 2.) \n \nIn a response to interrogatories, dated December 6, 2006, Applicant indicates \nthat payments to the IRS were taken out of his pay check at a previous job. He was \nsubsequently laid off and unable to afford the payments.  He noted that he needs to \ncontact the IRS in order to resolve the matter, and to provide the IRS with his current \naddress at an overseas location. He claims that he was unaware of the $4,637 charged \noff credit card account. He maintains the account was closed several years ago. (Item \n7.) \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, he states that the IRS levied his wages on September \n29, 2007, and maintains the credit card account was closed many years ago. (Item 5.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn April 14, 2008, Applicant submitted a response to the FORM. He provided a \ndocument which he claims provides proof that his IRS debt is settled. It is a signed \nstatement, dated April 10, 2008, from his company\u2019s payroll clerk, who also apparently \nacts as the Facility Security Officer, which states that his final payment on his IRS \ngarnishment was paid on December 26, 2007 and his debt is satisfied. (Item 13, AE 1.)  \nApplicant provided no documentation from the IRS indicating that his tax debt is \nresolved.  He provided no information on the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  \n \nApplicant had several periods of unemployment. His security questionnaire \nindicates that he was unemployed between November 2005 and April 2006, and \nbetween June 2001 to October 2002. (Gov 1.) Applicant provided no information about \nhis work performance or current financial situation.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n4 \n \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Although Applicant only has two \noutstanding delinquent accounts, the total balance is $10,617. Both accounts have been \ndelinquent since 2000.  This shows that Applicant has a history of not meeting financial \nobligations and also demonstrates an unwillingness to satisfy debts.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility goes back to the late 1990s. He did not \npay his 1999 federal income taxes. He ran up the credit card bill to the maximum in \n1997 without making payments. He presented no evidence that he paid the credit card \nbill. His long standing neglect of these two accounts casts doubt as to his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) should be considered due to Applicant\u2019s \nperiods of unemployment (June 2001 to October 2002; November 2005 to April 2006). \nHowever, in early January 2004, Applicant stated that he would pay the two delinquent \ndebts by the end of 2004. He was employed during the entire year of 2004. Presently, \nhe has worked full-time since April 2006. Although he claims the credit card account \nwas closed a long time ago, he does not indicate whether he made payments towards \nthis account. Any payments made to the IRS were the result of the IRS obtaining a \ngarnishment as opposed to being initiated by Applicant. While, he has had several \nperiods of unemployment, I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply.  There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling.  Insufficient proof was provided to verify that either debt was resolved. \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  The IRS apparently garnished his \nwages at a previous employer and apparently levied his wages at his current place of \nemployment. Applicant provided no garnishment paperwork to verify this. Although, \nApplicant provided a letter from his payroll clerk that his last payment towards the IRS \ngarnishment occurred in December 2007, it cannot be concluded that his IRS debt is \nsettled in full, absent some corroboration from the IRS. There is no evidence that \nApplicant made attempts to settle the delinquent credit card account. Passively waiting \nfor the statute of limitations to occur does not negate Applicant\u2019s history of financial \nirresponsibility. (see ISCR 03-20327 (App. Bd. October 26, 2006) citing ISCR Case 98-\n0349 (App. Bd. February 3, 1999). I cannot conclude that Applicant initiated a good-faith \neffort to resolve his overdue accounts.    \n \n \nUnder the revised AG, the overall concern under financial considerations is not \nonly whether a person who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds but also the failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligation to his creditors remains \na security concern. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has provided no \ninformation about his work performance or current financial situation. He is a mature \nadult. He was aware that he had two delinquent accounts to resolve since 2004 but took \nlittle action to resolve them. His negligent handling of his financial issues raises \nquestions about his reliability and trustworthiness and leaves me with doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The Applicant\u2019s mother, two sisters, a brother, and in-laws are citizens of and\nreside in Israel.  However, his wife, three children, and 12 grandchildren, are all American citizens\nand reside in the U.S.  His financial interests are also in the U.S.  The Applicant has lived in the U.S.\nfor over 40 years.  As the Applicant has \u201clongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\u201d it is\nunlikely that he \u201cwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of . . . [his\nforeign relatives] . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on October 30, 2006.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on January 19, 2007.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on January 19, 2007, and the case was heard on February 5, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary\nevidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on February 13, 2007.  The issues raised here are\nwhether the Applicant's perceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence militate against the\ngranting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the\nallegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 68 years of age, has a Ph.D. from an American university,\nand is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant\n(TR at page 24 line 3 to page 35 line 6).  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in\nthe record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nThe Applicant was born in Israel, but came to the U.S. 40 years ago to pursue a Masters\nDegree (TR at page 24 line 3 to page 25 line 2).  He stayed on in the U.S., and later pursued a Ph.D.\n(TR at page 25 lines 3~5).  The Applicant\u2019s wife, three children, and 12 grandchildren, are all U.S.\ncitizens and reside in the U.S. (TR at page 49 line 11 to page 50 line 16, and at page 51 line 23 to\npage 52 line 15).  His property and financial interests are also all in the U.S. (TR at page 49 lines\n\n3\n1~8, and at page 52 line 16 to page 53 line 12).\n1.a.~1.d., and 2.d.  The Applicant has initiated the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship, and\nhas surrendered his Israeli passport (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (TR at page 38 line 16 to page 39 line 21,\nand AppX) A at pages 1 and 2).  Before surrendering his Israeli passport, the Applicant traveled to\nIsrael to visit his parents about 18 or 19 times using his Israeli passport from about 1969~2006\n(Answer).  His father is now dead, and his mother, due to Alzheimer Disease, barely recognizes the\nApplicant; and as a result, his visits to Israel will be less frequent (Id, TR at page 40 lines 1~16, and\nat page 42 lines 7~16).\n\n4\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a.  The Applicant\u2019s mother, and two sisters are citizens of and reside in Israel (TR at page\n39 line 22 to page 40 line 16, and at page 43 line 12 to page 45 line 4).  The Applicant\u2019s mother is\n92 years of age; and as mentioned above, she suffers from dementia as a result of Alzheimer\u2019s\nDisease (TR at page 40 lines 4~12).  Because of her disease, he has little cognizant contact with his\nmother (Id).  She was seamstress (TR at page 43 lines 12~19).  One of the Applicant\u2019s sisters is a\nretired social worker, and the other is a \u201cself-employed as a psychotherapist\u201d (TR at page 44 lines\n1~24).\n2.b.  The Applicant\u2019s brother is also a citizen of and resides in Israel (TR at page 54 lines\n5~25, and at page 53 line 13 to page 54 line 5).  The Applicant has little to do with this brother, with\nwhom he cut all ties about 15 years ago (Id).\n2.c.  The Applicant has only occasional contact with his in-laws, who are citizens of and\nreside in Israel (TR at page 42 line 22 to page 43 line 10, and at page 47 line 15 to page 48 line 25).\nHis parents-in-law are elderly, and none of his in-laws have any connection with the Israeli\ngovernment (Id).\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy who\u2019s prime minister heads the government and\nexercises executive power.  Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced economy that is\ngrowing at about 5.2% per year, and the U.S. is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner.  Almost half of\nIsrael\u2019s exports are high tech and its major industrial sectors include high-technology electrical and\nbiomedical equipment.  The National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000 Report to Congress on\nForeign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage lists Israel as one of the active collectors of\nproprietary information.  The most recent Report, released in 2006, states that the major collectors\nremain active.  Israeli military officers have been implicated in this type of technology collection in\nthe U.S. (See the Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice at pages 1 and 4).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\n\n5\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to Foreign\nInfluence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a\nsecurity clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant, until recently, was a dual national with Israel, and maintained an Israeli\npassport.  The first disqualifying condition under Foreign Preference is therefore applicable as there\nwas an \"exercise of any right . . . of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . . .  This\nincludes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; . . .\"  This is countered,\nhowever, by the second and fifth mitigating conditions. \u201c[T]he individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d and \u201cthe passport has been . . . otherwise invalidated.\u201d\nHere, the Applicant has not only initiated the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship, but has also\nsurrendered his Israeli passport.\nThe Applicant's mother, and two sisters are citizens of and reside in Israel.  He also has\noccasional contact with his in-laws.  The first and second disqualifying conditions are arguably\napplicable as this contact \u201ccreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\" and creates \u201ca potential conflict of interests between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person . . . by providing that information.\u201d  Under the facts of this particular case,\nhowever, these are clearly countered by the first and second mitigating conditions.  The nature of the\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his Israeli relatives is \u201csuch that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of . . . [his family] and the interests\nof the U.S.\u201d  Also, the Applicant \u201chas such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the\nU.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  The totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable recommendation\nunder the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guidelines B and C are found for the\nApplicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nForeign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and\nof Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under\nGuidelines B and C.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Financial\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1a\u2013m with explanations. He denied \u00b6 1n. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, particularly Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 33-year-old information technology senior systems engineer working for a defense contractor. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology in 2002, and a master\u2019s degree in science in telecommunications and computers in 2006 (Tr. 103). He has been married twice. He married his first wife in KEYWORD: Personal Conduct DIGEST: From 1994 to 2004, Applicant was convicted of DUI, reckless driving, disorderly conduct, assault, assault on a pregnant woman, and public intoxication. He demonstrated lack of judgment, reliability, and maturity. Applicant\u2019s behavior was primarily alcohol related. In 2003, he began attending AA counseling, and has been sober since 2004. His extensive favorable evidence shows he changed his lifestyle and is on the path to rehabilitation.

He\ndemonstrated lack of judgment, reliability, and maturity. Applicant\u2019s behavior was\nprimarily alcohol related. In 2003, he began attending AA counseling, and has been\nsober since 2004. His extensive favorable evidence shows he changed his lifestyle\nand is on the path to rehabilitation. During the last three years, he has \nestablished himself as a mature, dependable, and reliable person who follows rules\nand regulations. He has mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 4, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns\nunder Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that based on\nthe available information, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary\naffirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him\naccess to classified information and submitted the case to an administrative judge for\na security determination.  On January 18, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and\n1\nrequested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on March 26, 2007. On April 5, 2007, with the\n \nconsent of the parties, I issued a hearing notice convening a hearing on April 26,\n2007. The hearing took place as scheduled. The government presented 10 exhibits,\nmarked GE 1-10, to support the SOR. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\npresented three witness and 10 exhibits, marked AE 1-10. DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) on June 8, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1a\u2013m with explanations. He\ndenied \u00b6 1n. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a\nthorough review of the evidence, particularly Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I\nmake the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 33-year-old information technology senior systems engineer\nworking for a defense contractor. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in information\ntechnology in 2002, and a master\u2019s degree in science in telecommunications and\ncomputers in 2006 (Tr. 103). He has been married twice. He married his first wife in\n\nKEYWORD: Personal Conduct\nDIGEST: From 1994 to 2004, Applicant was convicted of DUI, reckless driving, disorderly conduct,\nassault, assault on a pregnant woman, and public intoxication.

Applicant married his current wife in October\n2005. He has a 14-month-old daughter born of this marriage. \nIn March 2004, he began working for a defense subcontractor. In February\n2005, his current employer, the main defense contractor, hired Applicant as a\npermanent employee based on his outstanding performance. He has worked for his\ncurrent employer since February 2005 (Tr. 100-101) \nAfter graduating from high school in 1992, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He\nserved on active duty, attained the rank of specialist (pay grade E-4), and received\nan honorable discharge in August 1996 (Tr. 102). While in the Army, Applicant\nreceived four certificates of achievement and a military excellence award. The\nawards reflect favorably on his performance, dedication, and dependability. \nWhile in the Army, Applicant also was involved in three alcohol-related\nincidents. In 1994, he was involved in a bar fight and received nonjudicial\npunishment. He was required to attend alcohol counseling (Tr. 108-109). In May\n1996, he was convicted of assault at a state court. He had been consuming alcoholic\nbeverages before this incident and was involved in a fight with a neighbor because\nthe neighbor was talking to his wife (Tr. 193-194, GE 3).\nShortly after his discharge from the Army, he was involved in an alcohol-\nrelated fight. He was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. He received a\npre-trial diversion and was required to participate in counseling (GE 9). In January\n1997, he was involved in an alcohol-related altercation with his then girlfriend and\nassaulted her (Tr. 191-192).  He was arrested and charged with domestic\n2\n\n  G E  1 (security clearance ap p licatio n, sectio n 23 , da ted  A ugust 18 , 20 0 5 ).\n3\n  T he form was not available for review.\n4\nviolence/assault. His girlfriend refused to testify against him, and the charge was not\nprosecuted (GE 8). \nIn March 1997, Applicant was convicted for driving while under the influence\nof alcohol (DUI). His driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year, and he was\nrequired to attend alcohol safety action classes (GE 7). In August 1997, Applicant\nwas involved in another altercation with his then girlfriend who was pregnant. He\nwas charged with a second degree felony assault. He moved to another state, and\nfailed to appear in court. In November 1997, the court issued a fugitive from justice\nwarrant against him. Applicant voluntarily returned to the state\u2019s jurisdiction, and\npled guilty to assault on a pregnant woman. He stated he spit on her, and that she fell\nwhen he move out of the way when she tried to kick him.  He was placed on one-year\n3\nprobation and ordered to attend anger-management counseling. \nIn December 1997, Applicant and a friend visited a bar, became intoxicated,\nand were involved in a bar fight. He was found guilty of disorderly conduct and\nrequired to pay a fine (GE 2). In February 1999, Applicant was stopped by the police\nfor driving 20 miles over the speed limit under snowing conditions. He was found\nguilty of reckless driving (GE 1). The night before, Applicant had been drinking. He\nwas so drunk he slept in his car even though it was freezing. When he tried to drive\nhome in the morning, he was still under the influence of alcohol. The arresting\npolice officer failed to notice he was intoxicated (Tr. 179). Applicant testified that\nafter his license was suspended he continue to drive his car without a license. In\nOctober 2001, Applicant was arrested for public intoxication, and spent the night in\njail. He was later found guilty of the offense and paid a fine (GE 1).\nBetween November 1996 and January 2005, Applicant held 20 different jobs.\nHe left four of those jobs under questionable circumstances. In 1997, he was\nworking as a medical technician. The owner of the company reprimanded him for\ngoing out to buy breakfast and eating it at the job site after having punched the\nclock. Applicant argued with the owner and then walked off the job. In 1999, he was\nworking as a bartender at a restaurant and was involved in an argument with a\ncustomer. Applicant explained he complained to the owner, and not satisfied with\nthe way the owner handled the situation, he walked off his job.\nIn October 1999, Applicant was working as a bartender at a restaurant. He\naccused his boss of shorting his tip money and he was let go. In 2003, Applicant\napplied for a job with a government contractor. He completed a job application and a\ncompany background investigation form.  He failed to disclose his criminal record in\n4\nthe background investigation form.

Applicant\ndisclosed all his arrests, convictions, other runs-in with the law, and his questionable\nwork history. The employer reviewed the company\u2019s background form and compared\nit with Applicant\u2019s SF 86. Noticing the discrepancies, the company fired him for\nfalsifying the company\u2019s background form. Applicant denied any intent to falsify or\nmislead his employer (Tr. 147-148). He explained he believed the company\u2019s\nbackground form asked whether he had been convicted of any felony offenses (Tr.\n150). Because the SF 86 asked specific questions, he disclosed all of his criminal\nrecords and other information in detail.\nIn July 2005, Applicant received a letter of reprimand from his current\nemployer. He and a co-worker had an argument in the office, used profanity towards\neach other, and confronted each other in a threatening manner (Tr. 154). The\npresident of Applicant\u2019s company believes Applicant reacted positively to the\nreprimand and has continued to be a top-notch, highly valued employee. He has\nreceived excellent performance evaluations. The president of Applicant\u2019s company\nconsiders this was an isolated incident and not indicative of Applicant\u2019s overall\nbehavior (AE 10). He believes Applicant is trustworthy and reliable.\nApplicant submitted four additional character reference letters from the vice-\npresident of his company, a military supervisor, a company supervisor, and a co-\nworker. Some of them have known Applicant since February 2005; others have\nworked with and/or closely supervised him since January 2006. Applicant is a\nmature, responsible, reliable and trustworthy employee. Applicant\u2019s dedication,\nwork ethic, professionalism, and technical proficiency are notable. Moreover, since\nworking for his current employer, Applicant has had access to company sensitive and\nproprietary information. He has received extensive training in the handling of such\ninformation, and has had no security incidents. Applicant received the company\u2019s\nhighest rating for security awareness and compliance with security rules and\nregulations (AE 1, 8). \n\nApplicant believes that almost all his misconduct and work problems were\nalcohol related. He had his first alcoholic drink at age 14, and thereafter, he was\nhooked. During his sophomore and junior years in high school, his alcohol\nconsumption increased. He frequently drank to intoxication and began to experience\nalcohol-induced blackouts (Tr. 107). From 1997 to 2001, Applicant worked mostly\nas a bartender in different establishments, and consumed alcoholic beverages four to\nfive times a week (Tr. 110).  \nApplicant\u2019s best friend described him as an emotional, angry drunk, who\nsuffered personality changes as a result of his alcohol consumption. Applicant was\ndepressed and miserable, and obsessed with alcohol. In 2001, Applicant realized\nalcohol was taking control of his life. He stopped bartending and began his attempts\nto decrease alcohol consumption. He continued drinking because he had no control\nover his alcohol addiction (Tr. 110-113). He described himself as reckless, out of\ncontrol, disrespectful, violent, and with no regard for the possible consequences of\nhis actions (Tr. 123). Between 1997 and 2004, Applicant drove his car on numerous\noccasions under the influence of alcohol, and used illegal drugs (Tr. 180).\nIn February 2003, Applicant sought help and began attending Alcoholics\nAnonymous (AA). He obtained a sponsor and attended AA meetings regularly.\nBetween February 2003 and June 2004, Applicant experienced several relapses, but\nalways returned to AA. His last relapse was in June 2004, and was witnessed by his\nwife (then girlfriend) and his mother. According to Applicant, his wife, best friend,\nand his AA sponsor, Applicant has been sober since June 2004. He attributes his\nsuccess to his spiritual awakening, the counseling received at AA, his change of\nlifestyle, and his commitment to his family. \nApplicant attends AA meetings three to four times a week with his sponsor,\nand participates in other AA meetings on his own with two men he is sponsoring. He\nclaimed his obsession to consume alcoholic beverages is gone (Tr. 133), and that he\nhas not used any illegal drugs since 2004. Applicant no longer associates with his\ndrinking friends, has no alcoholic beverages at home, and avoids attending places\nwhere alcohol is being served. He credibly testified he is seriously committed to his\nwife and daughter and to remain sober.\nApplicant considers himself a recovering alcoholic. He believes his\nalcoholism is a manifestation of his personality; an extreme form of resentment,\nanger, fear, self-centeredness, and selfishness. He has learned to control these bad\ntraits through his spiritual awakening and following the 12 steps to sobriety he\nlearned and practices in AA. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisors, friends and neighbor\u2019s statements confirmed\nApplicant\u2019s change of lifestyle. They believe Applicant is now devoted to his wife\nand child. He is considered sociable, helpful, and a good man.

He is not identified as the father on the child\u2019s\nbirth certificate, and there is no legal document establishing he is the father or\nrequiring him to provide support.

Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I\n6\nconclude Guideline E (Personal Conduct) is the applicable relevant adjudicative\nguideline\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the initial burden of proving\n7\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must\nestablish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.  The responsibility then shifts\n8\nto the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of\npersuasion.  \n9\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.10\n\nKEYWORD: Personal Conduct\nDIGEST: From 1994 to 2004, Applicant was convicted of DUI, reckless driving, disorderly conduct,\nassault, assault on a pregnant woman, and public intoxication. He demonstrated lack of judgment,\nreliability, and maturity. Applicant\u2019s behavior was primarily alcohol related. In 2003, he began\nattending AA counseling, and has been sober since 2004. His extensive favorable evidence shows\nhe changed his lifestyle and is on the path to rehabilitation.

Clearance is granted.\nCASENO: 06-20182.h1\nDATE: 07/19/2007\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG & 15.\nApplicant admitted, and the government\u2019s evidence established, that from\n1994 to 2004, Applicant was involved in 10 different incidents of misconduct. He\nwas arrested and charged eight times for criminal misconduct; once for DUI; and\nonce for reckless driving. He was convicted of numerous offenses, including DUI,\nreckless driving, disorderly conduct, assault, assault on a pregnant woman, and\npublic intoxication. During that same period, Applicant used illegal drugs several\ntimes, and drove while under the influence of alcohol on numerous occasions.\nAdditionally, Applicant lost his job several times because of his disrespectful\nbehavior and disregard for rules and regulations. Disqualifying Conditions (DC)\n16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue related areas that\nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but\nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information,\napplies.\nAlmost all of Applicant\u2019s misconduct and questionable behavior, from 1994 to\n2004, was alcohol related, and occurred during a period when he was abusing\nalcohol. Applicant began his rehabilitation process in February 2003 by participating\nin AA. Initially, he failed and had several relapses; the last relapse was in June 2004.\n\n I S C R  C a s e  N o . 0 3 -0 4 1 4 7  at 3  (A p p . B d .

There is no evidence he has been\ninvolved in any alcohol-related incidents or other questionable behavior since June\n2004. Although I considered his 2005 office altercation with a co-worker, the\nevidence does not show the incident was alcohol related, nor did it rise to the level\nof questionable behavior Applicant displayed before 2004.\nApplicant has made significant lifestyle changes indicative of sobriety. He no\nlonger frequents places where alcohol is served, or associates with his old drinking\nfriends. Since 2004, he has been employed by a government contractor who rated his\njob performance as outstanding. Applicant has established a reputation as a top-\nnotch employee who is reliable and dependable. The president and vice-president of\nhis company consider him a valued employee. He has earned the trust and respect of\nfellow workers and supervisors for his technical proficiency and dedication. He\nreceived training in the handling of company sensitive and proprietary information\nand has handled such without a glitch. He has established a reputation for following\ncompany rules and procedures, and received high ratings from his military\nsupervisor for his security awareness.\nSince 2004, Applicant completed his master\u2019s degree, married his wife,\nbecame a father, and purchased a home. His friends, co-workers, and fellow AA\nmembers consider him trustworthy, loyal, and a devoted husband and father.\nMoreover, his AA sponsor and the two men Applicant sponsored into AA,\ncommented favorably about Applicant\u2019s commitment to sobriety and the positive\nimpact he has had on their lives. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s behavior in light of the general adjudicative\nguidelines related to the whole person concept under AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cUnder the whole\nperson concept, the Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in\nan applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must\nevaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of an\napplicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d  The directive lists nine adjudicative\n11\nprocess factors (factors) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. Additionally,\nother \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a).\nUltimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d AG\n\u00b6 2(c).\nApplicant\u2019s mitigating evidence weighs towards the grant of his security\nclearance.

His testimony was candid and forthcoming, never shy of disclosing the full\nextent of his questionable past behavior. He credibly testified he is cognizant of his\ndisease, and satisfactorily explained the efforts he has taken during the last three\nyears to remain sober and on the path to rehabilitation. Applicant has consistently\nand scrupulously participated in AA for the last three years, and although not\n\u201ccured,\u201d he has changed his lifestyle and taken positive steps to remain sober. \nHis witnesses and character references corroborated Applicant\u2019s testimony.\nThey show Applicant has turned his life around, and during the last three years has\nestablished his reputation as a trustworthy, dependable, and reliable person.\nMoreover, his behavior at work shows that he now follows rules and regulations and\nmaintains high security awareness.\nBecause Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior was primarily alcohol related, I\nfind that his three years of sobriety, considered in conjunction with Applicant\u2019s\nextensive favorable evidence, mitigate his past behavior.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDonald L. Schense, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 6, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 31, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings are\nbased upon substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had failed to timely file federal income tax returns for the\nyears 1999 through 2004.  As a result, he had incurred a tax debt, including late fees and penalties,\nof approximately $63,954.  Decision at 3-4.  Additionally, the Judge found that Applicant had\ndeliberately falsified his security clearance application (SCA) when in response to the questions as\nto whether he had debts that had been delinquent over 90 days and over 180 days respectively, he\nanswered \u201cno.\u201d  In reaching that conclusion, the Judge noted: \u201cIt is likely that Applicant was aware\nthat his tax debts would be an issue based on his 30 year history of holding a security clearance.\u201d\nDecision at 8-9.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe Board has examined the Judge\u2019s decision and concludes that her material findings are\nsupported by substantial record evidence.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant knowingly\nprovided false information on his SCA is sustainable.  The Judge weighed the evidence supplied by\nApplicant and considered the application of relevant mitigating conditions, finding in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor on some of the Guideline F security concerns.   Nevertheless, the record supports the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security for him to have a security clearance.  Accordingly, the Board holds that\nthe Judge\u2019s adverse decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED. \n \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

On November 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct for Applicant. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 29, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nJanuary 23, 2007. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on January \n26, 2007. On January 31, 2007, the case was delayed indefinitely due to Applicant\u2019s \nserious health problems.  On May 14, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling \nthe hearing for June 12, 2007. On June 8, 2007, the hearing was cancelled due to \nApplicant\u2019s continuing serious health problems. The administrative judge continued the \nJanuary 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncase indefinitely until Applicant\u2019s health improved.  The case was transferred to me on \nJune 14, 2007.  Applicant indicated he was healthy enough to attend a hearing in \nNovember 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 16, 2007, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on December 19, 2007. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, \nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) \non January 4, 2008. The record was held open until January 3, 2008, to allow Applicant \nthe opportunity to submit additional matters. Applicant timely submitted AE C, which \nwas admitted. The record closed on January 3, 2008. Based upon a review of the case \nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old resource analyst employed by a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nmathematics and a master\u2019s degree in industrial engineering and operations research. \n(Tr at 50.) He needs six more credits to complete a master\u2019s degree in statistics. His \nareas of expertise are mathematics, statistics, and operations research. (Tr at 73.) \n \nFrom approximately 1967 to 1977, Applicant worked as a statistician for the \nUnited States Navy.  In 1977, he accepted a job with the Air Force to work in operations \nresearch. He retired from federal civilian employment in 1992 at the level of GS-15. He \nworked for a contractor for a year and half.  In October 1994, he accepted a job as the \nhead statistician of a state government agency in another state. His pay was the \nequivalent of a GS-15. In October 2004, he retired from the state agency. He started \nworking for his current employer in November 2004. (Tr at 50-54, 58; Gov 1.) He held a \nsecurity clearance from 1967 to 1994. He never had a security incident while handling \nclassified information. (Tr at 67.)  \n \nApplicant is currently married. He has been married to his wife for 37 years but \nthey have been separated since 1996. They have two adult sons. Applicant lives with \nhis girlfriend. He met her when he was working for the state agency. His girlfriend \nmoved with him back to the state where his current employer is located. Applicant \nsupports his wife and his girlfriend. Neither work. He pays his wife\u2019s mortgage payment \nand provides her $1,000 a month. His girlfriend has been his caregiver for the past year. \nApplicant anticipates that he will file for divorce within the next year. (Tr at 71-72.) \n \nOver the past ten years, Applicant encountered significant health issues.  In \n1998, he was diagnosed with kidney failure. From 1998 through 2001, he was on \ndialysis. In March 2001, he lost his lower left leg due to complications from diabetes. In \nOctober 2001, he received a kidney transplant. Between 2001 and 2003, he had two \nstents put in. Shortly after he retired from the state in 2004, his kidney transplant failed. \nHe has been off and on dialysis since 2005. On July 4, 2006, he had a stroke and was \nhospitalized for awhile. He has difficulty with lightheadedness and balance. He has \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncongestive heart failure. In January 2007, he had quadruple by-pass surgery. He was \nhospitalized for three months. Since leaving the hospital, he has recuperated in two \nnursing homes. He is currently on long term disability with his employer but works on \nunclassified projects at home. (Tr at 56-58.) \n \nDue to his health issues, Applicant did not work for approximately seven months \nin 2001. In 2002-2003, he worked three quarters to full-time. In 2004, he was \nhospitalized for two months, and was unable to work off and on due to health issues.  \nHe was also on sick leave sporadically between 1998 to 2000. (Tr at 84-86.)  \n \nWhen Applicant filled out his security clearance application on October 29, 2004, \nhe answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 38 which reads: \u201cYour Financial Delinquencies \u2013 180 \nDays. In the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d He also answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 39 which reads: \u201cYour \nFinancial Delinquencies \u2013 90 Days. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d Question 43 allows an applicant to list additional general remarks. Applicant \ndid not list anything in the general remarks section. In signing the application, Applicant \ncertified his statements were true, complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge \nand belief and made in good faith. He also acknowledged that a knowing and willful \nfalse statement on the form could be punished under federal law. (Gov 1.)  \n \nOn April 18, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a USIS investigator in \nconjunction with his background investigation.  The USIS investigator testified that she \nwent through Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SF 86) with him \u201cline by line.\u201d \nThe USIS investigator asked Applicant if his answers to questions 38 and 39 were \naccurate. He confirmed that the answers were correct. She did not specifically ask him \nabout taxes.  The USIS investigator asked Applicant seven concluding questions. The \nquestions include, \u201cIs there anything pertinent to the investigation or anything else that \nyou would simply want me to know?\u201d; \u201cIs there any reason for anyone to question your \nhonesty and integrity?\u201d; and \u201cAre there any reports that will be reviewed in the course of \nthe investigation or persons interviewed that would contradict anything said or provided \nin the interview today?\u201d He answered \u201cNo\u201d to all of those questions. (Tr at 23-26; Gov \n4.)  \n \nIn approximately late April 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife was interviewed during the \ncourse of the investigation. She mentioned that in 2005 she had been contacted by a \nstate Department of Revenue related to delinquent state income taxes. When she \ncontacted Applicant about the phone call, he admitted that they were late on state and \nfederal income taxes.  Although they were separated, they still filed joint income tax \nreturns. Based on this information, the USIS investigator contacted Applicant to have \nhim sign a release for his Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.) records. On May 2, 2006, \nhe signed the release but they did not discuss his taxes at that time. (Tr at 27-29.) \n \nUpon contacting the I.R.S., it was discovered that Applicant owed past due taxes \nfor tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.j.)  He did not file \nhis 1999 income tax return until April 22, 2006.  He did not file his 2000, 2001, 2002, \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2003 and 2004 income tax returns until December 14, 2005. For 1999, his adjusted \ngross income was $82,764 and his taxable income was $62,214. For 2000, his adjusted \ngross income was $84,626 and his taxable income was $63,722. For 2001, his adjusted \ngross income was $86,944 and his taxable income was $64,410. For 2002, his adjusted \ngross income was $97,337 and his taxable income was $69,171. For 2003, his adjusted \ngross income was $101,054 and his taxable income was $79,542. For 2004, his \nadjusted gross income was $107,178 and his taxable income was $86,514. (Gov 5.)  He \nowed taxes for each year. The total amount of the tax debt, including late fees and \npenalties was approximately $63,954. The USIS investigator did not re-interview \nApplicant about his tax debts. (Tr at 29-31, 76; Gov 5; AE A.)  \n \nApplicant was aware that he had an obligation to file his federal tax returns. (Tr at \n81-82.) He did not file the returns partially due to health issues. He got behind the first \ncouple years and procrastinated. He was not well during this time period, even though \nhe knows it is not a good excuse. (Tr at 83.) In his answer to the SOR, he states that he \ndid not expect to owe any taxes because he had received a refund in 1998. (Answer to \nSOR.)   \n \nAt hearing, Applicant was asked whether he filed his state income tax returns \nduring the years he did not file federal income tax returns, ie. 1999-2004. He \nresponded, \u201cYes, because I was a state worker. I thought I should.\u201d (Tr at 79.) He \nrecalls his wife contacting him about the overdue taxes in 2005. (Tr at 80.) Shortly after, \nhis son helped him prepare his tax returns. (Tr at 81).  \n \nApplicant testified that he did not realize that he had debts that were over 90 to \n180 days delinquent when he filled out his security clearance application. (Tr at 59-60, \n87.) Although he had not filed his income tax returns for tax years 1999 to 2003, he \nassumed he did not owe any taxes. He was not aware of the other delinquent debts.  \n(Tr at 87.)  \n \nDuring his April 2006, interview with the USIS investigator, Applicant admits he \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d when she asked him whether he was more than 90 days and 180 days \ndelinquent on any debts. He did not think he was delinquent on any debts. Under cross \nexamination, he admits that he knew that he owed the I.R.S. for delinquent taxes, \nhaving filed his tax returns in December 2005. He initially claimed that he did not know \nwhat the delinquency was because they were filed after the interview with the USIS \ninvestigator.  When reminded by the Government counsel that he was interviewed by \nthe USIS investigator four months after filing his taxes, he explained that because he \nhad filed his taxes, he thought he had taken care of the debt. He did not think of \ndelinquent tax debts in the same fashion as delinquent bills. (Tr at 88-90.) When asked \nabout his filing his 1999 federal income tax return four days after the interview with the \nUSIS investigator, Applicant claimed he did not remember. (Tr at 90.)    \n \nCredit reports obtained during the investigation revealed the following delinquent \ndebts: a $276 medical bill turned over for collection (SOR \u00b61.a); a $125 collection \naccount (SOR \u00b61.b); a $346 department store account that was 180 days delinquent as \n\n \n5 \n \n \nof March 2006; and a $792 credit account that was 120 days delinquent in June 2006. \n(Gov 2; Gov 3; Gov 6.)  Applicant claims that he paid off all four debts by July or August \n2006. (Tr at 61.) He provided proof that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c (Gov 6 at 3; AE \nB at 2), and 1.d (Gov 6 at  2; AE B at 2) were paid.  Credit Reports dated May 24, 2007, \nand December 6, 2007, indicate that Applicant has approximately nine additional \ncollection accounts related to medical bills. (Gov 6 at 2; AE B at 2.) During cross \nexamination, Applicant admitted that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.a was not paid. He \nthought that it was paid but is now working to track down the creditor. (Tr at 74-75.)   \n \nApplicant and his wife refinanced the mortgage on their home in order to pay off \nthe federal tax debt.  On October 4, 2006, Applicant paid $63,954.76 to the I.R.S. which \nresolved the federal tax debt. (Tr at 64-66, 77; AE A.) He is actively working with the \ncollection agency and the hospital to resolve the medical accounts. He has \napproximately $3,500 in unresolved medical bills. (Tr at 62-63.) Aside from the medical \naccounts, his current financial situation is stable. (Tr at 70.) After deductions, Applicant \nreceives $1,500 per month from his federal government pension. He receives $900 per \nmonth from his state government pension. (Tr at 74.)  \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted four character references.  The president \nand CEO of the defense contractor Applicant works for has known Applicant for ten \nyears and states he is \u201ctotally responsible and diligent in all matters of holding and \nmaintaining a Top Secret clearance.\u201d He states that Applicant has been an exemplary \nemployee whom he places great responsibility and trust. (AE C at 2.)  The Director of \nBusiness and Marketing has known Applicant since 1983.  He indicates that Applicant is \na personal friend who is held in very high regard by his contemporaries. He plays a \nvaluable role with the company and should be granted a security clearance. (AE C at 3.) \nThe Assistant Facility Officer has known Applicant since 1990.  He has always found \nApplicant to be an honest, trustworthy and forthright individual. He recommends \nApplicant for a clearance. (AE C at 4.)  The Team Manager of the Missile Warning \nTeam states that Applicant is a key member of his team.  The ability to use Applicant\u2019s \nexpertise would greatly accelerate the team\u2019s efforts.  Applicant is a dependable \nmember of the team and the team manager does not believe that he presents a risk if \nhe is allowed to resume his work with classified information. (AE C at 5.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n7 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC & 19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. He incurred several delinquent debts \nover the years to include a significant federal tax debt for tax years 1999 \u2013 2004.  \n \nFC DC \u00b619(f) (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same) applies. Applicant admits to not timely filing \nhis federal income tax returns for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. \nHe failed to provide a sufficient excuse for not doing so. He testified that he filed his \nstate tax returns during these years because he thought he had an obligation as a state \nemployee.  He did not fully explain why he felt no obligation to timely file and pay his \nfederal income tax returns. \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. The \nmain concern in Applicant\u2019s case is his deliberate failure to timely file and pay his \nfederal income tax returns.  He did not file federal income tax returns over a six year \nperiod.  He did not take steps to file his federal income tax returns until December 2005, \none year after submitting his application for a security clearance. While Applicant paid \noff the tax debts in full in October 2006, concerns remain due to the significant period in \nwhich Applicant failed to file and pay his tax debts.  It appears that his motivation for \nresolving his tax debts was in order to obtain a security clearance. His actions raise \ndoubts about his judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, with respect to the non tax-\nrelated delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Many of the new debts are medical \naccounts which Applicant is actively working to resolve. His health problems have had \nsome affect on his financial condition. However, his annual income increased each \nyear. His medical absences did not reduce his income. As such FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given \nless weight.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.  Applicant refinanced his home in order to \nresolve the tax debts and several delinquent debts. While, he could have resolved these \ndebts earlier by filing and paying his federal income taxes in a timely manner, he did \nresolve the tax debt. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAdmittedly, Applicant\u2019s health is a significant mitigating factor pertaining to the \nnon tax-related debts. However, Applicant deliberately did not file his federal tax returns \nbetween 1999 to 2004.  He did not take action to file and resolve his federal tax debt \nuntil after being hired by the defense contractor and reapplying for a security clearance. \nSecurity concerns remain under financial considerations based on Applicant\u2019s poor \njudgment regarding his federal income taxes. The financial considerations concern is \nnot mitigated.  \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern under personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nThe government established a prima facie case that Applicant deliberately \nfalsified his security clearance application, signed by Applicant on October 29, 2004, \nwhen he answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 38 and question 39. Although Applicant \nclaims he believed that he did not owe the federal government for taxes, he was aware \nthat he failed to file federal income taxes for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and \n2003. His explanation that he did not consider taxes owed to be debts lacks credibility.  \nApplicant is an intelligent and well-educated man who has a 30-year history as a \nstatistician.  It is implausible to conclude that he believed that he would owe nothing for \ntax years 1999-2003.  \n \n \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b616(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies to Applicant\u2019s \nomission of his delinquent tax debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.h) on his security clearance \napplication. \n \n \nPC DC \u00b616(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, \nor other official government representative) applies to Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to \ndisclose his federal tax debts to the USIS investigator during the April 18, 2006, \ninterview. On December 14, 2005, Applicant filed his federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  Upon filing his tax returns, he should have \nbeen aware that he owed the I.R.S. over $51,000 in past due taxes.  Yet, when asked \nabout delinquent debts over 90 or 180 days old, he told the investigator no.  At no time \nduring the interview, did he bring up the subject of taxes owed, even though he filed the \n\n \n9 \n \n \ntax returns four months prior to the interview.  In addition, Applicant did not file his \nfederal income tax return for 1999, until April 22, 2005, four days after his interview with \nthe USIS investigator. The information provided to the USIS investigator was, at the \nvery least, deliberately misleading. Applicant\u2019s significant tax debts were relevant to his \nsecurity clearance background investigation. It is likely that Applicant was aware that his \ntax debts would be an issue based on his 30 year history of holding a security \nclearance. \n \n \nNone of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case.  PC MC 17(a) (the individual made a prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with other \nfacts) does not apply.  There is no evidence Applicant attempted to contact the USIS \ninvestigator to provide information about his delinquent tax debts. His first admission to \nhaving delinquent tax debt was in response to the SOR.  \n \n \nPC MC 17(b) (the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized \npersonnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual to specifically \nconcerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the failure to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully) does \nnot apply. There is no issue as to Applicant receiving improper or inadequate advice \nfrom authorized personnel or legal counsel during the security clearance process.  \nAlthough he signed an I.R.S. release a few days after he was interviewed, he was not \nforthcoming about his I.R.S. debts with the USIS investigator when she obtained the \nrelease.  \n \n \nPC MC 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) does not apply. Deliberately providing false information on a security \nclearance application and to an investigator conducting the subsequent background \ninvestigation are serious offenses.  Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications are recent and \nraise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.  \n \n \nThe remaining personal conduct mitigating conditions are not applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s case. Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Personal \nConduct pertaining to his deliberate falsifications during his background investigation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n10 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s 30 year \nhistory of holding a security clearance as well as the highly favorable recommendations \nof his co-workers and superiors. I considered his health issues and his attempts at \nresolving his delinquent debts. Questions about his judgment and reliability remain \npertaining to his deliberate failure to file his federal income tax returns over an extended \nperiod of time. While Applicant has suffered from serious health problems over the past \nten years, timely filing his federal income tax returns were within his control. His last \nminute resolution of his tax debt does not mitigate this concern. Nor does it mitigate \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate attempt to withhold information pertaining to his delinquent tax \ndebts on his security clearance application or during his background interview.  \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s cohabitation with another woman while still \nmarried to his wife raises additional questions about his judgment.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility  \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph  1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph  1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant answered the SOR 14 November 2007, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 10 January 2008, and I convened a hearing 13\nFebruary 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 22 February 2008.\n \nFebruary 29, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. and 1.h. Accordingly, I incorporate his\nadmissions as findings of fact. He denied SOR allegations 1.b. through 1.g. He is a 53-\nyear-old linguist employed by defense contractors since March 2003. He seeks to retain\nthe security clearance he obtained in March 2003.\nApplicant was born in Afghanistan in March 1954. He immigrated to the U.S. in\nFebruary 1977, became a legal permanent resident (LPR), and was naturalized as a\nU.S. citizen in January 1984. He obtained his most recent U.S. passport in December\n2004. Applicant\u2019s wife, who he married in October 1988, is an LPR of the U.S. She is\neligible for her U.S. citizenship, but she failed the language portion of the citizenship test\nand is applying to retake it. Applicant and his wife have five children, all native-born U.S.\ncitizens. They all reside in the U.S. Applicant owns his home in the U.S. and all his\nfinancial interests are here.\nApplicant\u2019s siblings include a brother, sister, and half brother. His brother is a\nresident citizen of Afghanistan, employed as a farmer. His sister is a dual citizen of\nAfghanistan and Germany, residing with her husband in Germany. His half-brother is a\ncitizen of Afghanistan, permanently residing in Australia. \nApplicant\u2019s wife has a number of siblings and step-siblings who are resident\ncitizens of Afghanistan. Except for one brother who recently retired as a construction\nsupervisor for the Interior Ministry, none of these siblings has any connection to the\nAfghan government. In addition, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his siblings-in-law are limited,\nas are his contacts with his own siblings. Applicant also has a casual friendship with a\nPakistani doctor who he met about 10 years ago. They have visited 4-5 times in those\n10 years, but not since September 2005.\nBetween March 2003 and July 2005, Applicant was deployed to Afghanistan as a\ncontract linguist in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). During most of that\ntime, he worked as a political advisor, interpreter, and translator for a Provincial\nReconstruction Team (PRT), and was designated the lead linguist in the PRT. He also\nworked in the field in direct support of Army operations in dangerous situations. Put\nbluntly, he is one of the entry points for the classified intelligence that comes to U.S.\nforces from Iraqi insurgents and informants. He has been uniformly praised by his\nemployer, his senior civilian supervisors, and his Army supervisors (senior officers and\njunior officers alike) for his patriotism, his personal bravery in \u201cred zones,\u201d the quality of\nhis translations and interpretations in Pashto, Farsi, and several other languages, and\nthe cultural nuances that he is able to bring to interrogations. His cultural knowledge\nand skill at putting informants at ease increases the likelihood that he will obtain\naccurate information (G.E. 2).\nApplicant\u2019s current job requires him to recruit other linguists for deployment to\nAfghanistan. His co-worker considers him honest and trustworthy, as do his friend and\nneighbor.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nAfghanistan is an Islamic Republic and emerging democracy. With the support of\nthe U.S. and other nations, the new government endeavors to build a new system of\ngovernment and to rebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure. The Army and police force are\nwell trained. The government continues to face significant challenges from insurgents\nand terrorist organizations supported by the ousted Taliban as well as Al Qa\u2019ida, but\nactively seeks to eliminate both with the assistance of the U.S. and NATO. The new\ngovernment is also working to reverse a long legacy of serious human rights abuses,\nbut serious problems remain. Afghanistan is now an active member of the international\ncommunity and has signed a \u201cGood Neighbor\u201d declaration with six nations bordering it\nand promotes regional cooperation. The U.S. supports the emergence of a broad-based\ngovernment in Afghanistan. Afghanistan continues to seek U.S. support as it moves\nforward towards democracy and stability. It is not known to be an active collector of\nintelligence information.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\n4\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n3\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.4\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under\nGuideline B. Considering first the country involved, Afghanistan and the U.S. enjoy good\nforeign relations. It has not been demonstrated that the Afghan government is actively\nengaged in the collection of U.S. intelligence such that would make Applicant or his\nfamily likely targets for coercion, duress, or influence. The government\u2019s evidence\nexplains the links to terrorism that are on-going in Afghanistan and the way that those\nterrorist organizations operate, the increase in terrorism, and the increase in\nmembership in terrorist groups. Several of the groups that are frequently in the news,\nfor example the Taliban and Al Qa\u2019ida, operate in Afghanistan and practice terrorist acts\nagainst Afghanis and against U.S. forces as well as indiscriminate violence in order to\ndraw attention to themselves and increase their membership and their power. There is\nno indication they use terrorism to gain access to U.S. information.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced no evidence\nthat there was a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion because of Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in Afghanistan.\nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members have any direct connection to the Afghan\ngovernment, and there is nothing in the past connections of his brother-in-law (now\nretired) or other siblings-in-law to raise a concern over protecting classified information.\nFurther, Applicant has been in the U.S. more than 30 years.

Her financial problems\ncorresponded with the breakdown of a volatile domestic relationship. Since then, she has remarried,\npurchased a home, initiated a good-faith dispute regarding the deficiency balance remaining from\nthe repossession, satisfied one of the credit card delinquencies, and has been attempting to contact\nthe remaining creditor since July 2006. She has alleviated the trustworthiness concern, and eligibility\nto occupy a sensitive position is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 7, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January\n2, 1992, as amended. (Directive).\nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that\nit was clearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for occupying a sensitive position in support of a contract with the Department of Defense,\nand recommended a referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should\nbe granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Applicant answered the SOR on January 12, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 7, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March\n28, 2007, scheduling the case for April 19, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled.\nDuring the hearing, I received four government exhibits, four Applicant exhibits, and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. At the hearing\u2019s conclusion,  I left the record open to allow Applicant to\nsubmit additional exhibits. Subsequently, she submitted six additional exhibits which I marked and\nreceived as Applicant\u2019s exhibits E through J. DOHA received the transcript on May 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions into the findings of fact, and make the following\nadditional findings.\nApplicant is a 38-year-old woman with two children, ages 2 and 15. She has been married\nsince 2002, and has been married twice previously. She served in the U.S. Army from 1989 through\n1991 when she was honorably discharged. She has earned three years of college credits.  Since\n2001, she has worked for an insurance company that has a contract with the Department of Defense.\nApplicant is highly respected at work and in her community.

She owned it, and\nhe helped her with the mortgage payments.  In approximately 1999, their relationship began to\n3\ndeteriorate. In March 2000, the boyfriend\u2019s increasingly violent conduct prompted Applicant to\nvacate the mobile home and obtain a domestic violence protective order \u201cto bring about a cessation\nof acts of domestic violence.\u201d  Under the order, the boyfriend was to refrain from any contact with\n4\nher, and enable her to return to the mobile home with a sheriff to retrieve clothing and toiletries. He\nremained in the mobile home after she moved.\nShortly thereafter, Applicant\u2019s boyfriend stopped assisting with the mortgage payments.\nApplicant, fearing for her safety, never confronted him about the payments.  Instead, she contacted\n5\na representative of the mortgagor, informed him of her predicament, stated she was unable to make\npayments, and requested a voluntary repossession.  The mortgagor rejected her request, and\n6\nrepossessed the property in April 2001.\nThe record is unclear with respect to when the mortgagor resold the property, and the\namount of the deficiency. According to a September 2006 credit report, Applicant owes $81,000.7\nApplicant argues that the amount owed, if any, is nominal because she purchased it for $81,000, and\nthe mortgagor resold it for $76,000 after the repossession. In support of her contention, she\nreferences a property tax record containing a chronology of transactions involving the property.  A\n8\nMarch 2007 credit report lists the deficiency as $68,690.  Applicant wrote a letter to the mortgagor\n9\ninforming it of her dispute in May 2007.10\nBoth of the other debts listed in the SOR grew delinquent during Applicant\u2019s separation\nfrom her boyfriend in the late 1990s. She did not address them until she prepared to buy a house in\n\nTr. 31.\n11\nExhibit D, Credit Bureau Report dated March 16, 2007, at 1.\n12\nTr. 22.\n13\nExhibit E, Letter from Applicant to Creditor.\n14\nTr. 33.\n15\nId.\n16\n4\n2005.  As of September 2006, she owed the creditor listed in subparagraph 1.a approximately\n11\n$1,000. She satisfied it in February 2007.12\nAs of October 2005, Applicant owed the remaining creditor listed in the SOR approximately\n$4,600. When she contacted the creditor in June 2006 to arrange a payment plan, she was told that\nthe delinquency had been assigned to a collection agent.  Using the phone number given to her by\n13\nthe creditor, she then attempted to contact the collection agency, but was unsuccessful. On May 1,\n2007, she wrote the collection agency. In the letter, she proposed to satisfy the delinquency through\nfive monthly payments.14\nIn August 2006, Applicant successfully applied for a $149,000 mortgage loan. Since moving\ninto the new home, she has made payments as scheduled.  She pays all of her other monthly bills\nin a timely fashion, and has not accrued any additional delinquent debt since remarrying in 2002.15\nShe has approximately $1,500 remaining each month after expenses.16\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September\n1, 2006, apply to ADP trustworthiness determinations. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in\ndeciding whether to deny or revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information\nor eligibility for occupying a sensitive position (disqualifying conditions), and those that may be\nconsidered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access. An administrative\njudge need not view them as inflexible rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the\nAdjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist\nthe administrative judge in reaching fair, common sense decisions.\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\n\nSee Directive \u00a7\u00a7 2.3, 2.5.3, 3.2, and 4.2.\n17\n5\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.\nSince the protection of national security (and sensitive information) is the paramount\nconsideration, the final decision in each case must be reached by applying the standard that the\ndetermination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n17\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the\ngovernment, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness\ndetermination.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nBetween 2000 and 2002, Applicant accrued two delinquent credit card debts in the\napproximate amount of $6,000, and lost her mobile home to repossession. Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(c): A history of not meeting financial obligations, applies.\nApplicant\u2019s most significant delinquency corresponded with the breakdown of a volatile\ndomestic relationship. Specifically, upon moving out of the mobile home for her safety, her ex-\nboyfriend, who remained, stopped assisting her with the mortgage payments. Unable to make the\npayments alone, she contacted the mortgagor to request an involuntary repossession. It refused, and\nsubsequently repossessed the property involuntarily. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition\n(FC MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\napplies.\nApplicant disputes the amount of the deficiency owed to the mortgagor after the resale of\nthe mobile home. She alleges that the property was resold for nearly the amount of her original\npurchase price leaving her with a nominal deficiency balance. Although the document she provided\nin her Answer in support of this contention was not persuasive enough for me to incorporate it into\nthe findings of fact, it was persuasive enough, however, to meet the criteria governing the\napplicability of FC MC 20(e): The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\n\n6\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue, particularly in light of\nthe conflicting evidence provided by the government with respect to the deficiency balance.\nApplicant\u2019s handling of the other delinquencies does not satisfy the second prong of FC MC\n20(b). Although they accrued as a result of the same circumstances that generated the repossession,\nshe did not attempt to resolve them until approximately four years had elapsed. Nevertheless, she\nhas satisfied one of the delinquencies, and has taken steps to resolve the remaining delinquency. FC\nMC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts, applies. Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were caused by the domestic problems and ensuing\nseparation from an ex-boyfriend in the late 1990s. The significance of her separation is somewhat\ndiminished by the length of time she took to begin resolving her delinquencies. Any negative\ninference extrapolated from Applicant\u2019s procrastination is greatly outweighed by her otherwise\nexemplary character, her current strong financial standing, and the amount of time that has elapsed\nsince she experienced the financial difficulties. The evidence of these factors renders the likelihood\nof a recurrence of her financial problems and the potential for coercion minimal regardless of the\noutcome of her dispute with the mortgagor of the mobile home regarding the deficiency balance.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a\nsensitive position. Eligibility is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1., Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a\nsensitive position.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as\namended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on September 1, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was originally set for\nhearing before another Administrative Judge on December 5, 2008, but because of a\npotential conflict of interest, it was reassigned to me on December 12, 2008. DOHA\nissued a second notice of hearing on December 16, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on January 27, 2009, in Sacramento, California. The Government offered\n\n2\nExhibits 1 through 10, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified on her\nown behalf and submitted Exhibits A through C, which were admitted without objection.\nHer fiancee also testified on her behalf. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 4, 2009. Upon a\nrequest by Applicant, I allowed the record to remain open until February 27, 2009, so\nthat Applicant could offer documentation to show that her debts were discharged in\nbankruptcy. An additional document was timely received and has been identified and\nentered into evidence as Exhibit D, but it only was an indication of the opinion of\nApplicant\u2019s attorney regarding the status of the bankruptcy. Nothing definitive\nconcerning the bankruptcy status was offered. The record also was open to allow\nApplicant to offer positive character letters or employment evaluations, but none were\nreceived. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR contains 14 allegations, 1.a.,\nthrough 1.n., of overdue debt under Guideline F.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, including Applicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and\nthe live testimony, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 52 years old. She is currently separated from her husband, and she\nhas three daughters.

They both recommended to her that based on\nthe size of her debt and her income that her best course of action was to file for\nbankruptcy. She finally filed the Petition for Bankruptcy on December 3, 2008 (Exhibits\nA and B), showing the amount of claims from unsecured creditors in the amount of\n$64,315, and indicating that there would be a meeting of creditors on January 6, 2009.\nExhibit C established that February 6, 2009, was the last date for any creditor to file an\nobjection. \nThe post hearing document offered by Applicant is an email from Applicant\u2019s\nbankruptcy attorney to her (Exhibit D), indicating that he anticipated that the Bankruptcy\nCourt should issue her discharge after March 9, 2009, and while he did not anticipate\nany issues, it was possible that a creditor could raise one.  The list of creditors on the\nBankruptcy Petition does not correspond completely to the list of debts on the SOR, but\nit appears that all or most of the SOR debts would be resolved if they are discharged in\nbankruptcy. However, as indicated above, even though the record was kept open until\nFebruary 27, 2009, no definitive evidence was introduced to show that these debts\nhave been discharged in bankruptcy. \nApplicant testified that even if all of the debts listed in the bankruptcy are\ndischarged, she still has some additional debts. These include approximately $22,000\nfor her student loans, $5,000 for a new student loan for her daughter, which she will\nstart owing in September 2009, and $14,000 for a car loan for a vehicle that she\npurchased in 2008, and for which she pays $363 a month. All of these debts are3 being\nresolved responsibly. \nApplicant contended during her testimony that her primary financial problems\noccurred during the years between 2003 and 2005, when she was unemployed or\nunderemployed. However, in her responses to interrogatories on November 22, 2007,\n\n4\n(Exhibit 3), she stated that the majority of her debt was incurred from 4 to 10 years\nbefore her response, or from 1997 to 2003. \nApplicant\u2019s fiancee testified that he and Applicant plan to marry after the\nbankruptcy is filed and she can divorce her current husband, from whom she has been\nlong separated. He believes that Applicant can handle her finances now and will not be\nin financial trouble in the future.  \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is\npotentially disqualifying. Similarly (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may\nraise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nUnder Mitigating Condition 20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted\nabove, most of the financial problems arose from Applicant\u2019s loss of employment and\nunderemployment.  Applicant  acted responsibly in continuing to take care of her minor\n\n6\ndaughter and more recently identifying and attempting to resolve these debts. I find this\npotentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nSimilarly, MC 20 (d) applies where the evidence shows the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to resolve debts. Applicant has been attempting to resolve all the\ndelinquent debts, through bankruptcy, and based on the court documents and the\nrepresentation from the attorney for Applicant, the bankruptcy appears to be in the final\nstages. She is now more financially sound and better prepared for future contingencies.\nI conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nlargely resulted because she was a single parent for a number of years with a limited\nincome, and she accumulated debt due to circumstances largely beyond her control.\nSignificantly, she has taken affirmative action to resolve her delinquent debts.\nOverall, the record evidence is favorable as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability\nfor a public trust position under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: \nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: \nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: \nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.: \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant, a 58 year old employee of a defense contractor, born in Taiwan, emigrated to the\nU.S. from Canada in 1980 and became a citizen in 1994. She has been an employee of the same\ncorporation since 1984 holding a security clearance since she became a U.S. citizen. She mitigated\nsecurity concerns based on her 80-year-old mother and three siblings who live in Taiwan by\ndemonstrating her strong ties in the U.S. including her two children who are professionals with U.S.\neducation and her long and outstanding record with her company. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 23, 2006, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, dated November 16, 2006, Applicant responded to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January\n8, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued March 2, 2007 for a hearing held on March 21, 2007. At\nthe hearing, the Government introduced three exhibits, and Applicant introduced four. All were\nadmitted into evidence. The Government offered eleven documents for administrative notice. The\nApplicant testified on her own behalf. The transcript was received on March 30, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the specific security concerns under Foreign Influence Guideline\nB regarding her mother and three siblings who are citizens of and live in Taiwan. The admissions\nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and\nupon due consideration of the record, the following additional findings of fact are made:\nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a major defense contractor who works as a senior\ncomputer systems analyst on a naval electronics system (Exh. B). She was born in Taiwan and\nreceived a college degree in literature and philosophy. She was married in Taiwan in 1972 and\nemigrated to Canada with her husband in 1973. Their two children were born in Canada. They\nemigrated to the U.S. in 1980 and were divorced in 1984. Since she had no work related skills and\nneeded to support a family as a single parent, she took computer courses at a local college and\nobtained the employment she continues to perform for her company. She has steadily advanced in\npositions with her company (Exh. A). She became a U.S. citizen in 1994 and renounced her\nCanadian citizenship in 2006 (Exh. 3). She visited Taiwan in 2006, the first time in 19 years since\nshe attended her father\u2019s funeral in 1987.\n\n3\nApplicant has worked in the same installation for the same company and its predecessor\nowners for 22 years. She has held a security clearance for 13 years just five months after becoming\na citizen. She is highly regarded by her company and her supervisor who submitted a statement for\nher in which he notes her excellent work ethic and solid performance that led to receipt of an award\nfor outstanding performance and contributions to Navy programs (Exh. A).\nHer need for a clearance is based primarily on a job requirement for access to databases for\nparts to determine delivery dates, and for access to military facilities where she may be assigned. She\nhas never had a security violation or negative security comment in regard to security policies or\npractices in her 22 years with her company (Exh. A).\nApplicant has two adult children. Her daughter has an MBA from a major east coast\nuniversity and works for a prominent U.S. film producer. Her son is a medical doctor. Because her\nchildren were born in Canada, they have dual citizenship with the U.S. and Canada. Both children\nvisited Taiwan when very young but only her daughter has visited as an adult when she went with\nApplicant in 2006.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is 80 years old. She telephones her approximately every two weeks. Her\nmother came to the U.S. on two occasions over ten years ago when she went on two tours on the\nWest Coast. Since Applicant lives on the East Coast they did not visit. She saw her mother in Taiwan\nin 2006 and 1987. \nApplicant\u2019s siblings consist of a sister who now writes children\u2019s books and was a nurse\u2019s\naide. Their mother lives with her in Taiwan. She also does web sites for books (Exh. C). One brother\nis with a private company living near their mother. A second brother is an interior designer for\nprivate homes for the past five years. He travels to the PRC frequently in his work since there are\nmore homes and apartments being built there than in Taiwan. He is allowed to enter the PRC to\nwork, but must have a permit to do so. He came to the U.S. in 2003. That was the last time she saw\nhim as she did not see him on her trip to Taiwan in 2006. \nApplicant regards herself and her family as completely American and considers her ancestry\nas only Taiwanese. She has no interest in returning to Taiwan and as all her ties are in the U.S. She\nhas lived in the same apartment for 20 years since 1987. She enjoys U.S. cultural life and spends\nmost of her time outside of work reading and traveling in the U.S. to visit her children (Tr. 47). She\nhas voted in all three presidential elections since becoming a U.S. citizen. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\n\n4\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant\u2019s clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cA security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family and other persons to whom\nhe or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States\nor may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that\ncould result in the compromise of classified information.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1. Having\nimmediate family members who are citizens of, and residing in a foreign country, may raise a\ndisqualifying security concern. Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1. \nCONCLUSION\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set\nforth in the SOR:\nConditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or\ncoercion (AG \u00b6 7a). Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of\nfamily members living abroad, the Government established a basis for concern over foreign influence.\nThe Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes,\nmitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nBy virtue of the relationships of the foreign family members, Applicant\u2019s contacts, though\ninfrequent, cannot be deemed casual. Mitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a\ndetermination that the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which the\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual group or government and the interests of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8a). The other relevant\nMC is that the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the US.,that\n\n5\nshe can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8b). I find that both\nare applicable.  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s mother lives in Taiwan, she is a an octogenerian whose only contacts  with\nher daughter are by telephone. They have had very little personal interaction over the past 20 years\nexcept for Applicant\u2019s one visit to Taiwan in 2006. Even when visiting the U.S. she came on tours\nto the opposite side of the country and did not see Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s sister and two brothers are in commercial activities totally unrelated to the\ngovernment of Taiwan. The department counsel acknowledged that the brother who travels to the\nPRC is the most problematic member of her family. But he does interior design work, and is not\nemployed by either the government of Taiwan or the government of the PRC. He is required to obtain\na permit to enter the PRC but that appears to be a routine practice for persons doing commercial\nwork. \nThe most important mitigating factor is Applicant herself and her total commitment to the\nU.S. through her long employment and excellent record with a major defense contractor and the\nlengthy period she has held a security clearance without problems. She has lived in the same place\nfor over 20 years and has children who are well educated in the U.S. and hold professional positions\nin their fields. \nWhile Taiwan, as do other countries, engages in industrial espionage (Exh. XI), none of her\nrelatives living in Taiwan pose a potential security threat or are in a position likely to be influenced\nby the Taiwan or PRC governments. None of them work for the Taiwan government or are involved\nin work that might create security issues for the U.S. Any potential security concerns relating to\npossible future trips to Taiwan are minimal considering the infrequency of her past travels to Taiwan\nand knowledge of security requirements. Applicant can be relied upon to take whatever steps are\nnecessary to eliminate any possible risk.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security of the\nnation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case\nmust be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying\nsound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nLooking at her as a whole person, Applicant presents a highly credible case that she would\nnot be influenced by anything contrary to the best interests of the U.S. Her strong ties the U.S.\ncontrast with her minimal ties to Taiwan. Her residence in the U.S. for over a quarter of a century and\ncareer record as a trusted employee of major U.S. corporations for 22 years effectively refute the risk\nthat she would now take any action that would jeopardize U.S. security interests. She has assimilated\ninto U.S. customs and culture, and has become a model employee of a major defense contractor\nworking on an important national defense program.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\n\n6\nclearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph l Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nAfter full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case, it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted. \nCharles D.

Although she denies using\namphetamines/methamphetamine, she provided insufficient evidence to rebut the positive drug\nscreening test. Applicant's eligibility for a assignment to a sensitive position is denied.\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and  Memorandum\n1\nfrom the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Counterintelligence and Security, titled \"Adjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases,\" dated November 19, 2004.\n Tr. at 6; Gov Ex 1.\n2\n Tr. at 29-30.\n3\n Gov 3. \n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn February 23, 2006, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \"Directive\");  and the Revised\n1\nAdjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on December 29, 2005, effective September 1,\n2006. On February 8, 2007,  DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nbasis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security\nconcerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.\nIn a sworn statement dated March 9, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on June 20, 2007. It was\ntransferred to me on August 2, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on August 6, 2007, scheduling\nthe hearing for August 29, 2007. The hearing was conducted on that date. The government submitted\nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1- 4 which were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified on her own behalf, and submitted five exhibits which were admitted without objection as\nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A-E. I took administrative notice of a document submitted by the\nGovernment and marked it as Administrative Notice Document I (Admin Not I). DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 7, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, and denies SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, and\n2.a.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review\nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 23 year old woman employed as a pharmacy technician for a Department of\nDefense contractor who is seeking a position of public trust.  She has worked for her employer since\nJuly 2005.  She is a high school graduate.  She attends college part-time studying pre-pharmacy.

She denies using amphetamines or methamphetamine prior to her drug screening\ntest.   She experimented with marijuana and methamphetamine while in high school.\n5\n6\nApplicant admits to taking Clonazepam pills, on two occasions in late August 2005.\nClonazepam is a Schedule IV controlled substance.  The pills were prescribed to her mother.  She\n7\nwas aware that she should not have taken pills that were prescribed to someone else.  She believes\ntaking the Clonazepam is what caused her positive drug screening test. She stated that Clonazepam\nis an anti-anxiety medication and she took the pills to help her sleep. She states that Clonazepam is\na benzodiazepine which she describes as \"sort of like a sedative for the central nervous system.\"8\nThe September 2005 drug screening results indicated that Applicant tested negative for\nbenzodiazepine.  She could not explain why she tested negative for benzodiazepine.  She could not\n9\n10\nexplain why she tested positive for amphetamines/methamphetamine.  She did not discover that her\n11\npositive drug test was for amphetamines/methamphetamine until she was provided the test results\nin conjunction with this case. She would have disputed the positive test results immediately had she\nknown that the results indicated that she tested positive for amphetamines/methamphetamine.12\nOn February 23, 2006,  Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85-P).13\nIn response to question \"21a. Illegal Drugs.  In the last year, have you illegally used any controlled\nsubstance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine,\ncodeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbituates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.),\nhallucinogenics, (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\" Applicant answered, \"yes\" and listed\nusing Clonazepam twice in August 2005.  She did not list amphetamine/methamphetamine use. She\n14\nadmits \nto \ntaking \nClonazepam \nwithout \na \nprescription \nbut \ndenies \ntaking\namphetamines/methamphetamine.15\n\n AE A. \n16\n AE B.\n17\n AE C. \n18\n Tr. at 31.\n19\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n20\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 24.\n21\n5\nApplicant's supervisor states that Applicant is a woman of great integrity who is extremely\ndedicated to her work.  She describes her as \"dependable, reliable, hard-working and honest.\" She\nhas taken a lead role in the department over the past six months and has gained respect from her\npeers due to her knowledge and ability.  A co-worker who has worked with Applicant for one year\n16\nand eight months also finds her to be dependable, hard-working, and honest.17\nOn May 1, 2007, Applicant saw a doctor related to her sleeping problems. She was\ndiagnosed with insomnia and prescribed medication to treat her condition.  The medication was not\nClonazepam.  \n18\nApplicant works full-time and takes nine hours of classes.  She provided a urine sample for\ndrug screening in November 2005 when she was hired by her current employer. She assumed the\nurine sample was negative because she has never been notified of the results. She testified that she\nhas no intent to use illegal drugs and/or use prescription medications that are not prescribed to her\nin the future.  \n19\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n20\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch.  On December 29, 2005, the President approved Revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nwhich became effective on September 1, 2006.\nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive and the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative\nguidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement - Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.21\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n22\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n23\n Id.\n24\n Id.\n25\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n26\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n27\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n28\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n29\n6\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.22\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth\nand discussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An\n23\nadministrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the\n24\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness\nof participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n25\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n26\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n27\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n28\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n29\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n7\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.\nDrug Involvement\nBased on all the evidence, Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) \u00b6 25(a) (any\ndrug abuse), and DI DC \u00b6 25(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use) apply to Applicant's case.\nApplicant admits to taking Clonazepam, a schedule IV controlled substance, on two occasions in\nAugust 2005.  She had no legal prescription for this drug. In September 2005, she tested positive for\namphetamines/methamphetamine during a drug screening test conducted by her employer.\nApplicant has the opportunity to mitigate the concerns. Two of the Drug Involvement\nMitigating Conditions (DI MC) have the potential to apply. DI MC \u00b626(a) (the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not\napplicable.  Although Applicant's positive drug test and use of Clonazepam happened two years ago\nand there is no evidence of subsequent drug use, I cannot apply DI MC \u00b6 26(a) because of Applicant's\npositive drug test for amphetamines/methamphetaminein September 2005. It was Applicant's burden\nto mitigate the concerns raised by the positive drug screenng test. She has not met the burden.\nConcerns remain about her trustworthiness and good judgment. \nDI MC \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation) is not applicable. Applicant testified that she has\nnot used drugs since August 2005 and that she has no intention of using illegal drugs or drugs without\na prescription in the future.  However, a trustworthiness concern remains due to her failure to provide\na sufficient explanation for testing positive for amphetamines/methamphetamine.\nApplicant has not met her burden to mitigate the drug involvement trustworthiness concern.\nGuideline H is decided against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\n \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the\ncentral question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a\nsecurity clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern.  It is deliberate if it is done\nknowingly and willfully.  \nIn this case, Applicant did not list using amphetamine/methamphetamine in response to\nquestion 21(a) on her questionnaire for public trust position.  The September 2005 positive drug\nscreening test result supports the assertion that she used amphetamines/methamphetamine.  Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\n\n8\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)\napplies.\nI find none of the personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC) apply to Applicant's case.\nPC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment,\nor falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not apply.  While Applicant disclosed\nher Clonazepam use, she did not disclose her use of amphetamine/methamphetamine.  She maintains\nthat she did not use amphetamines/methamphetamine in September 2005.  The positive drug test\nindicates otherwise.  Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to challenge the validity of the\ntest.\nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable.\nAlthough Applicant appears to be a bright young woman, I cannot conclude that the positive drug\ntest result for amphetamine/methamphetamine is invalid. Her failure to admit and/or disclose her\namphetamine/methamphetamine use on her trustworthiness questionnaire raises questions about her\nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.   \nPC MC \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors\nthat caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur) is not applicable for the reasons mentioned above. \nApplicant did not meet her burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised by her\nfailure to disclose her amphetamine/methamphetamine use on her trustworthiness application.\nGuideline E is concluded against Applicant.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. Applicant has a favorable work history with her current job. However, she failed to\nmeet her burden to mitigate the concerns raised under drug involvement and personal conduct.  A\nquestion remains about Applicant's reliability and trustworthiness due to her inability to explain the\npositive test result for amphetamines/methamphetamine in September 2005. Based on the evidence\nin the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for\nassignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n9\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  Eligibility is denied.\nErin C. Hogan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

There is now\n5\na zero balance in this account.6\nDuring his second marriage, Applicant left his home to move to another state for a contractor\nposition. He was solely responsible for paying for his expenses to move to the other state. He\ncontinued supporting his family at home while he was away. The contractor did not get the contract,\nso he was laid off and returned home to his family.  He was out of work for about a month. Debts\n7\nbecame delinquent and his finances were fragile, eventually the debts overwhelmed his means to pay\nthem off. In October 2002, his wife lost her job.  The family went from a two-income household, to\n8\none income. She was unemployed for a year and one-half.  During this period, debts fell behind\n9\nbecause of nonpayment. When his wife returned to work in 2004, the financial strain decreased.\nSome creditors wanted to be paid in full on a delinquent account and would not accept monthly or\npartial payments.10\nIn February 2004, a delinquent debt belonging to Applicant was placed for collection in the\namount of $3,315.30. Applicant was informed that he could settle this debt for $2,700.  By letter\n11\ndated March 19, 2007, he satisfied this debt in full.  A Notice of Satisfaction of this debt states that\n12\nthe debt was satisfied on February 26, 2007.13\nApplicant owed $9,630.60 for an account placed for collection in February 2004. In a letter\ndated January 22, 2007, Applicant was informed that a judgment was issued for $6,373.31.

The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n25\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n26\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n27\n6\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.27\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nFinancial considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant filed for bankruptcy in 1999 and his debts were discharged in June 2000. He was\nindebted on delinquent debts to three creditors for about $13,000. Thus, Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC\n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. The Government has established a\nprima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F, financial considerations.\nVarious factors can mitigate financial considerations. Applicant\u2019s wife was unemployed for\none year and one-half. Their two-family income was cut in half and they were besieged with living\nexpenses and bills that strained their tight budget. By the time she went back to work in 2004, they\nwere playing catch up with their delinquent debt. Applicant is no longer in a dire financial situation.\nHe proffered evidence of payment of all the debts listed in the SOR. The record does show that he\nwas able to settle some of the debts for less money than he originally owed. However, he did not\nshirk his responsibility for payment of those debts. Once he refinances his house, he should have a\nmuch better cash flow. Based on those facts, Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC\nMC) \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol, e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) and \u00b6 FC MC\n20(c) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts) apply.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\nhas had some precarious financial situations to deal with during the past few years. His wife was\nunemployed for more than a year. Numerous debts became delinquent. Once she returned to work,\n\n7\nthe family was slowly on the road to managing their finances and paying off their delinquent accounts.\nApplicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s case. Allegations 1.a through 1.d of the SOR are found for\nApplicant. Based on the evidence of record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to\nclassified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

She has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial\nconsiderations. Applicant's eligibility for a trustworthiness position is denied.\n\nThis action is taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended.\n1\nThe government submitted eight items in support of its contentions.\n2\nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated October 19 2006) at 1-3.\n3\nItem 5 (Application for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P), dated January 3, 2006) at 1-9.\n4\nItem 2, supra note 3, at 1-3.\n5\nId.\n6\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 3, 2006, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP\nI/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On September 28, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F,\nFinancial Considerations of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,\nand implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn October 19, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s written case on March 2, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material\n(FORM) on March 6, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material\nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  Applicant submitted additional information\n2\non April 5, 2007. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.g. in her SOR response under Guideline\nF.   She denied the remaining Guideline F allegations. The admissions are incorporated as findings\n3\nof fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make\nthe following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 37-year-old woman employed as nurse in a position of public trust for a\ndefense contractor. After graduating from high school in 1988, she attended college and received a\ndegree in nursing in 1996. She has worked for her current employer for more than a year.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n11\n3\npast due on the student loan account more than 120 days in September 2005.  Applicant offered no\n7\nexplanation for any debts. Multiple accounts were charged off or placed for collection between 2001\nand 2004, including credit card debt. Several of the debts have been in collection since 2000.  \n8\nApplicant has not made any payments on the delinquent accounts. In her October 19, 2006\nletter, Applicant provided no evidence of any mitigating conditions involving medical problems or\nother extenuating circumstances.  She reported that she is actively pursuing settlements and disputed\n9\ndebts with the companies listed on the SOR. Applicant noted she obtained copies of her credit\nreports and \u201cis actively resolving all debts.\u201d The record contains no information concerning her\nincome or expenses. Applicant traveled abroad for pleasure in June 2005.10\nApplicant provided no information concerning her work record. \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n11\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a). The adjudicative guideline at issue in\nthis case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n12\n Id.\n13\n Id.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n18\n4\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as\nthose which could mitigate concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n12\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n13\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n14\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.15\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n16\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n17\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n18\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n19\n5\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.19\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued  delinquent\ndebts with an approximate total balance of $43,978. It produced substantial evidence that Applicant\naccrued debt over six years. Applicant admits to four credit card debts. Her 2006 and 2007 credit\nreports confirm the debts. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC)\nAG \u00b619(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619 (c), (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620 (a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does not apply because\nshe still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt. Two collection accounts are from 2001.\nDespite steady employment, she has not made any payments on her debts for several years.\nApplicant provided no evidence or explanation concerning any conditions or situations to\nsupport the FC MC AG \u00b620 (b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstance).\nFC MC AG \u00b620 (c) (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/\nor there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) does not apply. Her\nmere statement that she is actively pursing settlement and resolution of the debts, without  evidence\nof specific actions is not sufficient to mitigate her situation. A promise to take action in the future is\nnot sufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concern. All of the debts remain outstanding. She\nhas not taken any steps to resolve these debts. Applicant's financial problems remain, and it is unlikely\nthey will be resolved in the near future.\nFC MC \u00b620(d) (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is not applicable. Applicant has not shown that she established a record of\nsteady payments or financial stability. She made no attempts to resolve the majority of the delinquent\naccounts. I cannot conclude that she made a good-faith effort to resolve her debts despite her  stated\nintention to do so in the future. She has not paid even one small debt. \nThe issue is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of her outstanding debts,\nbut whether she has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigating or changed circumstances\nto warrant a favorable trustworthiness determination. Her remaining unpaid debt constitutes a\n\n6\ntrustworthiness concern. In the last few years, she has not made a concentrated effort to repay this debt,\ndespite steady employment since receiving her nursing degree in 1996. This presents a doubt about her\nwillingness to accept responsibility for her conduct and her trustworthiness to hold a position. She has\nnot mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. Even an applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct\nthat has negative trustworthiness implications. It is premature to grant Applicant a trustworthiness\nposition based on her lack of action toward resolving her delinquent accounts. Applicant has not met\nher burden in this case. Despite her steady employment since graduating from college in 1996,\nApplicant accrued multiple delinquent credit card accounts. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

He has sold his house; and as a result, has $100,000 in the bank to address the remaining\n$10,000 of debt.  The Applicant has also made arrangements to have his financial status\nprofessionally monitored.  His financial difficulties stemmed from conditions largely beyond his\ncontrol, an unexpected medical emergency and a resulting period of unemployment.  Under Criminal\nConduct, the Applicant pled no contest to Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) in 2004,\nmore than two years ago.  The Applicant has the unqualified support of those who know him, and\nis a Reserve Deputy Sheriff.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 11, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on November 6, 2006.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on December 22, 2006.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on January 19, 2007, and the case was heard on February 5, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary\nevidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on February 13, 2007.  Pursuant to the Applicant\u2019s\nrequest, however, the record was left open until March 16, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether\nthe Applicant's past Financial Considerations and one incident of Criminal Conduct militate against\nthe granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis for\nsubparagraphs 1.a., 1.f., 1.g., 1.i. and 2.a.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 47 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties stemmed from conditions largely beyond his control,\nan unexpected medical emergency and a resulting period of unemployment, of \u201c[f]ive and a half\nmonths\u201d (TR at page 28 lines 15~22, and at page 30 lines 16~24). He has since sold his house; and\nas a result, has $100,000 in the bank to address the remaining $10,000 of debt (TR at page 48 line\n\n3\n20 to page 49 line 13).  The Applicant has also made arrangements to have his financial status\nprofessionally monitored (TR at page 46 line 22 to page 47 line 18, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX)\nA at page 9).\n1.a., 1.g. and 1.k.  The Applicant has paid tax liens to his city/county government totaling\n$157 (TR at page 35 line 6 to page 36 line 1, at page 41 line 25 to page 42 line 14, at page 44 lines\n7~12, and AppX A at pages 3~8).\n\n4\n1.b.~1.e.  The Applicant is in the process of addressing student loans in an amount totaling\nabout $10,000 (TR at page 37 line 3 to page 41 line 2).  He is unable to get an exact accounting of\nwhat he owes (Id).\n1.f.  The Applicant disputes a debt to a communications provider in the amount of about $53\n(TR at page 41 lines 3~20).  He will pay this debt once the provider demonstrates the debt is the\nApplicant\u2019s (Id).\n1.h., 1.j., 1.m., 1.o., and 1.p.  The Applicant has paid his debts to various medical providers\ntotaling about $1,600 (TR at page 42 line 15 to page 43 line 1, at page 43 line 25 to page 44 line 6,\nat page 45 lines 12~20, at page 46 lines 7~21, and Government Exhibit (GX) 2).\n1.i. and 1.n.  The Applicant has \u201csatisfied in full\u201d a judgment to a bank for a credit card debt\nin the amount of about $2,600 (TR at page 43 lines 13~24, at page 45 line 21 to page 46 line 6, and\nAppX A at page 10).\n1.l.  The Applicant disputes a debt to another communications provider in the amount of\nabout $121 (TR at page 44 line 13 to page 45 line 11).  He will pay this debt once the provider\ndemonstrates the debt is the Applicant\u2019s (Id).\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\n2.a.  In September of 2004, the Applicant was arrested and subsequently pled no contest to\nDUI (TR at page 31 line 14 to page 32 line 19, at page 49 line 14 to page 50 line 11, and AppX B\nat page 1).  He describes what happened in the following colloquy:\nQ[uestion]  You said you had a dispute with your wife and you wanted to leave the\nscene and you brought a bottle with you.  Did you consume the alcohol in the\ndriveway and just passed out in your car?\nA[nswer]  No, I actually went up the street to a cul de sac that looks over my house\nand the valley.  It was 10:00 o\u2019clock at night.  I shut off my car, parked the vehicle\nand had a couple of drinks.  I pulled the seat back and went to sleep.\nQ[uestion]  So, you never actually drove your car while you were drunk?\nA[nswer]  Absolutely not, but it\u2019s still against the law (TR at page 49 line17 to page\n50 line 7).\nAs part of his sentence, the Applicant was placed on summary probation for five years (TR\nat page 31 line 14 to page 32 line 19, at page 49 line 14 to page 50 line 11, and AppX B at page 1).\n\n5\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security\nclearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant has a \u201chistory of not meeting [his] financial obligations,\u201d and an \u201c[i]nability\n. . . to satisfy debts.\u201d  These are the first and third disqualifying conditions under Financial\nConsiderations.  His financial difficulties, however, were caused by circumstances \u201clargely beyond\nthe . . . [Applicant\u2019s] control (e.g. loss of employment . . . medical emergency . . .),\u201d the second\nmitigating condition.  The fourth mitigating condition is also applicable as the Applicant has\n\u201cinitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve [his] debts.\u201d  He now\nhas $100,000 in the bank to address any future financial claims\nAs to his past Criminal Conduct, the first disqualifying condition is applicable, as there is\narguably \u201ca single serious crime.\u201d  The fourth disqualifying condition is also applicable, as the\nApplicant \u201cis currently on . . . probation.\u201d  These are countered, however, by the first mitigating\ncondition, as \u201cso much time has elapsed [more than two years] since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Here, the Applicant is a\nReserve Deputy Sheriff with an unrestricted driver\u2019s license (AppX B at pages 1~2).  Those who\nknow the Applicant, in law enforcement, at the workplace, and in the community, speak most highly\nof his character, credibility and trustworthiness (AppX C).  The totality of the Appellant\u2019s conduct\nand circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable Decision under the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown; and as such, Guidelines F and J are found for the\nApplicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\npast financial difficulties, and his isolated Criminal Conduct.  The Applicant has thus met the\nmitigating conditions of Guidelines F and J, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he\nhas met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines F and J.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September \n28, 2005. On August 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant=s receipt for the SOR is dated August 14, 2008. He answered the SOR \nin writing on August 22, 2008, and requested his case be decided on the written record \nin lieu of a hearing.  \n \n \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 23, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nOn November 7, 2008, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written \ncase.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the \nApplicant. He was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file on November 13, 2008.  \nApplicant did not file a response to the FORM within the 30 day time allowed that would \nhave expired on December 14, 2008. I received the case assignment on January 22, \n2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 22, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in && 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c of the SOR, with explanations. \n \nApplicant is 37 years old, divorced, and works for a defense contractor as a \ncomputer technician.  He is a veteran and received an honorable discharge.  His SF 86 \ndoes not show any periods of unemployment between 1998 and the present time which \nsignificantly would have decreased his income in that time period. (Item 5) \n \nApplicant admits three delinquent debts totaling $24,517.  First, Applicant owes \n$162 to a bank on a credit card debt.  He closed this account in 2001.  This debt has not \nbeen paid, except he submitted proof of payment of $57 in April 2008 on the credit card \ndebt, but no further proof of any payments.  (Items 5-10) \n \nApplicant also admits he owes $23,380 to a bank on a car loan debt.  He \nborrowed $27,000 to purchase the car in September 2004, and the monthly payments \nwere $685. He allowed this vehicle to be repossessed in 2005 after he could no longer \nmake the payments.  This debt has not been paid. (Items 5-10) \n \nFinally, Applicant also admits he owes $975 on a judgment for unpaid rent.  His \nformer roommate is also liable on this debt.  Applicant has not paid this delinquent debt. \n(Items 5-10) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nAccording to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the Awhole person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective & E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Since 2002 Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt \n($24,517) in only three debts that he has not paid or resolved. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20 of the guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties.  Those mitigating conditions are: \n \n (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue; and, \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n The burden of proof is on him to show that the mitigating conditions should apply \nto him. He failed in this burden. Examining each of the mitigating conditions, Applicant\u2019s \ndebts are current obligations, was not infrequent, and Applicant did not explain any \ncircumstances which were unlikely to recur, so \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply.  Applicant did \nnot explain that the conditions which caused his financial problems were beyond his \ncontrol, so \u00b6 20 (b) does not apply.  There is no evidence of any counseling undertaken \nby Applicant, so \u00b6 20 (c) does not apply.  There are no good-faith efforts shown to repay \nthese debts, so \u00b6 20 (d) does not apply.  Applicant has not stated any reasonable basis \nfor disputing these debts.  In fact, Applicant admitted the three debts, so \u00b6 20 (e) does \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nnot apply.  Finally, there is no affluence shown by Applicant, and \u00b6 20 (f) cannot apply.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions are factors for consideration in this case.   \n \nApplicant does not explain his inability or inaction over the past few years to \nrepay these three debts. He has not paid them, and offers no reasonable, good-faith \nexplanation as to why he has not resolved the debts listed in the SOR.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recentcy of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 37-years old and works \nfor a Federal contractor. He accumulated three debts over the past several years, but \ndoes not propose any action to repay these debts.  He had three years to repay the car \nloan.  The two smaller debts could have been repaid easily within the past two years, \nbut no such repayment has been taken. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) Applicant does not explain \nwhat plans he has to avoid such problems in the future. (See AG & 2(a)(2).)  Applicant \nprovided no information concerning efforts to repay the debts or behavioral changes to \nremedy the situation (See AG & 2(a)(6).)  The potential for coercion, exploitation or \nduress exists because of the size of the debt, which will affect his credit ratings, thereby \ncausing him to take advantage of any method to extricate his finances from this \npredicament, including coercive methods by other persons.

WILLIAMS\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFrancisco Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 44-year-old systems administrator and has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since December 2005. He has two outstanding judgments totaling approximately $20,082.\nHe has not filed federal income tax returns for tax years 1994 to 2005. Applicant has not mitigated\nthe financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\nEx. 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated January 14, 2005).\n1\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation in subparagraph l.b. However, at the hearing, he\n3\nadmitted the allegation in subparagraph 1.b of the SOR. Tr. 20. \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 14, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and completed a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86).  On November 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and\n1\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security\n2\nconcerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were not provided to Applicant when the\nSOR was issued.\nIn a sworn, written statement, dated December 5, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 13, 2007. A Notice\nof Hearing was issued on February 28, 2007, scheduling the hearing for March 22, 2007. The parties\nappeared at the hearing. Applicant received an earlier version of DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive)\nand not the revised AG. The copy was also illegible. Department Counsel provided Applicant with\na legible, correct version of the AG. Applicant was provided an additional 30 days to submit an\namended Answer. He declined this opportunity. He was offered additional time to prepare for the\nhearing. Applicant stated that he would be prepared to proceed with the hearing on April 6, 2007.\nOn March 23, 2007, an Amended Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for\nApril 6, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government submitted\n7 exhibits (Exs. 1-7) and Applicant submitted 14 exhibits (Exs. A-N), all of which were admitted\ninto the record without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 16, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations under\nGuideline F cited in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.a through 1.n.  Those admissions are incorporated\n3\nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 44 years old and has worked as a system administrator for a defense contractor\nsince December 2005. He is a high school graduate and has about a year and one-half of college.\nApplicant has held a Secret level security clearance since 1993. He was married from 1992 to 1995,\n\nTr. 49.\n4\nTr. 50.\n5\nEx. 2 (OPM Report of Investigation, Dates of Investigation 1/13/06-1/21/06).\n6\nTr. 38-39.\n7\nTr. 40.\n8\nTr. 21.\n9\nTr. 41.\n10\nTr. 71-73.\n11\nTr. 71-74.\n12\nTr. 42.\n13\nTr. 26, 53.\n14\nTr. 41.\n15\n3\nand has a 14-year-old child. His child support payments are approximately $266 per month, and\npayments are current.  He earns approximately $51,000 annually.\n4\n5\nIn 1972, Applicant\u2019s father founded a home security alarm company.  In 1985, Applicant\n6\ntook over the day-to-day operation of the company and his father ceased his involvement. Applicant\nwas unfamiliar with running a business, and he closed the business in 1992.  Applicant had unpaid\n7\nbusiness-related expenses, which became a personal liability.  He is indebted to the Internal Revenue\n8\nService (IRS) on a federal tax lien in the approximate amount of $16,038 entered in July 1994. The\ntax lien is for unpaid payroll taxes while the business was operating. There is also an outstanding\njudgment to a telephone company for services rendered to the defunct company in the approximate\namount of $4,044, entered in April 1993.9\nApplicant failed to file personal, federal income tax returns for tax years 1994-2005. He\ntestified that he did not file state income tax returns for tax years 1994-2005.  He claimed he has\n10\npaid both federal and state taxes by payroll deductions, and therefore he has been a responsible\ncitizen.11\nApplicant submitted copies of IRS Form 2040 EZ for tax years 1997 through 2006 that he\npurported to have completed. The documents were proffered as evidence that he was entitled to\nrefunds for all of those years. Applicant is of the opinion that the Government owes him money in\nthe form of refunds, based on his completion of tax returns that have not been filed.  He  will not\n12\nfile the completed tax returns until March 2009, or whenever the government asks for them,\nwhichever is earlier.  He is focusing on reducing his credit card debt, and he will not contact the IRS\n13\nsince he believes they seem to be willing to wait for their money.  Applicant testified that he did not\n14\nfile state income tax returns for tax years 1994-2005.  He argued that he has paid both federal and\n15\n\nTr. 71-73.\n16\nTr. 21.\n17\nTr. 21-22.\n18\nTr. 24.\n19\nEx. D (Credit Cards and Loans Spreadsheet).\n20\nTr. 24.\n21\nTr. 37.\n22\nEx.

B (Letter, dated April 2, 2007).\n24\n4\nstate taxes by payroll deductions, and therefore he has been a responsible citizen by having done\nthat.16\nOn September 8, 2001, he was living at his father\u2019s house, when many of Applicant\u2019s\npersonal belongings were lost in a house fire.  There was no insurance. Applicant then lived in\n17\nhotels for a period of six months. He purchased new clothing and other necessities. In total, he spent\napproximately $12,000 to replace what was lost in the fire.  He started incurring debt, and continued\n18\nto live on his credit cards for the next three years, until they were at maximum levels.  During the\n19\nperiod, employment was sporadic.\nIn December 2005, he found steady employment, which enabled him to start paying more\nthan the minimum payment on his credit card debt. From March 2006 to March 2007, he decreased\nhis total debt by $4,424.  He expects to have all of his credit cards paid off by September 2009.\n20\n21\nHe has been diligently paying off his card debt. He believes that in 2009, he will have no more than\n$5,000 in credit card debt.  With his credit card debt now more manageable, he will reach out to his\n22\nother creditors.\nApplicant submitted two letters of recommendation from associates. One associate currently\nworked with him and has known Applicant since 1992 and stated: \u201c[Applicant] is a knowledgeable\nand responsible security professional that I am honored to call a trusted peer in the security\nindustry.\u201d  He has known the other associate since 1983 in both an employment and social capacity.\n23\nShe indicated that Applicant \u201chas always been a truthful, honest and straightforward person.\u201d24\nPOLICIES\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n30\n5\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n25\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n26\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n27\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n28\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n29\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n30\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nFinancial considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The\n\n6\nGovernment has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations.\nApplicant has failed to file federal tax returns for the tax period 1994 through 2005. He\ntestified that he has not filed state tax returns for the same period of time. Moreover, he has not filed\neither state or federal tax returns for the tax year 2006. He does not expect to file state or federal tax\nreturns for the tax year 2007. His behavior epitomizes tax fraud and tax evasion. He cannot justify\nhis behavior by proffering completed tax forms that will not be filed until at least March 2009.\nMoreover, he unrealistically believes that because his plan is to pay off his credit card debt until it\nis manageable, it is okay for him to wait until March 2009 to resolve his outstanding tax issues with\nthe IRS. He mistakenly believes that by not contacting the IRS regarding his failure to file taxes, the\nIRS will not inquire about his failure to file taxes. Applicant\u2019s behavior of not filing federal and state\ntaxes for over a decade, shows his unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, which speak\nto his own personal responsibility with regard to security concerns. The Government places trust in\neach citizen to file tax returns. It relies on trust, just like providing access to classified information.\nApplicant has failed to live up to that trust when he decided not to file taxes for more than 10 years.\nMoreover, there are two outstanding judgments against him, related to a failed business. The federal\ntax lien for $16,038 was entered in July 1994. The judgement for an outstanding telephone company\ndebt for $4,044 was entered on April 7, 1993. Thus, Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nConditions (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC 19(b) (indebtedness\ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or\nintent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt), FC DC 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations), FC DC 19(d) (deceptive or illegal financial practices such as\nembezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing\ndeceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust), FC DC 19(e)\n(consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, a high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis), and FC\nDC 19(g) (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the\nfraudulent filing of the same) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate financial considerations. He lost his business in 1994. He was\nunemployed and underemployed during a period of time and his credit card debt became delinquent.\nHis business closed as a result of poor management, and two business debts of more than $20,000\nbecame personal liabilities. There was a fire in his residence and his personal possessions were\ndestroyed, which cost him approximately $12,000 to replace. Based on those facts, Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances) applies. However, Applicant has not filed federal tax returns\nfor the tax years 1994-2005. Thus, FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC 20(c) (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) do not\napply here. Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s case. Allegations 1.a through 1.n of the\nSOR are found against Applicant.\n\n7\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\nhas made curious lifestyle choices. While attempting to manage his credit card debt, he has decided\nto ignore a tax lien and a judgment, both relating to a failed business. Moreover, he has not filed\nfederal or state taxes in more than a decade, even though he believes he is due a federal tax refund\nfor most of those tax years. In balancing all the information of record, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his financial difficulties. Based on the evidence of record,\nit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. For the\nreasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old data communications technician employed by a defense contractor. Applicant has one daughter, born in 1977 (FORM, Item 4). The record is unclear as to his current marital status. Applicant started smoking marijuana in 1969, at the age of 15. Several years later, in 1974, he joined the U.S. Navy. His DD-214s (FORM, Item 6) indicate that his rate was Electrician\u2019s Mate/Fireman (E-3) and Missile/Missile Checkout Technician 2 (E- 5). He was granted his first security clearance in December 1974 (FORM, Item 4). Three times during his naval service, Applicant tested positive for TCH (marijuana). Although the SOR states that these tests occurred in 1983, I find that they occurred in 1976, 1983 or 1984, and in 1986 (FORM, Item 10). He does not recall the details of the 3 first failed random drug test in 1976, but in 1983 or 1984, he tested positive while serving at sea and was sent to Captain\u2019s Mast. He was removed from submarine duty and re-assigned to a surface ship. In 1986, while stationed on that ship, he smoked hash while on liberty. Subsequently, he tested positive for TCH and was discharged Under Other Than Honorable Conditions (FORM, Item 10).

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug\ninvolvement, criminal conduct, sexual conduct, and personal conduct. Accordingly, his\nrequest for a security clearance is denied.\nOn July 13, 2005, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions\n(SF-86) to request a security clearance required as part of his employment with a\ndefense contractor (FORM, Item 4). After reviewing the results of the ensuing\nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n1\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nOctober 31, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included 13 documents (Items 1 - 13) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nOn May 8, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\nwhich specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive\nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline D\n(Sexual Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG).2\nApplicant received the SOR (FORM, Item 3) on May 13, 2008. He signed his\nAnswer on May 19, 2008, in which he admitted to the following allegations in the SOR:\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b. and 1d under Guideline H; \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, and 2.b under Guideline J; \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b.\nand 3c under Guideline D; and \u00b6\u00b6 4.a, and 4.b. under Guideline E. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.c, which concerns the timing of his non-judicial punishments when he was serving in\nthe U.S. Navy; and 2.c, which is a cross-reference to 1.c. In his Answer, Applicant also\nrequested a decision without a hearing. \nOn August 4, 2008, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant\nmaterials (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant\n3\nreceived the FORM on August 12, 2008, and was given 30 days to file a response. He\ndid not submit a response to the FORM by the September 12, 2008 deadline. I received\nthe case on October 14, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I\nmake the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 54-year-old data communications technician employed by a\ndefense contractor. Applicant has one daughter, born in 1977 (FORM, Item 4). The\nrecord is unclear as to his current marital status.\nApplicant started smoking marijuana in 1969, at the age of 15. Several years\nlater, in 1974, he joined the U.S. Navy. His DD-214s (FORM, Item 6) indicate that his\nrate was Electrician\u2019s Mate/Fireman (E-3) and Missile/Missile Checkout Technician 2 (E-\n5). He was granted his first security clearance in December 1974 (FORM, Item 4).\nThree times during his naval service, Applicant tested positive for TCH (marijuana).\nAlthough the SOR states that these tests occurred in 1983, I find that they occurred in\n1976, 1983 or 1984, and in 1986 (FORM, Item 10). He does not recall the details of the\n\n3\nfirst failed random drug test in 1976, but in 1983 or 1984, he tested positive while\nserving at sea and was sent to Captain\u2019s Mast. He was removed from submarine duty\nand re-assigned to a surface ship. In 1986, while stationed on that ship, he smoked\nhash while on liberty. Subsequently, he tested positive for TCH and was discharged\nUnder Other Than Honorable Conditions (FORM, Item 10). \nAt the time of his discharge in 1986, Applicant decided to accept drug treatment\noffered by the Navy. He participated in both group and individual counseling, but does\nnot recall receiving a diagnosis or prognosis during his 30-day inpatient treatment\nprogram. Although he did abstain from marijuana following treatment, he later relapsed,\n\u201cI complied with the treatment for 2-3 years, exact date not recalled. I started smoking\nmarijuana again for no reason.\u201d (FORM, Item 10). \nApplicant smoked marijuana sporadically between 1989 and 2005, and three to\nfour times per year between 2005 and 2007 (FORM, Item 10, page 6). When he\ncompleted his security clearance application in July 2005, he denied any use of illegal\ndrugs during the seven years prior to completing the application (FORM Item 4). The\nlast date of use indicated in the record is approximately mid-October 2007, when\nApplicant smoked marijuana two weeks before his security clearance interview (FORM,\nItem 10). He states that he is not dependent on the drug, and it does not affect his\njudgment or his ability to hold a confidence. Applicant stated that he has no intent to use\nmarijuana in the future, but also that he \u201cwould possibly use marijuana if it were\npresented.\u201d (FORM, Item 10).\nIn June 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with Aggravated Sexual\nBattery and Taking Indecent Liberties with Children stemming from incidents that\noccurred on December 1, 1992, March 1, 1993, and May 1, 1993 (FORM, Items 7 - 10).\nApplicant states his spouse, stepdaughter, and two neighbor children were in his home.\nWhile Applicant tickled one of the children, his hand touched the child\u2019s breast. He does\nnot recall the incidents that generated the other counts of indecent liberties, and the\n\u201cdetails are fuzzy.\u201d (FORM, Item 10). He states that violence was not involved in any of\nthe incidents, and that his classification as a \u201cviolent sex offender\u201d (FORM, Item 9)\nresulted from his conviction on three counts of Taking Indecent Liberties with Children. \nApplicant pled guilty to three counts of the Indecent Liberties and was sentenced\nto five years on each count, suspended. He served 30 days in prison and was placed on\nsupervised probation, which ended in mid-2000. Applicant is a registered violent sex\noffender and is required to renew his registration on the state Sex Offender Registry\nevery 90 days (FORM, Item 9). He notes that his family, friends, and employer are\naware of his status (FORM, Item 10).\nAs part of his sentence, Applicant was required to participate in counseling. He\nattended sessions with two different counseling centers in late 1994, but did not believe\nthat either was helpful. In Fall 1995, he attended weekly one-hour counseling sessions\nfor two to three months at a third counseling center. He discontinued the therapy, but\ndoes not remember the reason. In approximately late 1996, Applicant began counseling\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n4\nthat continued for three years, until December 1999. He does not remember receiving a\ndiagnosis or prognosis at any of the counseling he attended (FORM, Item 10).\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept,\nthese factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline G (alcohol consumption) at AG \u00b6 21.\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUnder Guideline H, AG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug\ninvolvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nApplicant\u2019s admits to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b. and 1.d. He denies allegation 1.c., but\nonly as to the dates on which his non-judicial punishments occurred. He admits to the\nsubstance of the allegation, that he was punished three times for illegal drug use while\nserving in the Navy (FORM, Item 10).\nAvailable information requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at\nAG \u00b6 24(a) (any drug abuse); AG \u00b6 24(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use); AG \u00b6\n24(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia); AG \u00b6 24(g) (any illegal drug\nuse after being granted a security clearance); and AG \u00b6 22(h) (expressed intent to\ncontinue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue\ndrug use).\nIn his signed affidavit (FORM Item 10), Applicant admits to using marijuana, and\nto testing positive on three random drug tests administered to him during his service in\nthe Navy. The evidence shows that he began using marijuana in 1969, was granted his\nfirst security clearance in 1974, and failed his first random drug test in 1976. In addition,\nApplicant indicated in his response to Question 26(b) of his application that his security\nclearance was revoked in 1983 because of his use of marijuana (FORM, Item 4). These\nfacts indicate that he was using marijuana while he held a security clearance, and\nsupport application of AG 24(g). Applicant possessed an illegal drug on the numerous\noccasions over the almost 40 years that he used marijuana. Finally, Applicant failed to\nexpress a convincing intent to end his marijuana use, when he stated that he \u201c...would\npossibly use marijuana if it were presented.\u201d (FORM Item 10).\n\n6\nTwo mitigating conditions are relevant: AG \u00b6 24(a) (the behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) and AG \u00b6 24(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation).\nNeither mitigating condition applies. Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not in the\ndistant past, since his last known use occurred only one year ago. Moreover, Applicant\nshows little interest in discontinuing his drug involvement \u2013 he used marijuana in\nOctober 2007, in the midst of his security clearance investigation. Applicant\u2019s actions,\nand his statement that he might use it again if the opportunity arose, demonstrate that\nhe has no commitment to avoiding marijuana in the future. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern pertaining to criminal conduct is that\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30).\nHere, Applicant\u2019s admission that he was convicted of three counts of Taking\nIndecent Liberties with a Minor, a felony, (FORM, Item 10), requires application of both\nAG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c)\n(allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). Applicant denies allegation 2.c.,\nstating that it was \u201cNot clear\u201d (FORM, Item 2). It appears that he did not understand it\nreferred to the non-judicial punishment alleged in \u00b6 1.c. Applicant\u2019s admission to the\nsubstance of allegation 1.c. \u2013 that he received three non-judicial punishments for drug\nuse while serving in the Navy \u2013 carries over to allegation 2.c., which has independent\nsecurity significance under Guideline J.\nTwo mitigating conditions under Guideline J have potential application: AG \u00b6\n32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 32 (d) (there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\n\n7\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement). \nA substantial amount of time has passed since Applicant\u2019s sex-crime conviction\nand his non-judicial punishments. However, given the gravity of the sexual crime, and\nthe lack of a sincere intent to discontinue drug use, Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability\nremain in doubt. In addition, Applicant has provided no evidence of remorse,\nrehabilitation, or a mature understanding of the effect his conduct has had on his own\nlife or the lives of others. Neither AG \u00b6 32(a) nor AG \u00b6 32(b) can be applied.\nGuideline D, Sexual Conduct\nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern under Guideline D:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to all allegations under guideline D raise serious  security\nconcerns. The following disqualifying conditions are relevant: AG \u00b6 13(a) (sexual\nbehavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted) and\nAG \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or\njudgment). Although Applicant claims not to remember all the details of the three\nincidents in 1993, he pled guilty and was convicted of felonious sexual conduct. As a\nresult, he is listed on his state\u2019s registry of sex offenders and is required to periodically\nupdate his registration (FORM, Items 7, 8 and 9). AG \u00b6 13(a) applies. Applicant\u2019s lack of\njudgment implicates AG \u00b6 13(d). In fact, Applicant\u2019s conduct goes beyond poor\njudgment; his mistreatment of children, the most vulnerable members of society,\ndemonstrates a willingness to breach the trust relationship that should exist between\nadults and children.\nTwo mitigating conditions are relevant: (AG \u00b6 14(a) (the behavior occurred prior\nto or during adolescence and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar\nnature) and AG \u00b6 14(b) (the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or\nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Although there\nis no evidence of recent similar conduct, Applicant\u2019s behavior did not occur when he\nwas an adolescent (AG \u00b6 14(a), On the contrary, he was a mature adult of 39 years,\nmarried, with a daughter and step-daughter (FORM, Items 4 and 10). AG \u00b6 14(b) is\npotentially applicable because the criminal conduct occurred 15 years ago. However,\nbecause the record contains no diagnosis on which to gauge the severity of Applicant\u2019s\ncondition, and no prognosis as to the possibility of recurrence, I cannot predict\n\n8\nconfidently that Applicant  will not engage in such conduct in the future. AG \u00b6 14 (b)\ncannot be applied.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant admits to both allegations under Guideline E. Applicant\u2019s conduct,\nincluding his discharge from the Navy because of long-standing drug use, his repeated\npositive drug tests, his criminal sexual conduct, and his unwillingness to  commit to\nabstaining from the use of an illegal drug, all indicate not only a failure of good\njudgment, but a persistent unwillingness to conform to the rule of law.\nIn addition, AG \u00b6 16(a) applies (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities). When he completed his security clearance application\nin July 2005, Applicant disclosed that he used an illegal drug from 1983 to 1986,\napproximately 20 years in the past, but failed to disclose his recent use. Later, in his\n2007 affidavit (FORM, Item 10), he admitted that he used marijuana sporadically from\n1989 to 2005, including three to four times during 2005. His statement indicated that he\nhad been using marijuana for years, including during the seven years before he\ncompleted his application. Applicant admits in his Answer that he falsified the\ninformation he provided to the government (FORM, Item 2).\nThe potentially applicable mitigators are AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt,\ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts) and AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). However, these conditions do not apply.\nThe record contains no evidence that Applicant attempted to inform the government of\nthe true extent of his drug use, and AG \u00b6 17(a) cannot be applied. In addition,\nApplicant\u2019s falsification cannot be considered insignificant under AG \u00b6 17(c). The\ngovernment relies on information provided by Applicants, and deliberate falsification\nboth undermines the security clearance process, and casts serious doubts on an\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness.\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n9\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under the four cited Guidelines. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). \nApplicant is 54 years old and presumed to be a mature, responsible adult. Over\nalmost four decades, he continued to use marijuana, with no true intent to stop, despite\nthe negative consequences it has had on his life. He has failed to demonstrate\nrehabilitation or to express remorse for his sexual misconduct. In response to the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns about his drug use and arrest for sexual misconduct, he offered\nno explanation or mitigation, or even acknowledgment of the gravity of his conduct.\nAbsent such information, the record presents no evidence sufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns. A fair and commonsense assessment  of the available\n8\ninformation bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he has not\nsatisfied the doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests.\nBecause protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such\ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the government.9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto allow Applicant access to classified information.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 30, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Jacqueline T. Williams granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof Guideline G Mitigating Condition 23 (b)  is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding\n2\nno error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings: Applicant is 37 years old and works as a\nnetwork engineer for a defense contractor.  He was involved in multiple alcohol-related incidents\nbetween 1990 and 2003.  Applicant was found guilty of driving while intoxicated in 1990, 1994, and\n1995.  He was found guilty of reckless driving in 2000.  Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related charges in 1995\nand 2003 were either dismissed or resulted in not guilty findings.  The 2003 incident involved a\nserious accident in which Applicant survived a near death experience.  As a result, Applicant ceased\ndrinking alcohol completely from October 2003 to February 2005.  Since 2005 he has consumed a\nglass of wine on several occasions but has not been drunk or otherwise impaired.  Character\nreferences who were aware of his past alcohol abuse attested to his professionalism, integrity, and\nreliability, or to his favorable life style changes and responsible approach to alcohol since the 2003\nincident.\nIn deciding favorably for Applicant under Guideline G, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s\nconduct since the 2003 accident established a pattern of responsible alcohol use.  That conclusion\nis consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence and is not arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  There was no evidence that Applicant had ever been diagnosed as alcoholic or\nalcohol dependent and received a recommendation to totally abstain form using alcohol.  Nor was\nthere any evidence that Applicant currently consumes alcohol in excess or to the point of\nintoxication.  On the contrary, the record evidence indicated that since the 2003 incident Applicant\nhad a total of only four or five glasses of wine, of which two glasses were at a single setting.   See,\n3\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-12237 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2006).\nDepartment Counsel offers a plausible alternative interpretation of the record evidence.\nHowever, that alternative interpretation of the record evidence is of no moment.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See ISCR Case No. 06-08116 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).\n\n3\n \n \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin    \nJean E.

Between\n1990 and 2003, Applicant was involved in six different incidents related to alcohol abuse, which\nincluded several instances of being charged and in a couple of instances of being convicted of\ndriving while intoxicated. In October 2003, he was involved in a serious car accident, because of his\nabuse of alcohol. Since 2005, he occasionally has a glass of wine.

Applicant has\nmitigated the alcohol consumption and personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is granted.\n\nEx. 1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing, dated August 17, 2005).\n1\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 17, 2005, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation\nProcessing (e-QIP).  On December 8, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\n1\ndeclined to grant a security clearance, and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  detailing the basis\n2\nfor its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,\nand implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The\nrevised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nIn an undated Answer, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on January 26, 2007. A Notice of Hearing\nwas issued on February 8, 2007, scheduling the hearing for February 27, 2007. Applicant\u2019s attorney\nmoved for a continuance of the hearing to a date to be determined later. The motion was not objected\nto by the Government and it was granted. On April 10, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued,\nscheduling the hearing for May 2, 2007. Due to workload constraints, the case was assigned to me\non April 30, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\nsubmitted 3 exhibits (Exs. 1-3) and Applicant submitted 12 exhibits (Exs. A-L), all of which were\nadmitted into the record without objection. The record was left open until May 21, 2007, to give\nApplicant time to submit additional documents. By memorandum dated May 9, 2007, the\nGovernment forwarded two additional documents submitted by Applicant, without objection. These\ndocuments were identified as Exs. M and N and admitted. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May\n18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.b through 1.f and 2.a. Those\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the allegations in subparagraphs\n1.a and 2.b. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 37 years old and works as a network engineer for a defense contractor since\n2005. In 1993, he received a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering. He has never been\nmarried.\nIn the summer or fall of 2003, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In\nJanuary and February 2004, he was interviewed by an agent of the Defense Security Service\nregarding his SF 86. In approximately May or June 2005, Applicant was granted a secret level\nclearance. A couple of months after that, he submitted a new SF 86 for a top secret clearance.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Answer.\n3\nId.\n4\n4\nApplicant denies the allegation that he consumed alcohol, sometimes to the point of\nintoxication, from at least September 2000 to present. He stated that he did not drink any alcohol\nfrom October 12, 2003 to February 20, 2005. He indicated \u201cI had a near death accident on Oct. 11,\n2003 that I barely survived that changed my perspective on alcohol and my life.\u201d3\nApplicant was arrested on April 8, 1990, and charged with driving under the influence (DUI).\nHe was found guilty and forfeited a bond of $287. His driver\u2019s license was suspended.\nOn December 3, 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated\n(DWI) and resisting a police officer. He was found guilty of DWI. He was sentenced to two years\nprobation, required to attend an alcohol education program, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended.\nOn March 10, 1995, Applicant was charged with reckless driving to endanger. This charge\nwas dismissed.\nOn September 1, 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI and reckless driving.\nOn April 3, 1996, he would found not guilty.\nOn November 14, 1995, he was found guilty of DWI. He was sentenced to two years\nprobation, required to attend an alcohol education program, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended.\nHe complied with the court\u2019s order.\nOn November 10, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with five counts related to\nalcohol consumption while driving, including attempting to elude police, DUI, speeding, failure to\nmaintain lane, and reckless driving. He was found guilty of reckless driving, fined $1,200, ordered\nto complete a defensive driving course, perform 40 hours of community service, and serve 12\nmonths probation. He complied with the court\u2019s order.\nOn October 11, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. On November 20, 2003,\nhe was found not guilty. Applicant was in a car accident. He remembers driving his car toward the\nfront gate of his house before the car accident occurred. After the accident, due to brain swelling, he\ncould not remember six weeks of his life prior to the accident. \u201cThis accident changed [Applicant\u2019s]\nperspective on alcohol and [his] life.\u201d4\nIn response to question 23 on his E-QIP, (Your Police Record - For this item, report\ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken\nfrom the court record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the\nFederal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the\nauthority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. \u201cd. Have you ever been charged with or convicted\nto any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d). Applicant responded \u201cyes\u201d and listed offenses in\n2000 and 2003. He failed to disclose that he was charged with other alcohol-related offenses in 1990,\n1994, and 1995.

H (Statement, dated March 26, 2007).\n11\n5\nHe stated \u201cI had no intention to deceive anyone.\u201d  In completing the e-QUIP, he believed that any\n5\nincident that was more than 10 years old did not have to be reported. A witness corroborated\nApplicant\u2019s testimony and indicated that for many applicants confusion exists when completing a\nlot of the forms.6\nAt the hearing, two witnesses testified regarding Applicant\u2019s character. The first witness\nspent 20 consecutive years in the Navy, and retired in 2003 and returned to work as a civilian.  His\n7\nlast 16 years were in the intelligence industry. He has held a top secret clearance for the last 23 years.\nApplicant is his supervisor and they have worked together for the last two years and see each other\non a daily basis.  They have also interacted socially. This witness read the SOR and the allegations\n8\npertaining to Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse. At work, this witness has never questioned Applicant\u2019s\nprofessionalism, integrity, and reliability. He has not seen Applicant lack attention to detail or make\nmistakes because he was not paying attention to what was going on around him.  He endorses\n9\nApplicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. \nThe other witness has had a personal relationship with Applicant, having met him in\nNovember 2006. She works at a high school and is also a parent educator with special education\nchildren. She has an 8-year-old son and her father was an alcoholic. She was aware of the allegations\nin the SOR. Applicant occasionally visits the witness and her son for dinner and has interacted at\nother social gatherings with them both. In the last six months, she has seen him consume two glasses\nof wine. He has talked about his prior alcohol abuse. She does not believe he has a drinking problem\nand she believes he has always been honest with her.\nApplicant provided five character statements from colleagues he knows through work or\nsocially, one of whom testified at the hearing.  They all endorse his application for a security\n10\nclearance. In a letter dated March 26, 2007, one witness states \u201cI have been [Applicant\u2019s] roommate\nover the past 7 months and I have had interactions with him on a daily basis that entire time.\u201d  This\n11\nwitness indicated that he was aware of Applicant\u2019s past regarding abuse of alcohol and DUIs. While\nliving with Applicant, the witness stated \u201c[i]n the 7 months that I have lived with [Applicant] I have\nseen him consume alcohol only twice and I have NEVER seen him drunk, nor impaired by alcohol\nor any other substance.\u201d (Emphasis in original).\n\nEx.

In March 2007, he\nhad a balance of $48,696 in the same retirement savings plan.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n13\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n14\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n15\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n16\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n17\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.18\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nAlcohol Consumption\n\n7\nAlcohol Consumption is always a security concern because \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption\noften leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. The Government has proved a prima\nfacie case regarding alcohol consumption. Between 1990 and 2003, Applicant was involved in six\ndifferent incidents related to his excessive consumption of alcohol, which included being charged\nseveral times with alcohol abuse and a couple of instances of being convicted of driving while\nintoxicated. The car accident in 2003, was quite serious. Afterwards, he was hospitalized for\napproximately three months, and he returned to work  six months later. The accident was caused by\nhis excessive use of alcohol, although he does not have a memory that alcohol was involved with\nthe accident. Consequently, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions, AG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) and AG \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or\nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate alcohol consumption. Prior to the accident in 2003, Applicant\nwas not responsibly consuming alcohol. Since the 2003 accident, Applicant has changed his life.\nHe barely survived his near death experience in the car accident in 2003. Accordingly, that event\nchanged his perspective on alcohol and his life. He ceased drinking alcohol from October 2003\nthrough February 2005. Since 2005, he occasionally has a glass of wine. Based on those facts,\nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions, AG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her\nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol\nabuser)) applies. Allegations 1.a through 1.f of the SOR are found for Applicant. \nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because \u201cconduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \nThe Government has not proved a prima facie case regarding personal conduct. I conclude\nthat his 1995 incident for reckless driving, which was dismissed, does not constitute his\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, thus raising questions about his reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Moreover, regarding responses on the\nSF 86, Applicant testified that he was genuinely confused when responding to some questions. He\nbelieved that he only had to go back 10 years when filling out the August 2005 SF 86. Moreover, a\nwitness credibly testified that many people get confused by the time-frames requested in the\nquestions on the SF 86. Applicant did not deliberately falsify material facts in his SF 86.\nConsequently, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition, AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\n\n8\nor award fiduciary responsibilities) does not apply. None of the other available Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Conditions apply. Allegations 2.a and 2.b of the SOR are found for Applicant. \nI have considered all of the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Since\n2003, Applicant has modified his alcohol consumption. After a horrendous car accident in 2003, he\nceased drinking until February 2005. Since then, he occasionally has a glass of wine. He has\npurchased a home and routinely saves for his retirement. He has been extremely responsible since\n2003. Based on the evidence of record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to\nclassified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

She is employed by a defense contractor as an Electrical Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with her employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. The Applicant was born in Tehran, Iran to Iranian parents. Her parents divorced when she was two years old, and her mother moved to the United States and remarried. The Applicant was raised by her paternal grandparents until the age of nineteen, when she came to the United States.

She answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 24, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on June 4, 2008.  A notice\nof hearing was issued on June 17, 2008, and the matter was scheduled for hearing on\nJuly 10, 2008.  The Government presented two exhibits, referred to as Government\nExhibits 1 and 2, which were received without objection.  The Applicant presented\nfourteen exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through N, which were received\nwithout objection. The Applicant also testified on her own behalf.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 22, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\n\n2\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nconcerning the current political conditions in Iran.  Applicant had no objection.  (Tr. p.\n12).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but\nwere included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 35 years old and married.  She is employed by a defense\ncontractor as an Electrical Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in\nconnection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Tehran, Iran to Iranian parents.  Her parents divorced\nwhen she was two years old, and her mother moved to the United States and remarried.\nThe Applicant was raised by her paternal grandparents until the age of nineteen, when\nshe came to the United States.  In May 1993, the Applicant, was sponsored by her\nmother and came to the United States to pursue the American dream.  In 2000, she\nbecame a naturalized United States citizen.  \nIn 1999, the Applicant married an Iranian citizen who resides with her in the\nUnited States.  He currently has a green card.  Her husband plans to apply for United\nStates citizenship, but because of a criminal record, he is ineligible until he completes\nhis probation in 2009.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother resides in the United States and is a naturalized United\nStates citizen.  Her mother\u2019s husband has passed away.  Her mother had one daughter\nfrom the marriage.  The Applicant\u2019s half-sister resides in the United States with the\nApplicant\u2019s mother.  She has a young daughter, who is the Applicant\u2019s niece.\n      \nThe Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Iran.  The Applicant indicates\nthat she was never close to her father because she was raised by his parents. She last\nspoke to him in 2005.  Her father is 64 years old, and retired from working for a water\nand power company.  She does not know if the company he worked for is government\naffiliated. \n\n3\nThe Applicant explained that her father sent her paperwork to help him and his\nIranian wife get a green card to permit them to come to the United States.  The\nApplicant did not apply for him because she does not want him to stay with her.  Her\nfather knows that she is an electrical engineer and knows the name of the company she\nworks for.  The Applicant\u2019s father and his wife have two children.  \nThe Applicant has a half-brother and half-sister in Iran.  The Applicant\u2019s half-\nbrother is married, and he and his wife work for the same pharmaceutical company.\nThe Applicant has what she describes as a \u201cpolite relationship\u201d with her half-brother and\nhalf-sister.  She last spoke to her half-brother in August 2007.  They both know that she\nworks for a defense contractor as an Electrical Engineer.  The Applicant\u2019s half-sister\nresides with their father and is attending school.  The Applicant and her half-sister do\nnot get along.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s paternal grandmother, who raised the Applicant, and with whom\nthe Applicant has the closest relationship, is a citizen and resident of Iran.  Her\ngrandmother is now 87 years old and not in good health.  The Applicant\u2019s grandfather\npassed away in 1992.      \nThe Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen of Iran and a resident of both the United\nStates and Iran.  He has a green card that he obtained in 2002.  He splits his time\nbetween Iran and the United States.  He is a retired journalist for a local newspaper in\nIran.  He has two sons that reside in the United States.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s husband has one sister and two brothers who are citizens and\nresidents of Iran.  One of her brother-in-laws knows that the Applicant is an electrical\nengineer and where she works.  The other brother-in-law is mentally handicapped and\nneeds supervision.  Her sister-in-law and her husband in Iran are book publishers.\nThey have two children.  Her sister-in-law also knows the name of the company the\nApplicant works for.  \nSince 1993, the Applicant has traveled back to Iran on three occasions to visit\nher family there.  She traveled to Iran in 1997, in 2002 for her wedding ceremony and to\nshare her success with her grandmother, and in 2005, to attend her half-brother\u2019s\nwedding.  The only family that the Applicant felt she had in the United States was her\nmother.  In August 2007, because her grandmother was very ill, the Applicant made\narrangements with her other relatives to bring her grandmother to Turkey so that the\nApplicant could visit her.  The Applicant met her grandmother and other family members\nfrom Iran in Turkey for that visit.  \n     \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nher personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF-86) which was\nelectronically submitted on May 7, 2003.  Question 15 asked her, \u201cIn the last seven\nyears, have you had an active passport that was issued by a foreign government\u201d, to\nwhich she answered, \u201cNo\u201d.  This was a false response.  The Applicant failed to list the\n\n4\nfact that she had an Iranian passport which had been extended on May 13, 2002 to\nJune 16, 2007.  \n  \nQuestion 16 of the same security clearance application, asked the Applicant\n\u201cHave you traveled outside the United States on other than official U.S. Government\norders in the last seven years\u201d, to which the Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d.  This was a false\nresponse.  The Applicant failed to list the fact that she had traveled to Iran in 1997, and\nin 2002, for her wedding.\nFor three years, from 2003 through 2006, the Applicant did not disclose to the\nGovernment or to anyone else that she had an Iranian passport and that she had\ntraveled to Iran in 1997 and 2002.  The Applicant stated that she knowingly and\nconscientiously made the decision not to disclose this information, as she did not want\nanyone to know about her ties to Iran.  (Tr. pp. 84-85).  She had heard from her friends\nthat if she disclosed her travel to Iran it would look bad and it might jeopardize her\nchances of obtaining a security clearance.  (Tr. p. 87).  Her whole fear was that if she\ndisclosed her Iranian passport and her trips to Iran her security clearance might be\ndenied.  (Tr. p. 89).  She also stated that she did not know how important it was to be\nhonest.  (Tr. pp. 100 -101).    \nAfter waiting three years for the security clearance application process and after\nbeing removed from her position in the lab, the Applicant reported that she possessed\nan Iranian passport and that she had traveled to Iran in 1997 and 2002.  (Tr. pp. 67-68\nand 90-91).  The Applicant has since shredded her Iranian passport.  (Tr. p. 69 and\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit N).  She has not renounced her Iranian citizenship, but is willing to\ndo so.\nLetters of recommendation from professional associates of the Applicant,\nincluding her supervisor, attest to her outstanding work performance, diligence,\nreliability, trustworthiness and her expertise as an Engineer.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\nA, B, C, D, F, G, and H). \nApplicant\u2019s Performance Evaluations for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 reflect that\nshe either meets or exceeds expectations in every category.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).\nApplicant has received various awards and commendations for her contributions to the\ncompany.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J).\nSince members of Applicant\u2019s family are citizens and residents of Iran, it is\nrelevant to examine the status and the nature of the country.  Currently, Iran is\nconsidered one of the most dangerous adversaries to the interests of the United States.\nThe U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since April 7, 1980, following the\nNovember 1979 Iranian student occupation of the American Embassy in Tehran and the\nhostage taking of 52 Americans, which was supported by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,\nIran\u2019s leader at the time.\nThe United States Government\u2019s concerns with Iran\u2019s policies include, but are\nnot limited to the following: (1) its clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons of\nmass destruction, (2) its sponsorship of international terrorism, (3) its intervention into\nthe internal affairs of Iraq, (4) its aggressive efforts to undermine the Middle East peace\n\n5\nprocess, and (5) its human rights violation against its own people.  As a result of these\nconcerns, the U.S. prohibits most trade with Iran.\nPolicies\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided\ninto \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\n\n6\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in foreign influence and dishonesty that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant is subject to foreign influence (Guideline B) and has engaged in dishonest\nconduct (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the\nApplicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with her security\nclearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines B and E of the SOR.\nUnder Foreign Influence, Guideline B, Disqualifying Condition 7.(a) contact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  However\nMitigating Condition 8.(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S. also applies.  \nThe Applicant has immediate and extended relatives in Iran.  Her grandmother, is\nthe person with whom she has the closest bond of affection.  Her grandmother is a\ncitizen and resident of Iran, and has been like a  mother to the Applicant.  The\nApplicant\u2019s close and continuing contact with her grandmother as well as her contact\nwith other relatives in Iran pose a security risk.  Although she does not maintain regular\nconsistent contact with any of them, most of her relatives in Iran know what she does for\na living, and they know who she woks for. The Applicant has deep emotional ties with\nher family in Iran as evidence by her decision and great effort to hold her wedding\n\n8\nceremony in Iran with relatives instead of with her friends in the United States.  Under\nthe heightened scrutiny analysis, the Applicant\u2019s family in Iran pose a significant security\nrisk.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under this guideline.   \nUnder Personal Conduct, Guideline E, Disqualifying Condition 16.(a)  Deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigation conditions are applicable.    \nThe evidence shows that the Applicant intentionally falsified her security\nclearance application in 2003, by failing to disclose that she possessed an Iranian\npassport and that she traveled to Iran in 1997 and in 2002.  She failed to disclose this\ninformation  because she did not want to jeopardize her chances of obtaining a security\nclearance.  This intentional deception goes directly to the Applicant\u2019s credibility.  I\ncannot find that she is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to classified information.\nThe Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is\na negative factor for security clearance purposes when an Applicant has deliberately\nprovided false information about material aspects of her personal background.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is found against the Applicant.   \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, including her favorable\nrecommendations, performance evaluations and awards, however, it does not come\nclose to mitigating the negative effects of her foreign influence and her dishonesty and\nthe effects that it can have on her ability to safeguard classified information.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  \n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n9\nParagraph 2: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant's eligibility for a security\nclearance is granted.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nApplicant waived his right to 15 days notice.\n2\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated June 7, 2007.\n3\nGX 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated April 29, 2005).\n4\nId.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\n1\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nOn June 18, 2007 Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR allegations, and\nelected to have his case decided at a hearing. On July 11, 2007, the case was assigned to me. A\nNotice of Hearing was issued on July 24, 2007.  At the August 9, 2007 hearing, the Government\n2\nintroduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 into evidence without objections. Applicant\ntestified and introduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through E into evidence without objections from\nDepartment Counsel. DOHA received the transcript on August 20, 2007. At Applicant\u2019s request, I\nheld the record open until August 16, 2007. Applicant timely filed a document. This submission was\nmarked and entered into the record as AX F. Department Counsel had no objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e,1.f, and 1.k in\nhis SOR response under Guideline F. He did not deny the remaining allegations but did not know\nthe origin of the accounts.  After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due\n3\nconsideration, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He joined the United State Army\nin 1981. While in the military he received his GED in 1986. Applicant was honorably discharged in\n1992. After that, he served in the National Guard part time.

He has three children from\nhis first marriage who lived with their mother. After his divorce, Applicant paid child support in the\namount of $800 monthly.  Despite the fact that Applicant had health insurance coverage for his ex-\n6\nwife and the children, when a child was ill Applicant\u2019s ex-wife would take them to the emergency\nroom instead of a physician\u2019s office.  Applicant continued to pay for the additional medical bills as\n7\nwell as the first mortgage on the family home. As a result, he struggled financially and certain\nmedical bills remain unpaid. These are reflected in the SOR as allegations 1. c through 1. j. \nApplicant\u2019s wife, at the time of divorce agreed to keep her car and make the payments.\nHowever, after a period of time, she returned the car to Applicant. He paid on his wife\u2019s car for a\nperiod of time (even though the car was in her name), but he could not keep up the payments\nApplicant returned the car as a voluntary repossession (allegation 1.b).  He did not begin payments\n8\non the deficiency because his wife did not pay the second mortgage as she agreed and that amount\nwas garnished from his civil service pay. Thus, he had even less money to pay his bills. He has\ncompletely paid the second mortgage.  However, he had to prioritize his bills so that he could\n9\nmanage. He now stands ready to address this debt (1.b).\nApplicant applied for his current position in 2003, but at that time he did not need a security\nclearance for his work. He has successfully worked for the contractor for more than three years. As\npart of his security investigation, he was interviewed in 2006. He explained the nature of his debts,\nincluding a voluntary repossession of his wife\u2019s vehicle. However, he had no knowledge of some\nof the medical debts prior to the investigation. He has called the regional hospital to track down the\nunknown medical collection accounts. They referred him to a collection agency but then he reached\na dead end. He is still in the process of locating the accounts.10\nApplicant developed a repayment plan for his medical accounts. He now pays $50 monthly.\nThe amount goes to one collection agency which has the various medical accounts.  In addition, a\n11\nsum of $100 is automatically deducted monthly from his checking account for the debt alleged in\nSOR 1.k.12\nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that the alleged debt in SOR 1.l, is not listed under his\nname. He contacted the bank and they have no record of the account. Applicant\u2019s name and social\nsecurity number do not appear on any accounts from the bank. Department Counsel stated that the\n\nTr.19-20.\n13\nThis account does not have Applicant\u2019s name or social security number on it. Counsel agreed with that\n14\nstatement.\n5\nGovernment agrees with Applicant\u2019s response to the allegation. However, the allegation is not\namended.13\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s alleged debts listed in the SOR is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Account/ Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nPhysician (2006)\n     \n$27\nPAID\nAX A\n1.b\nAuto voluntary\nrepossession (2006)        \n$3,478\nUNPAID\nTr. 47; 68; 78.\n1.c\nMedical collection (2006)  \n$289\npayment plan $50\nAX D\n1.d\nMedical collection (2006)  \n $408\npayment plan \n(same as above)\nAX D\n1.e\nMedical collection (2006)  \n  $626\npayment plan\n(same as above)\nAX D\n1.f\nMedical collection (2005)  \n  $780\npayment plan\n(same as above)\nAX D\n1.g\nMedical collection (2005)  \n   $87\npayment plan\n(same as above)\nAX D\n1.h\nMedical collection (2005)  \n $385\npayment plan\n(same as above)\nAX D\n1.i\nMedical collection (2005)  \n  $91\npayment plan\n(same as above)\nAX D\n1.j\nMedical collection (2005)  \n  $102\npayment plan\n(same as above)\nAX D\n1.k\nCollection account (2006) \n$5,787\npayment plan $100\nAX B and C\n1.l\nCredit charge off (2001)    \n$4,406\nnot his account\nTr.19\n14\n1.m\nMedical collection (2004)\n$66\nunpaid unknown\naccount \nTr. 30\n\nAX E (Personal Financial Statement, dated August 2007).\n15\nAX F (Recommendation Letter from Logistics Department Manager).\n16\nId.\n17\nAX F (Letter from Business Manager).\n18\nId.\n19\nAX F (Performance Review 2007).\n20\n Department of the Navy v.

His child support payments ended two years ago. He is\npaying his debts according to his repayment plans. He is in the process of contacting the collection\nagency to negotiate a settlement for the car repossession.15\nApplicant\u2019s logistics manager praises his duty performance. He has found him to be\nstraightforward in his dealings with people, honest, knowledgeable of his duties, and a person of\nintegrity.  Applicant is an employee of the highest caliber.  Applicant received a letter of\n16\n17\nrecommendation and endorsement from the project manager with whom he has worked for four\nyears.  Applicant has a reputation for an outstanding work ethic, professionalism, and dedication\n18\nto doing a proper job. He was awarded a bonus for outstanding performance.  Applicant informed\n19\nhis management of the financial considerations concerns.  His business manager reports that\nApplicant has no violations of security procedures or protocols. His security manager reports that\nApplicant maintains the right attitude toward security related matters. In sum, he is recommended\nas a solid citizen who poses no security risk as a contractor employee. His latest performance\nevaluation (2007) rates Applicant as \u201cbetter than most.\u201d He is a key player and valued asset to the\ndepartment.20\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n21\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n22\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) 2 (a)(1)-(9).\n23\n Id.\n24\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n25\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n26\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n27\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n28\n7\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n22\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\n information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n23\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n24\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n25\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n26\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n27\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.28\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndeterminations as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n29\n8\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.29\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply in this case. Applicant acknowledged the delinquent debts and credit reports\nconfirm the various medical accounts and charged off accounts.\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20 (c) (the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/ or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or under control), FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts), and FC MC 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue).\nAG 20(a) does not provide a temporal or specific definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d\nconduct. The majority of Applicant\u2019s debts are in a payment plan. His overall conduct with his\ncreditors does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. While he\nshould have been more diligent, and made greater efforts to resolve his delinquent debts prior to 2006,\nhe has shown sufficient unusual circumstances to establish his financial problems are \u201cunlikely to\nrecur.\u201d Based upon my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude AG 20(a) partially\napplies because he currently has no new debt. His recent conduct is a strong indication that he will\navoid future delinquent debt. He no longer has child support payments and he and his wife are making\na substantial income with a monthly remainder to pay on his bills. His intent is to locate the unknown\nmedical accounts and pay them.\nApplicant disclosed some information to support application of AG 20 (b) and (c). His  former\nspouse\u2019s conduct contributed to his financial problems. She returned her vehicle to him, and since he\ncould not afford the payments he voluntarily returned the car. However, he now has to pay the\ndeficiency left after the sale of the car. She also did not pay the second mortgage as agreed, and the\n\n9\namount was garnished from Applicant\u2019s pay. Applicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of\nthis mitigating condition because he has received no financial counseling, and he did not act more\naggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. He failed to provide evidence showing\nhe maintained communication with his creditors over the years. However, there are some \u201cclear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d and he receives partial credit.\nAG 20(d) partially applies. He is current on his mortgage and car loan. He has no new\ndelinquent debt. He has a repayment plan for some of the medical debts and the collection account.\nWhile Applicant did not actually dispute the alleged debt in SOR 1.l, he explained at the hearing that\nhe called the bank and they had no information on the account. Department Counsel at the hearing\nagreed with Applicant in that the account does not have his name or social security number. Thus, AG\n20 (e) partially applies. However, he did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of\nthe dispute or provide evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d\n   \nThe issue is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of his outstanding debts,\nbut whether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances\nto warrant a favorable security determination.  Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns\nunder Guideline F.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant is a mature individual who suffered the consequences of a difficult\ndivorce. He provided for his three children and accepted many financial responsibilities after the\ndivorce. He has an exemplary work record. He also served honorably in the military. He has some\ndelinquent debt as a result of the divorce. Applicant has not spent above his means or been negligent\nor dishonest.\nApplicant was candid and straightforward at the hearing. He has a budget and a repayment\nplan. He is working diligently to locate unknown creditors. It must be noted that his financial\ndifficulties were in large measure a product of an unforseen circumstance. As to the voluntary\nrepossession of the car, Applicant prioritized his debts, and is now ready and able to address that\naccount. It is clear he has the means and intent to do so.\nMore importantly, it is unlikely that Applicant will experience such financial problems in the\nfuture. He is financially solvent. He lives well within his means and his demeanor reflects that he takes\nthis matter seriously and is in charge of his finances. I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns\nunder the financial considerations guideline.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

She has worked as a billing representative for the company since 1998, and moved to a position requiring a trustworthiness determination shortly before she submitted her SF 85P in May 2005. She was divorced from her first husband in 2002 after he was convicted of a felony and incarcerated. She married her present husband after submission of her SF 85P. In her Answer to the SOR, dated November 22, 2006, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o of the SOR, with explanations.

On October 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 2, 2006. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on November 22, 2006, and requested that her case be\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\nItem 2.\n1\nThe government submitted 11 items in support of the allegations.\n2\nItem 6 at 13.\n3\n2\ndecided by an Administrative Judge on the written record without a hearing.1\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on May 30, 2007. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant on\n2\nSeptember 10, 2007, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the document\nacknowledging receipt of her copy of the FORM on September 27, 2007, and returned\nit to DOHA. She provided no further response to the FORM within the 30-day period\nshe was given to do so, did not request additional time to respond, and made no\nobjection to consideration of any evidence submitted by Department Counsel. The case\nwas assigned to another Administrative Judge on November 9, 2007, and was\nreassigned to me on December 20, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked as\na billing representative for the company since 1998, and moved to a position requiring a\ntrustworthiness determination shortly before she submitted her SF 85P in May 2005.\nShe was divorced from her first husband in 2002 after he was convicted of a felony and\nincarcerated. She married her present husband after submission of her SF 85P. \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated November 22, 2006, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o of the SOR, with explanations. The\nfirst two allegations concern bankruptcies, and the last three involve unpaid medical\nbills, totaling $3,984, assigned for collection. She denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n1.c through 1.l, and 1.p through 1.r of the SOR. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. \nIn the two Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings, described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b,\nApplicant discharged $41,350 in debt in 1996, and another $40,798 in debt in 2003.\nThese debts resulted primarily from her former husband\u2019s serious medical condition, for\nwhich they had no insurance coverage, and the loss of his income after his\nincarceration. Applicant denied owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.I\nbecause she said they were discharged in her 2003 bankruptcy. Department Counsel\nagreed this was true concerning the debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h. The 2003\nbankruptcy creditor list in Item 11 confirms that the debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and 1.g\nwere also discharged. The creditor list does not include either the collection agent or\nthe original retail creditor for the $265 debt alleged in \u00b6 1.d, but the dates associated\nwith that debt support the contention that it was discharged. Furthermore, this debt is\nlisted on Appellant\u2019s June 2005 credit bureau report (CBR),  but not on her September\n3\n\nItem 7.\n4\nItem 8.\n5\nItem 6 at 10; Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 2.\n6\nItem 9.\n7\n3\n2006,  or January 2007,  CBRs. The record evidence does not establish that Applicant\n4\n5\nowed this debt as alleged in the SOR. \n The record does establish that Applicant owed the $769 debt as alleged in \u00b6 1.I\nof the SOR, contrary to her claim that it was also discharged in 2003. Neither the\ncollection agent nor the original creditor bank were listed on the Item 11 bankruptcy\ncreditor list, and the debt appears as undisputed and delinquent on all three record\nCBRs.  Applicant did not explicitly deny the two $76 delinquent medical bills alleged in\n6\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k, but simply denied being aware of them. They appear as undisputed\ndebts in collection on all three record CBRs, and Applicant submitted no evidence she\neither paid them or disputed the accuracy of the claims. In her SOR response,\nApplicant claimed that she paid the three medical bill collection accounts, totaling $306,\nand the $294 judgment debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.r, respectively. She\nprovided no proof of payment concerning any of these debts, and each of them\ncontinues to appear on her January 2007 CBR. Accordingly, all of those debts are also\nestablished by the record evidence. Combined with the debts to which she admitted,\nApplicant has ten unresolved delinquent debts totaling $5,505. Her personal financial\nstatement  shows about $200 per month in surplus income over regular expenses. \n7\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for .\n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.) \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n4\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision.\nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this\norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified\nor sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\n\n5\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated $5,500 in currently delinquent debt\nsince having discharged more than $82,000 in debt she could not afford to pay through\ntwo bankruptcy proceedings in the past 11 years. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@. Applicant\u2019s history of inability to pay her debts spans more than a decade,\nand continues to date. She provided no evidence this would not continue or recur, so\nthis mitigating condition is not supported by the record.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ All of Applicant=s\nfinancial problems that were caused, in whole or in part, by her first husband\u2019s medical\nissues and incarceration on a felony conviction were resolved by her two bankruptcy\ncases. She has incurred more than $5,500 in additional delinquent debt since then,\nwithout explanation or effort to document resolution. She has not demonstrated that this\npotentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case, except in\nmitigation of those former debts that were discharged in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy\nproceedings responsibly discharged all of her unpaid debt caused by her former\nhusband\u2019s problems, and do not, standing alone, raise trustworthiness concerns. They\ndo, however, provide historical context within which her more recent delinquent debts\nand financial irresponsibility must be evaluated.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ AG \u00b6 20(e) pertains to documentation of a legitimate basis to\ndispute the debts in question. Applicant documented neither financial counseling nor\nany effort to resolve or dispute her outstanding ten delinquent debts, totaling more than\n$5,500. None of these potentially mitigating conditions apply to reduce security\nconcerns arising from her present financial situation in light of her poor credit history\nand minimal solvency.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and\nexperienced financial employee who has had steady employment for almost ten years.\nDespite discharging more than $82,000 in unpaid debts through two bankruptcies in\n1996 and 2003, she again has more than $5,500 in delinquent debt and, at most, $200\nin monthly surplus income to address them. Even if she arranged to apply all of that\nsurplus to those debts, it would be more than two years before they were resolved. She\nhas made no effort to arrange resolution, however, demonstrating neither rehabilitation\nnor permanent behavioral changes. The potential for pressure from her creditors\nleading to exploitation of, or duress to misuse sensitive information is substantial,\nparticularly in light of recently toughened laws concerning repeated bankruptcy filings.\nHer ten-year pattern of significant financial delinquency makes continuation or\nrecurrence of financial irresponsibility more likely than not.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

He reduced\nhis marijuana use in September 1991 after a serious discussion with his father, and stopped\naltogether about three years ago.  He did not fully disclose the frequency and duration of his\nmarijuana use on his security clearance application and did not disclose regular use of ecstacy for\na three-month period.  Security concerns arising from his drug use have been mitigated, but his\nfalsification of his security clearance application was not refuted or mitigated.  Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).  The\nSOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 14, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 21, 2007, and heard on\nApril 24, 2007, as scheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 29-year-old network data communications analyst employed by a defense\ncontractor.  He is a college graduate and has a master\u2019s degree in network management (Tr. 51-52).\nHe has worked for his current employer since December 2002.  He has never held a permanent\nsecurity clearance.\nApplicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) on May 6, 2004 (Government\nExhibit (GX) 1).  In response to question 27, asking about use of any controlled substance, he\ndisclosed using marijuana \u201c10+\u201d times between January 1, 1996, and February 20, 2003. In the\nremarks section, he stated, \u201cdrug was marijuana.\u201d  He also explained, \u201cI can\u2019t recall the amount of\ntimes this has happened between the specified dates . . . my guess would be 10+ times.\u201d\nOn February 22, 2006, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), and he made substantially the same disclosures in response to the questions in\nSection 24, asking about illegal use of controlled substances (GX 2 at 27).  He testified he copied\nthe information on the SF 86 onto the e-QIP, except for one of the remarks at the end, with a few\nedits regarding previous residences (Tr. 55, 75-79).  He did not copy his previous explanatory remark\nabout drug use onto the e-QIP.\nApplicant was interviewed by a security investigator on April 24, 2006, about his drug\ninvolvement (GX 3).  He told the investigator under oath that he first used marijuana when he was\n14 or 15 years old, in 1991 or 1992, while on a trip to an amusement park.  He stated he took a\n\u201cdraw\u201d on a marijuana cigarette that was being passed around.  He stated he used marijuana daily\nfrom 1991 or 1992 until October 1998, when he stopped using it at the urging of his parents.  He\nstated he resumed using marijuana in October 1999 and used it at least weekly until December 2002,\nwhen he began working for his current employer and decided to decrease or discontinue using it.\n\n4\nHe told the investigator he used marijuana three to five times in both 2003 and 2004 and last used\nmarijuana in the fall of 2004.\nApplicant also told the investigator he used ecstasy for the first time in May 2000 while\nattending a concert with friends.  It made him sick the first time he used it, but it gave him a feeling\nof euphoria thereafter.  He admitted using ecstasy two or three times a month until July 2000.  He\ntold the investigator he spent about $10 to $20 per pill, but never sold or distributed them.\nApplicant acknowledged to the investigator that his security clearance applications did not\naccurately reflect his drug use.  He also acknowledged that he failed to list several residences on his\napplications.\nThe investigator testified that Applicant initially was vague about the frequency of his\nmarijuana use.  He testified \u201cwe had to go at it a little while\u201d before Applicant would be more\nspecific.  When Applicant said he used marijuana \u201cnumerous times,\u201d the investigator continued to\nprobe.  Finally, the investigator gave Applicant a piece of paper and told him to draw a time line\nshowing first use, high school use, college use, and frequency of use.  Even after drawing the time\nline, Applicant described his frequency as \u201cnumerous\u201d or \u201cseveral.\u201d  When the investigator again\ntold him he needed more specificity, Applicant disclosed daily use during high school.  The same\nkinds of multiple questions were required to determine his use in college (Tr. 30-33).  \nThe investigator testified Applicant was not certain when he last used marijuana, but after\nsome questioning admitted it was after he was hired by his current employer (Tr. 33).  When the\ninvestigator told Applicant he needed to be more specific and reminded him he was under oath,\nApplicant said his last use was in the fall of 2004 (Tr. 34).\nThe investigator asked Applicant if he had used any other drugs in addition to marijuana. \nInitially, Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d  Only after being asked several times did Applicant admit using\necstasy.  The investigator did not have the impression that Applicant\u2019s memory of using ecstasy was\ntriggered by the mention of other drugs.  His impression was that Applicant was hesitant to make\nfull disclosure of his drug use and that it was necessary to draw out the information by repeated\nquestions (Tr. 47-50).  Applicant told the investigator he filed out his application with the intention\nof making full disclosure during a follow-up interview with an investigator, but he could not recall\nthe precise extent of his marijuana use and was afraid to list an \u201cexorbitant\u201d number on his\napplication (GX 3 at 2).\nIn his answer to the SOR, he admitted a one-time use of marijuana in 1991, but he stated that\nhe purchased it rather than taking a draw of a cigarette being circulated among friends, as he had\nearlier told the security investigator.  He admitted daily use of marijuana from 1996 to 1998,\ndeviating from his earlier statement to the security investigator that his daily use began in 1991 or\n1992.  He admitted weekly use from 1999 to 2002.  He admitted using marijuana 3-5 times in 2003,\nbut did not mention using marijuana in 2004.  He specifically denied using marijuana after he\nexecuted his security clearance application in May 2004, and attributed his admission of using\nmarijuana up to the fall of 2004 to a suggestion by the interviewer.  Consistent with his statement\nto the investigator, he admitted using ecstasy 2-3 times a month from May to July 2000.  He denied\nfalsifying his two security clearance applications, attributing his omission of the 1991 marijuana use\nand his three-month period of ecstasy use to an oversight.\n\n5\nApplicant testified that he realized his current job offered a potential career about two months\nafter he was hired (Tr. 52).  In early 2003, he began working on his security clearance application.\nHe was unsure how to answer question 27, regarding his drug use, and he sought advice from a\nsecurity clearance specialist at his company.  He testified he had numerous conversations with the\nspecialist and may have e-mailed her once or twice.  According to Applicant, he told the specialist\nhe had used marijuana \u201ca lot.\u201d  She asked him, \u201chow many times is a lot, 10 or more?\u201d  He said\n\u201cyeah,\u201d and she said, \u201cthen that should be sufficient.\u201d  Applicant testified he told the security\ninvestigator he had sought advice about answering the question, even though it does not appear in\nthe investigator\u2019s report (Tr. 71-72).  \nApplicant admitted the dates of his marijuana use listed on his two applications were guesses\nand were inaccurate (Tr. 73-74).  He testified he knew there would be a follow-up interview after\nhe submitted his application, and he believed he would have an opportunity to provide the details\nof his marijuana use at that interview (Tr. 55).\nApplicant admitted he started using marijuana daily in 1994 or 1995, not 1996 as indicated\non his security clearance application.  He graduated from high school in 1996, and continued his\ndaily use until around September 2001.  His use then \u201ctapered off\u201d to weekly use until some time\nin 2002, when it went down to monthly use (Tr. 68-70).\nApplicant testified he incorrectly told the security investigator that he last used marijuana in\nthe fall of 2004.  He testified he knew he stopped smoking marijuana before he submitted his SF 86\nin May 2004, but he forgot that he started working on his application in the spring of 2003 and had\nalready stopped smoking marijuana by that time.  He testified he went to a New Year\u2019s party in 2003\nand had some marijuana left over from the party, which he consumed in February 2003 (Tr. 70).  He\ntestified he did not know why he neglected to copy the explanatory remark about his drug use when\nhe copied the other information from the SF 86 to the e-QIP (Tr. 79).\nApplicant testified he neglected to disclose his use of ecstasy on his SF 86 and the e-QIP\nbecause he \u201ccompletely forgot\u201d about it (Tr. 57).  He admitted the security investigator asked him\nmultiple times if he had used other drugs, but asserted he did not remember using ecstasy until the\ninvestigator recited examples of other drugs and specifically mentioned ecstasy (Tr. 58, 85).  He\ntestified his memory of using ecstasy \u201cbasically came back\u201d after he admitted using it (Tr. 86).  He\nremembered that his first use was at a concert with friends and that it made him sick enough to vomit\nin front of his friends (Tr. 88).\nApplicant testified that he stopped using marijuana because he did not want to risk his career.\nHe moved away from his old neighborhood, bought a house, starting focusing on his work, and\nstopped associating with his marijuana-using acquaintances, except for one lifelong friend who also\ndecided to stop using marijuana at about the same time (Tr. 61-62).  He now socializes with his co-\nworkers and supervisors (Tr. 64-66).\nOne of Applicant\u2019s supervisors has noticed his increasing maturity and growth over the last\nyear and a half, and he believes Applicant\u2019s character and work ethic are impeccable (AX A).  A\nlifelong friend believes he has relegated his drug use to the past, and there is nothing else in his past\nthat would raise questions about his trustworthiness, honest, or reliability (AX B).  Another\nsupervisor who has known Applicant from the beginning of his current employment testified that\n\n6\nApplicant is frugal, very hard-working, and mature.  He recommended Applicant for transfer to a\nclassified position because he admired his integrity, morals, character, and honesty (Tr. 95-97).\nApplicant\u2019s father is an Air Force veteran and a successful businessman who has been\nmarried to Applicant\u2019s mother for almost 38 years.  He testified that he and Applicant had a serious\ndiscussion in September 2001 about the direction of Applicant\u2019s life.  The discussion covered\nApplicant\u2019s misgivings about his upcoming marriage, his drug use, his excessive credit card debt,\nand his substandard academic performance.  They talked, prayed together, and agreed on a plan to\nredirect Applicant\u2019s life.  Applicant terminated his engagement to be married.  His father lent him\nabout $20,000 to get out of debt, which Applicant repaid within three years. Applicant began\nattending church again.  When Applicant decided to apply for a security clearance, his father told\nhim, \u201cthey\u2019re going to ask you about everything,\u201d and he advised Applicant to leave nothing out and\nnot to \u201csugarcoat\u201d his answers (Tr. 101-106).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\n\n7\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24.  \u201cDrugs\u201d include \u201c[d]rugs, materials,\nand other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 24(a)(1).  Drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that\ndeviates from approved medical direction.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24(b).\nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include \u201cany drug abuse\u201d and \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 25(a) and (c).  The evidence in this case establishes\nthese two disqualifying conditions.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving\nit is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 26(a).  The first clause of \u00b6 26(a) (\u201chappened so long ago\u201d) focuses\non the recency of drug involvement.  There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct\nis \u201crecent.\u201d  The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the evidence.  ISCR Case\nNo. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has\npassed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether\nthat period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding\nof reform or rehabilitation.\u201d  Id.  Although the evidence is conflicting on when Applicant last used\nmarijuana, it is clear his last use was no later than the fall of 2004, almost three years ago.  There is\nno evidence of physical or psychological addiction.  His significant changes in lifestyle strongly\nsuggest reform or rehabilitation.  I conclude this mitigating condition is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by evidence of \u201ca demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and\ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; [or] (3) an appropriate\nperiod of abstinence.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 26(b)(1)-(3).  During his interview with the security investigator,\n\n8\nApplicant asserted his intention to abstain from drugs in the future.  He has demonstrated that intent\nby moving to a new neighborhood, cutting off his association with drug users, and abstaining from\ndrugs for a significant period.  He is employed in a position that offers him a rewarding career, and\nhis abstinence from drugs is motivated by his desire to not put his career at risk.  I conclude this\nmitigating condition is established.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 15.  The\nrelevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 16(a).\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  An omission or misstatement, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when it occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission or misstatement.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5\n(App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nThere are two aspects of Applicant\u2019s drug use at issue under this guideline.  The first is his\nfailure to accurately describe the frequency and duration of his drug use, and the second is his failure\nto disclose his use of ecstasy.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his first use of marijuana in 1991 on either of his two\napplications does not raise a security concern because it occurred more than seven years before he\nexecuted his applications and before he was 16 years old, making it outside the scope of question\n27.  Similarly, his statement on both applications that his marijuana use began in January 1996 is\nexplainable by reference to the seven-year limit for question 27. However, his conflicting\ndescriptions of his first use and the duration of his daily use are relevant to evaluating his credibility.\nThere are numerous conflicts in his descriptions of his marijuana use.  He told the security\ninvestigator his daily use of marijuana began in 1991 or 1992, but he stated in his answer to the SOR\nthat it began in 1996, and he testified at the hearing that it began in 1994 or 1995, while he was still\nin high school.  He told the investigator his daily use ended in October 1998, and he provided the\nsame end date in his answer to the SOR, but he testified at the hearing that his daily use continued\nuntil 2002.  Finally, he stated on both his applications that he last used marijuana in February 2003,\nbut he told the investigator his last use was in the fall of 2004.  At the hearing, he repudiated his\nstatement to the investigator setting the ending date in the fall of 2004, and insisted his last use was\nin February 2003.\n\n9\nApplicant\u2019s statement to the investigator and his answer to the SOR suggest an effort to\nunderstate the duration of his daily use and make it more remote in time.  His statement on the\napplication that he used marijuana \u201c10+\u201d times may have been numerically true, but it was not\ncandid.  It did not come close to disclosing daily use for nine years.  Applicant is intelligent and well\neducated.  He knew his marijuana use was an obstacle to his career plans.  He undoubtedly knew that\ndaily use for nine years was a much greater obstacle to obtaining a clearance than \u201c10+\u201d uses over\na seven-year period.  He knew that the \u201cremarks\u201d section of the application would allow him to\nclarify or expand an answer, and he used the remarks section on both applications, but he made no\neffort to explain his \u201c10+\u201d answer.  It was only after persistent and repeated questioning by an\nexperienced investigator that Applicant reluctantly admitted daily use.  \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing was articulate and responsive.  He did not appear timid\nor easily intimidated.  To the contrary, he briefly questioned Department Counsel\u2019s knowledge of\nthe security clearance application process during her cross-examination (Tr. 77-78).  I find his\nassertion that he did not know how to articulate the frequency of his marijuana use disingenuous, in\nlight of his level of education, obvious intelligence, and demeanor during his testimony.  I conclude\nthat Applicant\u2019s answer to question 27 was intentionally deceptive regarding the duration and\nfrequency of his marijuana use.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his use of ecstasy must be evaluated in the context of his\ncontradictory statements and reluctance to admit the full extent of his drug use.  I find his claim of\nfaulty memory implausible and unbelievable.  His explanation that his memory was triggered by the\ninvestigator\u2019s litany of other drugs does not take into account that question 27 lists numerous other\ndrugs.  The specificity of his description of the venue and circumstances of his use, the price he paid\nfor the pills, and his nauseous reaction to the drug belies a faulty memory.  The fact that his first use\nwas embarrassing, causing him to vomit in the presence of his friends at a public concert, makes his\nclaim of faulty memory implausible.  I conclude Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his use of\necstasy in response to question 27.  Based on the above considerations, I conclude the disqualifying\ncondition in Guidelines \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.\nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance application\nmay be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 17(a).\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to correct his omission and misleading answers were neither prompt nor entirely\nin good faith.  He executed his SF 86 in May 2004, repeated his answers in his e-QIP in February\n2006, and made no effort to correct the information until he was interviewed in April 2006.  Even\nthen, he provided correct information only after repeated prodding and cajoling by the investigator.\nThe mitigating condition in Guidelines \u00b6 17(a) is not established.\nSecurity concerns based on false or misleading answers also may be mitigated by showing\nthat \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising\nor instructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and\ntruthfully.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 17(b).  Applicant claimed his disclosure of \u201c10+\u201d instances of using\nmarijuana was based on advice from a security clearance specialist.  His claim is uncorroborated by\n\n10\ntestimony, statements, or affidavits, even though he was aware of and utilized affidavits as a\nsubstitute for live testimony.  Even if such advice was given, it would have been the product of faulty\nand misleading information provided by Applicant.  There is no evidence he told the specialist he\nused marijuana daily.  He only told her he used it \u201ca lot,\u201d and ten uses of marijuana would, in\nordinary parlance, be \u201ca lot.\u201d  He is well-educated, intelligent, and very articulate, and he admitted\nat the hearing that his disclosure of using marijuana more than ten times in a seven-year period did\nnot accurately describe daily use for nine years.  His explanation that he knew he would have an\nopportunity to clarify his answer in a follow-up interview is belied by the reluctance and evasiveness\nhe displayed during that interview.  I conclude that Guidelines \u00b6 17(b) is not established.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Guidelines\n\u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  Several of these factors were incorporated in the above discussions of Guidelines H\nand E, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant engaged in serious lawbreaking for a substantial portion of his life, starting as an\nadolescent and continuing past college.  The turning point in his life appears to have been the heart-\nto-heart discussion with his father in September 2001, because he started reducing his drug use\nshortly thereafter.  His motivation for cessation of his drug use does not appear to be based on health\nreasons or a newly-discovered respect for the law, but fear of losing his job.  Now that he has finally\nmade full disclosure of his drug use, the potential for coercion, exploitation, or duress is nil.  He\nappears to be content with his \u201cclean\u201d life, making the likelihood of recurrence low.\nApplicant\u2019s deceptive security clearance applications are another matter.  Absolute honesty\nand candor are expected of persons entrusted with classified materials. Willingness and a\npredisposition to self-report breaches of security, even at the risk of detriment to reputation and\ncareer, are essential.  Applicant\u2019s lack of candor is a serious disqualification.\n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated\nthe security concerns based on drug involvement, but he has not mitigated the concerns based on\npersonal conduct.  Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

He has five\nalleged debts listed in the statement of reasons (SOR) totaling approximately $25,000. One of the\ndebts was paid in 2004.  He began a debt repayment plan in 2007 for the others.

His debt problems resulted from periods of unemployment.\nFor the last two years he has shown his financial responsibility by not generating any new delinquent\ndebt. Applicant has mitigated security concerns arising under financial considerations. Clearance is\ngranted. \n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 1, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On January 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed\nreasons why, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nrevised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the\nSOR on February 23, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on April 11, 2007. I scheduled a hearing for May 9, 2007. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on May 9, 2007 to evaluate whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Five\nGovernment Exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted. Applicant's one exhibit (AE A) was admitted into the\nrecord without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, as reflected in the hearing transcript\n(Tr.) received on May 18, 2007. At Applicant's request I held the record open for a post hearing\nsubmission. On May 16, 2007, he submitted two letters of reference and a statement concerning one\nof his debts (AE B, C, and D). On June 1, 2007, Applicant submitted a final document (AE E). The\ndocuments were admitted into the record without objection and the record closed.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nApplicant's response to the SOR, dated February 23, 2007.\n1\nTr.16. \n2\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated April 1, 2005) at 1-13.\n3\nTr. 15.\n4\nTr.16.\n5\nTr.32.\n6\nTr.62.\n7\nTr.50.\n8\n4\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR, \u00b6 1.d and 1.e are incorporated herein.\nHe denied allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f because he paid some of the accounts.  In addition, after\n1\na thorough and careful review of the evidence and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 29-year-old computer technician working for a defense contractor. He is\nengaged to be married in June 2007. Also, he has one child from a previous relationship born in\n2000.  He has no military experience. Applicant earned a General Equivalency Diploma (GED) in\n2\n1999. He completed an application for a security clearance on April 1, 2005.3\nWhen he initially finished his high school education, Applicant worked with various\ncontractors. He would work for three to four months and be laid off for perhaps two months before\nanother contract would begin. This uneven employment led to financial difficulties. In 2001,\nApplicant received his first full time government position. At that time he did not need a security\nclearance.4\nDuring his work with the government, he again found himself subject to the vagaries of\ncontract work.  His longest period of unemployment was generally two months. In 2001-2002, he\nwas unemployed a couple of weeks at a time twice. When he was laid off, his bills could not be paid\nin full. In addition, he learned about four years ago that he is the father of a seven-year old girl. He\nengaged in a custody battle and incurred approximately $15,000 for legal fees.  Applicant now has\n5\npartial custody.6\nAs Applicant struggled to pay his bills, he took part time work to supplement his income. At\ntimes he worked several part time jobs. He used personal loans at first to establish a credit rating,\nbut when he became unemployed at various times, he used credit for daily expenses including a cell\nphone. In 2002, he purchased a car and made payments on the vehicle until he defaulted in March\n2003. He did a voluntary repossession.  Originally, his father cosigned the car loan, but his father\n7\nlost his job and filed for bankruptcy in 2004. Initially Applicant believed the bankruptcy voided his\nliability.  Applicant then used a personal loan to pay for the car.8\nSince January 2005, he has been employed with his current defense contractor. He paid off\nsome bills and is earning a stable income. As to the debts in the SOR, 1.a is the same as 1.e.\n\nAE A; Tr. 40.\n9\nId.\n10\nTr.37.\n11\n5\nApplicant settled the debt for $258.35 in May 2007.  Applicant paid the debt 1.b (cable) of $277 in\n9\nFebruary 2004 and December 2006.  Debt 1.c was transferred to a collection company. Applicant\n10\nsettled by paying $859 with a money order in 1998. It still appears on his credit report and he has\ncalled repeatedly to have the collection company take care of the matter. About four months ago,\nApplicant contacted a credit reporting company to again request assistance in deleting this amount\nfrom his credit report.  Applicant is in repayment status with debt 1.d since January 2007. This is\n11\n\nAE C.\n12\nAE B.(Character References, dated May 2007).\n13\nGE 5 (Personal Financial Statement, dated November 13, 2006) at 1.\n14\nTr. 71.\n15\nTr. 78.\n16\n6\na personal loan  with a balance of $4,102. He pays $110 a month through an automatic checking\naccount withdrawal and is current in his payments.12\nThe largest debt ( a judgement) is for $13,000 to an automobile company. His father included\nthis car in his 2004 bankruptcy. However, this did not discharge Applicant's liability. He learned\nabout this approximately one year ago. He asked for a hearing, but never received notice. On March\n13, 2007, his credit union advised him that a Writ of Garnishment was issued on February 22, 2007.\nTo date Applicant's $6,375.40 in his credit union savings account has been frozen for payment\ntoward that debt. Applicant contacted a lawyer as soon as he learned about the judgement. Currently,\nhe is attempting to settle this obligatoin out of court with the company. Applicant is willing to pay\nthe remainder of the debt. He has repeatedly contacted the auto company to reach a settlement.\nApplicant's current employer praises him as an intelligent and motivated individual. He is\nrated as above average on his annual reviews. He has made consistent contributions to the company\nin his three years as a lead installer. He has been exposed to highly classified materials without\nincident. His peers regard him as a valuable team member.  \n13\nApplicant earns approximately $2,000 net a month.  His fiancee has a net monthly income\n14\nof $1,400.  He pays monthly child support in the amount of $178. He does not have a car loan. After\n15\nhis monthly expenses, his net monthly remainder is $800.  He is current on his corporate credit card\n16\nby paying the balance each month. He is financially stable. He has a 401 (k) account. However, as\nstated above, his savings account was garnished without his knowledge in the amount of $6375.40.\nHis two delinquent debts are being resolved. He accepts responsibility for paying his debts.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth set forth both disqualifying conditions\nand mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts\nand circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation, (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct, (4) the individual's age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct, (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary, (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes. (7) the motivation for the conduct, (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.

The government\n17\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n18\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n19\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n20\ndecision.21\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n22\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n23\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n24\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n25\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Based upon\nconsideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F of the revised AG most pertinent to the evaluation\nof the facts in this case. That guideline reads in pertinent part:\n\n AG \u00b6 18.\n26\n8\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.26\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued five\ndelinquent debts since 2000. He admits there are still two outstanding debts and he was slow to pay\nthese bills. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC), AG \u00b6 19(a),\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC, AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Several incidents occurred\nin Applicant' s life which led to periods of unemployment and employment instability. Such\nconditions (outside his control) contributed to Applicant's acquisition of delinquent debt. He never\nquestioned the legitimacy of the debts. However, he did believe that his father's 2004 bankruptcy\nrelieved him of the debt owed to the auto company. He became more active in pursing his debts after\nhe was in steady employment with his current employer. Therefore, FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(b), (the\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC), \u00b6 AG 20(a), (the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does\napply in part due to his continuing repayment and settlement efforts.\nWhile Applicant has not received financial counseling, he paid two accounts in full and is\nnegotiating a settlement on the judgement. FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/ or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control) does apply to some extent.\nIn the past years, Applicant was not always in a position to resolve his debt. He attempted to\npay his bills until his unemployment. Therefore, FC MC, \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies to a small degree.\nThe issue is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of his outstanding debts,\nbut whether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances\nto warrant a favorable security clearance decision. His remaining unpaid debt does not constitute a\nsecurity risk. In 2007, he began repayment of his other delinquent debts. Due to the nature and timing\nof the judgment against him, he has not totally resolved that debt.\n\n9\nWhole Person Analysis.\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. He\nis an earnest, young man who at the hearing acknowledged that living within ones means and\nsatisfying debts, as well as meeting financial obligations, is imperative to demonstrate good\njudgement and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. He realized the financial delinquencies\nwould be considered a negative. He is open, honest and has not hidden the situation. He firmly\nbelieves he is handling his debt properly at this point. He admits that he made mistakes when younger.\nHe has not incurred any other delinquent debt in two years. His financial circumstances have greatly\nimproved. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low. He is current on his\npresent financial obligations, and has a very positive employment history since 2005. His greater\nawareness of financial responsibilities will result in a continuously improving trend of financial\ncircumstances.\nIn sum, the likelihood of new debt problems is low. Applicant's financial case shows his\nwillingness to utilize his repayment plan to resolve his delinquent debts. After weighing the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the\nwhole person, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.\nClearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

He has, however, mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns under allegation 1.b of Guideline F and Guideline E. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the\nSOR sets forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the\ncase be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked. On December 11, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to\nthe allegations. He requested a decision on the record.\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided Applicant\nwith a complete copy on April 20, 2007. Applicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file\nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response\nor additional evidence. This case was assigned to me on June 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegation under subparagraph 1.a of Guideline F in the SOR.  This\n1\nadmission is incorporated as a finding of fact. He denied the remaining allegations.  After a complete\n2\nreview of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant, who is 63-years-old, works as an electronic technician for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He has held this position for over three years. He submitted an application for\na security clearance (SF-86) in September 2005.3\n\nId. at 2-12. His SF-86 does not request information for residences and employment beyond the last seven years.\n4\nThe SOR indicates that this lien was filed on or about May 2004. Applicant\u2019s October 8, 2005 credit report\n5\nshows the status of the lien as unknown in May 2004. The credit report does not show the date that IRS filed this lien\nor the type of property on which the IRS filed the lien. Item 4 (Credit report, dated October 8, 2005) at 2.\nId.; Item 5 (Credit report, dated September 25, 2006) at 1; Item 6 (Credit report, dated April 18, 2007) at 1.\n6\nItem 1, supra note 3, at 23.\n7\nId.; Item 3, supra note 1, at 2.\n8\n3\nApplicant was born in State A. He married in 1984 in State B. His two daughters, age 22 and\n19, reside in State B. His residences listed on his SF-86 reflect that he has resided in State B for the\nlast nine years at least. His SF-86 indicates that he has worked in State B for the last nine years. His\nmother, brother and sisters reside in State B. The three individuals listed as knowing him well for\nthe last 37 to 49 years reside in State B.4\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien, date unknown, in the amount of $14,345,\nwhich Applicant acknowledges. He admitted that the lien is not paid and stated that he will work\nwith a lawyer to remedy. The evidence of record did not indicate what type of property, real or\npersonal, was the subject of the IRS lien.  His credit reports reflected a tax lien filed by State C at\n5\nsome point in time prior to August 1999. Applicant denied any knowledge of this lien. The status\nof this lien is shown as unknown as of August 1999.6\nOn September 26, 2005, Applicant completed his security clearance application. He answered\n\u201cno\u201d to the following question:7\nSection 27: Your Financial Record - Question c:\nIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property\nfor failing to pay taxes or other debts?\nApplicant denied that he intentionally falsified his answer to this question, stating that he has no\nproperty nor has ever owned any property. This question did not define the meaning of the word\n\u201cproperty\u201d.8\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\n\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n9\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n10\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n11\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The government\n10\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n11\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n12\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n13\nclearance decision.14\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n15\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n16\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n17\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n18\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\n\nApplicant should challenge the validity of this debt and request its removal from his credit report.\n19\n5\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individuals\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18.) Applicant has a significant overdue federal tax\ndebt, which has been unpaid for a number of years. Based on the evidence of record, DC \u00b6 19 (a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations, apply to allegation 1.a in the SOR. Because the evidence of record does not show the\nbasis for the IRS lien (failure to file a tax return or failure to pay all taxes due and owing on a filed\nreturn), DC \u00b6 19 (g) failure to file annual Federal, state or local income tax returns \u2026 cannot be\napplied in this case.\nI have reviewed all the mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 20 (a)-(f) and conclude that\nnone of them apply because the Applicant has not paid his IRS debt, and has not provided any\nevidence about this debt, including how it occurred, any contacts with the IRS to pay the debt, or any\ncounseling services. Allegation 1.a is found against the Applicant.\nHowever, the government has not established its case as to allegation 1.b. Although the State\nC tax lien is listed in Applicant\u2019s credit report, this fact is insufficient by itself to establish the\ngovernment\u2019s case in light of his denial of any knowledge of the lien. Credit reports often contain\nincorrect information. Applicant was born in State A and some time later, probably as a child, moved\nto State B. The evidence of record reflects that his entire family lives in State B, that he was married\nalmost 23 years ago in State B, that for the last more than nine years, he has lived in State B, and that\nfor the last nine years, he has worked in State B. The record contains no evidence that he ever lived\nor worked in State C or other affirmative evidence that the credit report information is correct. Given\nhis numerous and lengthy contacts with State B, the listed tax debt is most likely the result of an\nerror by the credit reporting agency.  Allegation 1.b under Guideline F is found in favor of\n19\nApplicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15) Under DC \u00b6 16 (a), the\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted a material fact from his SF-86 when he answered\n\u201cno\u201d to question c in Section 27. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to this\nquestion. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving\nit. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n20\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n6\nintent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) deliberate omission,\n20\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire . . . to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment\nor falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nApplicant interpreted the word \u201cproperty\u201d to mean real property. His interpretation is not\nunreasonable since the word \u201cproperty\u201d is not defined in his SF-86, and the average individual talks\nabout property ownership in terms of real property. Property can also include personal property such\nas bank accounts, stocks, earned wages, or a car. The IRS can lien personal property as well as real\nproperty. In this case, the property against which the IRS filed a lien for payment of taxes is not\nidentified. I find that Applicant did not intentionally falsify his answer to question c in Section 27\nbecause he reasonably interpreted the question to mean real property, which he has not and does not\nown. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests. \nApplicant has a significant unpaid tax lien. He has not done anything to resolve this debt.\nBecause he has not made any efforts to pay this debt and has not provided any evidence as to why\nthis tax lien exists, he has not provided a basis to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns. His\nfailure to pay or resolve his federal tax debt is not outweighed by the remaining favorable findings.\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant a security clearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a: \n      Against Applicant\nSubparagraph b: \n      For Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2-Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a: \n      For Applicant\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Accordingly, I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact. She is a 27-year-old software developer for a defense contractor, and seeks access to classified information. She previously had a confidential clearance when she worked in support of the Drug Enforcement Administration in August 2003. During the pendency of this clearance application, she held an interim secret clearance without incident from July 2005 until the SOR was issued in April 2007. Applicant\u2019s parents were Nigerian citizens attending college in the U.S. in the mid-1970s when her brother (September 1972) and sister (October 1976) were born. After receiving their undergraduate degrees, they remained in the U.S. while Applicant\u2019s father completed his master\u2019s degree, then returned to Nigeria.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated  2\n1\nJanuary 1992\u2014as amended and modified, most recently in August 2006 (Directive).\n2\nThe government\u2019s evidence failed to establish that Applicant was at heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of her limited family\nconnections to Nigeria. Clearance granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 23 April 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of\nunresolved foreign influence concerns.  She answered the SOR in an undated answer, received by\n1\nDOHA 10 May 2007, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 11 June 2007 and I\nconvened a hearing 12 July 2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 20 July 2007.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for denying that she had a Nigerian\nboyfriend (SOR, 1.d.) and correcting her dates of travel to Nigeria (SOR 1.f.). Accordingly, I\nincorporate those admissions as findings of fact. She is a 27-year-old software developer for a\ndefense contractor, and seeks access to classified information. She previously had a confidential\nclearance when she worked in support of the Drug Enforcement Administration in August 2003.\nDuring the pendency of this clearance application, she held an interim secret clearance without\nincident from July 2005 until the SOR was issued in April 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s parents were Nigerian citizens attending college in the U.S. in the mid-1970s\nwhen her brother (September 1972) and sister (October 1976) were born. After receiving their\nundergraduate degrees, they remained in the U.S. while Applicant\u2019s father completed his master\u2019s\ndegree, then returned to Nigeria. However, they were so taken with life in the U.S. that they returned\nto the U.S. for the birth of Applicant (January 1980) and her younger sister (October 1985). All her\nsiblings now live in the U.S., as do her parents. Her brother served in the U.S. military, and her sister\nis employed with the federal government and holds a top secret/special compartmented information\nclearance.\nApplicant\u2019s father worked for the Nigerian central bank (the Nigerian equivalent of the U.S.\nFederal Reserve Bank) as a director of banking operations until the late 1990s, when he retired. He\nreceived a lump sum retirement payment from the central bank when he retired. Applicant\u2019s mother\nworked as a geo-scientist for a major U.S. oil company until she took early retirement in the mid-\n1990s, from which she receives a small company pension. Applicant\u2019s mother became a naturalized\nU.S. citizen in March 2006. Applicant\u2019s father is a legal permanent resident (LPR) of the U.S., and\nintends to apply for his U.S. citizenship as soon as he is eligible. Applicant\u2019s parents reside with one\nof her sisters when they are in the U.S., but currently reside about half the year in Nigeria because\nof the health and medical needs of Applicant\u2019s 95-year-old grandmother.\n\n3\nApplicant traveled to the U.S. in December 1995\u2014during her senior year in high school\u2014to\nlook at colleges. She returned to Nigeria and completed high school in June 1996, when she came\nto the U.S. to attend college and live in the U.S. permanently as a U.S. citizen. Since arriving in the\nU.S. to stay, she has been continually employed, either full- or part-time. She attended a local\ncommunity college from January 1997 to May 1999, when she transferred to a major U.S. university.\nShe obtained her undergraduate degree in computer science in December 2002. Applicant has\nsignificant financial assets in the U.S., none in Nigeria. She bought a $340,000 condominium in July\n2005, putting more than $37,000 down. In January 2007, she accepted a position with a new\nemployer paying her $85,000 per year.\nApplicant traveled to Nigeria in 2000 to visit her family. She also traveled to Nigeria in 2003\nas the maid-of-honor for her sister, who decided to have a destination wedding in Nigeria. For both\ntrips, she was required to obtain a tourist visa from the Nigerian Embassy to enter Nigeria (G.E. 2).\nApplicant\u2019s aunts, uncles, and cousins are all citizens and residents of Nigeria. She did not have that\nmuch contact with them when she lived in Nigeria, and has had no contact with them since she\nmoved to the U.S., except for brief contact on her two return trips to Nigeria.\nNigeria\u2014a part of the British Empire first as a sphere of British influence in 1885, then as\na colony and protectorate in 1914\u2014was granted independence from the United Kingdom in October\n1960. Since independence, the government has experienced multiple periods of political unrest,\nincluding military takeovers of the government. However, the military has generally ceded power\nback to civilian government, most recently in May 1999. Although Nigeria has a poor human rights\nrecord, it has been a staunch supporter of the U.S. global war on terrorism. Furthermore, since\nindependence Nigerian foreign policy has been characterized by a focus on Africa and adherence to\nseveral fundamental principles: African unity and independence; peaceful settlement of disputes;\nnonalignment and nonintentional interference in the internal affairs of other nations; and regional\neconomic cooperation and development. Nigeria is the largest U.S. trading partner in sub-Saharan\nAfrica, and the U.S. is second only to the United Kingdom in trade with Nigeria. The U.S. is the\nlargest foreign investor in Nigeria. Nigeria is not a known collector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive\neconomic information. Nigeria is not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information.\nThe U.S. Department of State characterizes the foreign relations between the U.S. and Nigeria as\nexcellent.\nOne of Applicant\u2019s former supervisors testified how extremely trustworthy he found her over\nthe more-than-three years he supervised her, a sentiment that was echoed in her character references\nfrom other employers (A.E. D). In addition, she has never had a security violation.\nPOLICIES AND BURDENS\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\n4\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests may\nraise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, 2) may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ncontrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign\ninfluence adjudications can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information requires\n3\ncareful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected information,\nand to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the individual\u2019s\nsusceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts\nwith foreign family members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if\nthose contacts create a heightened risk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.4\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline B.\nConsidering the country side of the equation first, Nigeria and the U.S. enjoy excellent foreign\nrelations. However, while Nigeria focuses its foreign policy largely in the region, it has actively\ncooperated with the U.S. in ending global terrorism. Nigeria is not known to target protected U.S.\ninformation, nor is it known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. Further, in this\n\n5\ncase it is not clear what claim Nigeria might have on Applicant. There is no evidence that she was\nconsidered to be a Nigerian citizen, and indeed, she had to apply to the Nigerian government for a\ntourist visa to travel to Nigeria. The risk that Nigeria might seek protected information from\nApplicant is low, if not non-existent.\nOn the Applicant side of the equation, the government produced no evidence that there was\nany risk, much less a heightened risk, of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion because of Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in Nigeria. Applicant was born a U.S.\ncitizen, and although she resided with her parents in Nigeria until she finished high school, her first\nimportant decision as an adult was to move to the U.S. permanently. Her financial and family\nconnections are all in the U.S.: her siblings (and her nephews) all live in the U.S. All are U.S.\ncitizens. Her mother is a U.S. citizen; her father is an LPR of the U.S. on track for U.S. citizenship.\nThey reside in the U.S. permanently, except when in Nigeria caring for Applicant\u2019s 95-year-old\ngrandmother. There is nothing in the circumstances of their being in Nigeria, or in Applicant\u2019s\ncontacts with her parents and grandmother, to heighten the risk that she could be impelled to provide\nprotected information to Nigeria. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n   Paragraph 1.

TUIDER\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified.  Concerning the security guidelines, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005.  The revised guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006.  They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix\n8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.  They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued\non September 1, 2006 or thereafter, and they apply to this case because the SOR is dated February 22, 2007.  Both the\nDirective and the Regulation are pending formal amendment.\n2\nApplicant is unable to mitigate financial considerations concerns that arose following the\nsubmission of her security clearance application that identified outstanding debts exceeding\n$20,000.00.  She sought chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and is awaiting receipt of her bankruptcy\ndischarge.  She has yet to establish a budget and a financial track record establishing financial\nresponsibility.  Clearance is denied.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On February 22, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 21, 2007, and\nelected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nDepartment Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on April 11, 2007, and the case was\nassigned to me on April 13, 2007.  On April 26, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling\nthe case to be heard on May 16, 2007. The case was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nAt the hearing, the government presented six exhibits, which were marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6, and admitted without objection.  Applicant did not present any exhibits.\nDOHA received the transcript on May 25, 2007.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a\nthorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 34-year-old executive assistant, who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since August 1990, accumulating over 16 years of employment with the same company.\nShe began her employment with her company shortly after she graduated from high school in June\n1990.  She seeks reinstatement of her clearance, which was suspended as a result of these\nproceedings.  \n\n3\nApplicant is unmarried and mother of three children, a 12-year-old son, a 5-year-old\ndaughter, and a 3-year-old son.  The father of her oldest son does not currently pay child support\nbecause of their recent  joint custody arrangement.  The father of her daughter and youngest son pays\nintermittent and erratic child support.  The father of her oldest child lives nearby and is involved in\ntheir daughter\u2019s life.  The father of her son and youngest daughter lives in another state and is not\ninvolved in the lives their children. \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is in arrears on 18 debts exceeding $20,000.00 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.\nthrough 1.r.).  Applicant recently filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy on March 15, 2007, and all of the\ndebts alleged in the SOR are included on her Schedule F - Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority\nClaims.  Applicant\u2019s unsecured debts listed on her Schedule F total $40,973.53.  GE 6.  She\nestimates she will be granted her discharge in July 2007.  Tr. 44.\nApplicant attributes her financial difficulties to lack of child support, uncovered medical\nexpenses for her children and herself, and \u201cbad judgment.\u201d  Tr. 45-47.  She also underwent credit\ncounseling as a requirement of filing bankruptcy.  Tr. 44-45.  When Applicant received her\ndischarge, she plans to prepare a budget and attempt to rebuild her credit with the assistance of her\nbankruptcy attorney.  Tr. 47.  She has also applied for low income housing to lower her housing\ncosts.  Tr. 49.\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.\nInstead, they are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making\noverall common sense determinations, administrative judges must consider, assess, and analyze the\nevidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant adjudicative\nguidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government\nhas the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a\nnexus to an applicant\u2019s lack of security worthiness.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, the President has\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified\ninformation to \u201cUnited States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively\n\n4\nindicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability,\ndiscretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for\ncoercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and\nprotection of classified information.\u201d  Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information \u00a7\n3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting\nthe security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is\nrequired is proof of facts and circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts\nproven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness,\nthen the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial\nevidence in explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite\nthe existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance. \nSecurity clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto do so.\u201d  See Executive Orders 10865 \u00a7 2 and 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b). \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2 \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\nDoubts are to be resolved against the applicant.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, a security concern arises by:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds.  \nThe government established its case under Guideline F by Applicant\u2019s admissions and\nevidence submitted establishing she had 18 delinquent debts exceeding $20,000.00.  These facts give\nrise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 18(a) inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts; and FC DC 18(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant accumulated substantial debt over a lengthy period of time.  Her situation was no\ndoubt exacerbated by shortfalls in child support and uncovered medical bills.  However, I have also\nnoted Applicant\u2019s admission that her problems were also caused by exercising \u201cbad judgment.\u201d  This\n\n5\nis further demonstrated by the fact her SOR identified only $20,000.00 of her unsecured debt in\ncontrast her Schedule F, which listed unsecured debt exceeding $40,000.00.\nApplicant\u2019s situation deteriorated to the point she sought bankruptcy as her remedy.\nAlthough, she is to be commended for attempting to achieve financial stability, she has yet to\ndemonstrate she has attained the state of financial stability required before she could be granted a\nclearance. Whether she will reach that state remains to be seen.  Given her current unresolved\nsituation based on the fact her bankruptcy discharge has not been granted and she has not established\na budget, I have little upon which to conclude she has changed her behavior.\nI have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and viewing the facts in the light\nmost favorable to the Applicant am able to apply MC 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . unexpected medical\nemergency, or. . . separation.  \nWhile Applicant may be given consideration for uncovered medical expenses and insufficient\nchild support, she is unable to overcome the \u201cbad judgment\u201d aspect of her conduct.  Until such time\nas she is able to demonstrate a track record of financial responsibility over a reasonable period of\ntime, I am unable to find for Applicant on this concern.\nIn reaching my decision I have applied the facts and circumstances presented in this case\nusing the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept as required by the Directive.  I have specifically considered\nApplicant\u2019s 16 years of employment with the same company and the challenges she has encountered\nbeing a single mother.  Unfortunately, Applicant\u2019s has been unable to establish she has regained\ncontrol of her financial situation.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.r.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nRobert J.

Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 30, 2007\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,  and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The guidelines were\nprovided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on February 20,\n2007. On April 26, 2007, he elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on June 1, 2007.\nI convened a hearing on June 20, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Five government exhibits\n(Ex. 1-5) and six Applicant exhibits (A-F) were admitted, and testimony was taken from Applicant.\nThe hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on July 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged Applicant owed delinquent debt totaling $12,529  to 11 creditors (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.k)\nfollowing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in December 1996 (\u00b6 1.l) despite monthly discretionary\nincome of $977 (\u00b6 1.m), and that he had no intention of satisfying the debts (\u00b6 1.m). Applicant\nadmitted the unpaid debts as alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c,  1.g, and 1.h; corrected the unpaid balances\n1\nof \u00b6 1.d to $1,046 and of \u00b6 1.e to $1,164; and denied \u00b6 1.f, 1.i (duplication of 1.h), 1.j. (not his\naccount), and 1.k (paid). Applicant also admitted the 1996 bankruptcy, and that he had $977 in\ndiscretionary funds each month but had no intention of satisfying his bad debts. Applicant attributed\nhis financial problems to the deaths of his mother, aunt, and spouse within the span of nine months\nin 1999/00, and to a job layoff in July 2000 (\"I just didn't choose to stop paying bills it was forced\nupon me.\"). Applicant averred that he regrets not paying the bills, but understands that by the end\nof the year, they will become uncollectible under state law.\nApplicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough consideration\nof the pleadings, exhibits, and transcripts, I make the following additional findings:\nApplicant is a 57-year-old janitor who has worked off and on for the same defense contractor\nsince October 1983. He has been laid off five times since September 1996 for periods ranging from\nfour months to three years. Applicant held a confidential-level security clearance for much of his\nemploy and he seeks to regain a clearance necessary for access to areas of the facility.\n\nSOR \u00b6 1.l was amended at the hearing to note the correct date of the bankruptcy filing.\n2\nApplicant indicated on his security clearance application (e-QIP) that he was consistently employed from\n3\nAugust 1997 to October 1999. His earnings for 1999 were only $13,387 (Ex. A), which suggests he was laid off earlier\nin that year based on his income for the previous year.\n3\nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s joint income from employment amounted to $29,872.23 in 1994.\nIt rose  to $43,102.31 in 1995, largely due to a $11,152.86 increase in her earnings over the previous\nyear. In 1996, Applicant\u2019s spouse was laid off, and they began to experience financial difficulty. On\nSeptember 10, 1996, Applicant and his spouse filed a joint petition for bankruptcy seeking Chapter\n7 liquidation of $31,710.16 in liabilities, of which $1,283.83 was tax debt, $13,050.30 credit card\ndebt, $10,241.89 personal loan debt, and $4,300 in deferred student loan debt.  One of the loans was\n2\nfor a car that Applicant had bought for his older son. Another was for this son\u2019s college expenses.\nAbout $710.47 of the personal loan debt was for a vacation. Applicant and his spouse\u2019s net monthly\nincome from his wage earnings and her unemployment compensation amounted to $2,079.10, which\nwas short of their monthly expenses of $2,083.00. On December 17, 1996, they were granted a\nChapter 7 discharge of all dischargeable debts. The student loan debt was not discharged, but was\nlater paid by insurance when his spouse died in 2000.\nApplicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Investigative Service on\nNovember 5, 1997, about adverse credit information. Applicant indicated that all of his debts had\nbeen discharged in bankruptcy with the exception of a $74 medical debt that had been delinquent\nbut then paid in full. He averred he was current on all of his financial obligations since the\nbankruptcy, which he attributed to the loss of his spouse\u2019s income and his year-long layoff.\nApplicant was unemployed from September 1996 to September 1997, his spouse from about\nJanuary 1996 to early 1998. Applicant earned $21,236 in 1996 (down from $28,781 the previous\nyear), and only $12,721 in 1997. He collected unemployment at about $500 per week. Applicant\nworked the entire year in 1998, and earned $30,441. Applicant\u2019s spouse worked for only four months\npart-time, and then went to school to become a medical transcriber at a tuition cost of about $1,200,\nwhich they paid. Applicant was again laid off in 1999, and his total earnings were only $13,387.  His\n3\nspouse started working as a medical transcriber, and she earned about $19,065.92.\nAt the time of his layoff in about October 1999, Applicant was undergoing chemotherapy\ntreatment for bladder cancer. His initial surgery was covered by his medical insurance, and while he\nwas out of work, it cost him about $527 per month to continue his coverage. In September 1999, his\nmother died of cancer. In December 1999, Applicant came home one day to discover that his aunt\nhad died in her apartment upstairs from Applicant. Later in the month, his 19-year-old daughter quit\ncollege and moved back home. His youngest son was 13 at the time, and Applicant compensated for\nthe lost generosity of his aunt and mother by spending more on holiday gifts for his children.\nIn January 2000, Applicant\u2019s daughter began working at the same company as her mother.\nIn March 2000, Applicant was recalled to work, but his spouse died after emergency surgery the\nfollowing month. He incurred unexpected funeral expenses and lost her income. In June 2000, he\nwas again laid off for another six months. His daughter, upset at seeing someone else in what had\nbeen her mother\u2019s position at work, quit her job. Applicant earned $17,467 in 2000, and found it\n\n4\ndifficult to meet his financial obligations as he also paid for his daughter to attend schooling to\nbecome a certified nurse assistant.\nApplicant returned to work in 2001 and earned $31,720 that year. Yet, he was again laid off\nfrom his defense contractor job, in about late January 2002 so earned only $4,081 in 2002. Applicant\nworked for a discount warehouse retailer as a cashier in 2003, starting at $7.75 per hour. His total\nearnings for 2003 were only $9,656. Applicant supported his family, in part, on his younger son\u2019s\nsocial security survivor\u2019s benefit of $300 per month. Several accounts were charged off and/or\nplaced for collection:\n\u2022\nA MasterCard account opened in August 1997 was charged off in the amount\nof $1,457 in March 2002 after there had been no activity on the account since\nJuly 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.e).\n\u2022\nA VISA card account, opened in November 1999, with a credit limit of\n$1,500, was charged off in February 2002 in the amount of $1,645.26 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.h and \u00b6 1.i, same debt).\n\u2022\nA VISA card account opened in November 1999 with the same lender as the\nMasterCard account above was charged off in May 2002 in the amount of\n$1,079 due to nonpayment since sometime in 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant\nstopped paying anything on the account when the creditor was not willing to\nwaive the interest charges and other late fees.\n\u2022\nIn August 2000, Applicant took out an installment loan of $6,000 to be repaid\nat $149 per month for five years. The loan was to pay for the headstone on\nhis spouse\u2019s grave. He made no payments after October 2001, and a\n$5,205.72 debt balance was charged off in May 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.g)\n\u2022\nA $54 cellular telephone debt was placed for collection in or about December\n2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant disputes the legitimacy of the debt as he had\ncancelled his service before the charges were applied.\n\u2022\nAs of December 2001, Applicant had an automobile loan that was seriously\ndelinquent in the amount of $225. He had given the vehicle to his daughter\non her promise that she would pay the remaining balance of the loan. When\nhe learned that she had not paid it and the account had been charged off, he\nsatisfied the debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k).\nIn December 2004, Applicant was laid off from his job with the wholesale retailer. He\ncollected $62 per week in unemployment compensation until about February 2005, when he began\nworking for another retailer. In June 2005, he was recalled to his defense contractor employment.\nHe continued working for the retailer on the weekends until sometime in spring 2006, earning extra\nmoney to get caught up on his bills (utilities, car insurance). He made no effort to repay his old\ndelinquencies because \u201cthey were too far gone.\u201d (Tr. 124).\n\n5\nOn September 13, 2005, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP). Applicant responded affirmatively to 28 a. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and 28 b. \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on\nany debt(s)?\u201d and listed a balance due of $6,700 on a personal loan with a credit union since about\nJanuary 2001 (aggregate balance of SOR \u00b61.g and \u00b6 1.h).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on September 2005 revealed that Applicant also owed\ndelinquent credit card balances of $1,457 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and $1,079 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), a $54 telephone debt\nin collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and two unpaid medical debts of $54 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $80 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) in\ncollection. He owed an aggregate debt balance of $2,824 on four consumer credit accounts opened\nin or after March 2003 and rated \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s had a retail charge account in\ncollection status that appeared on Applicant\u2019s credit report because Applicant was an authorized user\nof the account (SOR \u00b6 1.j). As of May 2004, his son owed $937.29. Applicant never used the credit\ncard.\nIn about Fall 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense about his finances. He estimated for the agent that he had about $977 left\nover each month after paying his expenses (SOR \u00b6 1.m), but he failed to calculate the costs of his\ngrandson\u2019s nursery school and of other items for his grandchildren and children. He bought a grill\nfor his son as his son was having a party (\u201cYes, I do spend a hell of a lot on my kids, I do.\u201d Tr. 61).\nA subsequent check of Applicant\u2019s credit on December 15, 2006, showed Applicant was\ncontinuing to rely on consumer credit. He opened a credit card account in April 2006 with a $400\nlimit. The balance of that account was $395. Another account opened in November 2006 had a\nbalance of $50. The four charge accounts opened between March 2003 and March 2005 were still\nrated as current, although on one account the debt balance of $956 exceeded his credit limit of $845.\nIn addition to the total debt of $4,034 on those four accounts, Equifax reported he owed delinquent\ndebt of $3,098 ($54 on SOR \u00b6 1.a, $80 on SOR \u00b6 1.b, $54 on SOR \u00b6 1.c, $1,246 on SOR \u00b6 1.d, and\n$1,664 on SOR \u00b6 1.e). Discrepant credit information was reported as to the $6,000 charged off\npersonal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Equifax reported that Applicant owed a zero balance on the debt as of\nOctober 2001 but $6 after charge off as of November 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Trans Union had reported\nthe debt balance of \u00b6 1.g to be $5,210 as of September 2006. Documentation from the creditor (Ex.\nF) confirms a balance of $5,205.72 as of February 2007.\nApplicant has not made any payments on his delinquent debt because a family friend advised\nhim that the debts were not legally collectable under state law after six or seven years. Applicant\ndoes not intend to repay any of the debts.\nApplicant\u2019s net pay as of June 2007 was about $557 weekly. He drives a 1988 model-year\ncar that is paid for. His daughter lives with him, and she pays half the $1,000 monthly rent. Applicant\ncovers all the utility costs and the groceries. He has a checking account in which he maintains a $200\nbalance for emergencies. Applicant owes $2,200 in federal taxes for tax year 2006 that he has to\nrepay at $62 per month after an initial payment of $105. Applicant is paying about $105 total per\nmonth on his  four credit card accounts with an aggregate balance of about $2,500. He was current\nin his utility and credit card payments as of June 2007.  \n\n6\nAs of June 2007, the older of Applicant\u2019s two sons was married with two children. This son\nwas working part-time while studying at the university. Applicant\u2019s younger son was 20 and putting\nhimself through college, although Applicant helped him financially when he moved to an apartment\ncloser to school and work in March 2007. In 2006, Applicant gave his daughter $540 to get her car\nout of the impound lot after she had an accident. She has been employed for the past six months as\nan emergency medical technician.\nOut of his net pay of about $2,228 monthly, Applicant pays monthly living expenses of about\n$1,600, including about $6 per day spent at the cafeteria at work. He also pays $40 per month for his\nyounger son\u2019s car insurance, and gives him $150 per month for his college expenses. Applicant also\nspends about $75 to $100 a month on his two grandsons. After factoring in his credit card, and\nrequired income tax payments, it would appear that he has about $170 per month left over for\nincidentals, although he was unable to account for those funds. He also was unable to provide\nspecifics as to his recent purchases on credit that have led him to owe about $2,500 in active credit\ncard debt.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18).  Applicant has had financial problems starting\n\nThe debt in \u00b6 1.j is his oldest son\u2019s (see MC 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\n4\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue). There is inconclusive evidence as to whether\nApplicant owes the very minor $6 debt alleged in 1.f, and he disputes the legitimacy of the debt in \u00b6 1.c.\n7\nin the mid-1990s. In December 1996, he was granted a discharge in bankruptcy of credit card debt\ntotaling $13,050.30 and $10,241.89 in personal loan debt. The financial fresh start afforded\nApplicant through the bankruptcy was short-lived. In August 1997, he opened a MasterCard  card\naccount that was delinquent by July 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). A VISA card account opened with the same\nlender in November 1999 was charged off in April 2001 with a balance owed of $1,246 (SOR \u00b6 1.d).\nAnother VISA account opened with a different lender in that same month was charged off in July\n2001 with $1,645 past due (SOR \u00b6 1.h). He paid only about $790 of the $6,000 borrowed to pay for\nhis spouse\u2019s gravestone (SOR \u00b6 1.g). As of June 2007, these debts as well as some undisputed minor\nmedical debts in collection totaling $134 had not been satisfied. Guideline F disqualifying conditions\n\u00b6 19(a), inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and \u00b6 19(c), a history of not meeting financial\nobligations, apply.\nThe government\u2019s case for application of DC \u00b6 19(b), indebtedness caused by frivolous or\nirresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt, is less persuasive. Although his recent expenditure of a grill\nfor his son is difficult to justify when old debts remain unpaid, his financial difficulties were caused\nlargely by circumstances beyond his control (loss of his spouse\u2019s income and his repeated job\nlayoffs) rather than by irresponsible spending.  The personal loan debts discharged in bankruptcy,\nincluding a loan for a car for his son, were taken out in or before January 1996 when he and his\nspouse\u2019s joint income was about $43,000. They experienced a precipitous loss of income in 1996\nwhen his spouse lost her job, and the problems continued in 1997 because he was also laid off. He\nearned only $12,721 in 1997 and his spouse was unemployed. While he worked the entire year of\n1998 and was paid $30,441 by the defense contractor, Applicant\u2019s spouse worked for only four\nmonths part-time that year, and then went to school to become a medical transcriber at a tuition cost\nof about $1,200, which they paid. Applicant was again laid off in 1999, and his earned income for\nthat year was only $13,387. His spouse started working as a medical transcriber, and she earned\nabout $19,065.92, but $527 of their income each month had to go to medical insurance while\nApplicant was undergoing treatment for cancer. On his spouse\u2019s untimely death in April 2000,\nApplicant incurred unexpected burial costs that he could not pay (SOR \u00b6 1.g) without a loan due to\nhis unemployment from June 2000 to December 2000.  Full employment in 2001 gave him a chance\nto get caught up in his living expenses, but subsequent layoffs left him with earned income of only\n$4,081 in 2002 and $9,656 in 2003, which is not enough to pay his living expenses or his credit\nobligations, even with unemployment compensation. Mitigating condition \u00b6 20(b), the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, applies.\nAs of June 2007, Applicant had taken no steps to resolve the $9,894.72 in outstanding\ndelinquent debt that he does not dispute (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h).  Failure to satisfy\n4\ndebts may indicate a lack of judgment or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, but\nApplicant\u2019s overall attitude toward his finances has not been one of cavalier disregard. He was not\nin a position to repay his old obligations when he was advised by a family friend that he should not\n\n8\npay them because they would soon be legally unenforceable. After he was recalled to his defense\ncontractor job in June 2005, Applicant showed good financial judgment in continuing to work part-\ntime for his previous employer until spring 2006. The extra income was needed to catch up on those\nday-to-day obligations that had fallen behind when he was earning only $7.50 to $8.50 an hour.\nWhile he estimated discretionary income of about $977 per month as of May 2006, the reality was\nthat he failed to account for all of his expenses. Recent expenditures for his youngest son\u2019s college\neducation and to get his daughter\u2019s car out of the impound lot are understandable. A current estimate\nof $170 in monthly disposable income does not include seasonally higher costs for utilities, but\nApplicant does not appear to be at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds to repay\nhis debts. There is no evidence of active collection efforts by his old creditors, and his delinquencies\nare or will soon be legally uncollectible. Outstanding balances were close to the credit limits on four\nof his six charge accounts opened since March 2003 ($395 balance on $400 limit, $478 balance on\n$500 limit, $1,469 on $1500 limit, $1,131 on 1,150 limit), and he was over the limit on one account\n($956 on $845 limit).  Yet, he owed no past due balances on those accounts, and was current in his\nliving expenses.\nApplicant lives simply, sharing a home with his daughter and driving a 1988-model year\nvehicle. Whatever funds he has he spends on his children in the hope that they will have a better life\nthan he had. His expenditures for his children are not so extravagant as to jeopardize his financial\nsolvency which he has regained through his own hard work. Furthermore, Applicant has held a\nsecurity clearance without adverse incident when the financial stressors were greater than at present.\nThe decision as to a person\u2019s security suitability does not turn simply on whether a debt is paid or\nnot. While Applicant cannot avail himself of the benefit of mitigating condition \u00b6 20 (d), the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, the\nabsence of any recent delinquency weighs in his favor (see \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control). Given the considerable extenuating circumstances (layoffs, spouse\u2019s\ndeath, inadequate income while employed in retail) in this case, the Financial Considerations\nconcerns do not rise to the level to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s clearance.\nWhole-Person Concept\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. AG \u00b6 2(a). Each\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and\nadjudication policy. Directive \u00b6 6.3. Applicant has experienced more than his share of hardship not\nof his own doing. Despite several layoffs between September 1996 and June 2005, he has managed\nto provide for his now grown children while not falling seriously behind in his day-to-day\nobligations. The government must be assured that those individuals granted access can be counted\non to put their fiduciary obligations ahead of their personal interests. His employer has found him\nreliable enough to recall him to work several times, and Applicant has not violated his employer\u2019s\ntrust during the many years that he has held a clearance despite enduring the many unforeseen\nproblems already discussed.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

MASON\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJohn B. Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nWhile engaging in binge drinking for about eight years, Applicant encountered three alcohol-\nrelated incidents between February 1995 and November 2003. He was diagnosed alcohol dependent\nin December 2003. Though the current period of abstinence precludes Applicant from overcoming\nthe adverse guidelines under alcohol consumption, I find for Applicant under the whole person\nmodel based on the good faith efforts he has taken to foster a network that strengthens his life of\nsobriety. Because he does not want to lose his wife or career, Applicant has convinced me he will\nstay the course for long-lasting recovery. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn May 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\n\n Applicant\u2019s character exhibit (AE A, one page) was returned to him at the hearing so he could make copies\n1\nfor all parties. On September 13, 2007, Applicant\u2019s witness transmitted the two page exhibit (one page cover statement\nidentifying exhibit, and one page character statement) to Department Counsel by facsimile. The entire exhibit(three pages\nin length), including the cover letter from Department Counsel, is received in evidence. \n2\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as revised by Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) made effective on September 1, 2006, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant. The SOR indicated that based on excessive alcohol consumption (Guideline G), DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. On June 21, 2007, Applicant provided\nhis response to the SOR and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 6, 2007. On the same day, this case was set for\nhearing on September 12, 2007. The Government submitted five exhibits. In addition to his\ntestimony, one witness provided testimony on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant submitted one exhibit.1\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on September 26, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR has nine allegations under the alcohol consumption guideline. Applicant admitted\nall factual allegations. \nApplicant is 42 years old. He has been married for 23 years, and has two teenage children.\nFrom 1983 to March 2004, Applicant served in the United States Air Force (USAF) in aircraft\nmaintenance. Since April 2004, Applicant has been employed in a similar position with a defense\ncontractor as an aircraft helper. He seeks a secret level clearance. \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e. (February 1995 to November 2003) reveal incidents where\nApplicant used alcohol and then was involved in traffic infractions or disorderly conduct. During the\nperiod, Applicant\u2019s drinking was primarily on the weekend when \u201cI would normally stay up all \u2013\nmost of the day on a Friday until early hours of the morning drinking and then sleeping the rest of\nthe day. Then I would feel guilty because the whole weekend was gone.\u201d (Tr. 44) On February 20,\n1995, Applicant was 30 or 31 years of age, and in the USAF. While studying for an exam that would\nqualify him for promotion, he talked himself into drinking excessively, and recalled being involved\nin an altercation at the non-commissioned officer\u2019s club. He was charged with disorderly conduct\nand breach of the peace. (subparagraph 1.a.) Applicant believes he lost rank as a result of this\nincident rather than the incident outlined in subparagraph 1.c. \nSubparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c. reference the same alcohol-related incident. On May 10, 2000,\nApplicant was arrested and charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI,\nsubparagraph 1.b.). He pled no contest to the charge and was fined $816.00, sentenced to six months\nprobation, 50 hours of community service, and his license was suspended for 6 months. As a result\nof the May 10, 2000 DUI, Applicant received an Article 15, and was required to attend an alcohol\nand drug program for 6 months. (Subparagraph 1.c.) While Applicant did not believe he was\n\n Having recalled the examination of Applicant on this issue, I find Applicant was referring to the legal limit\n2\nof alcohol in his blood stream. \n Applicant realizes that the smart decision would be to obtain a medical diagnosis before taking any more\n3\nantabuse medication, though he thought the counselor who furnished the February 2007 evaluation, would provide him\nwith a prescription for the antabuse. (Tr. 37,40)\n3\nintoxicated enough to be arrested for DUI, he did think he was over the limit.2\nAfter consuming an unknown amount of alcohol on November 19, 2003 (subparagraph 1.e.),\nApplicant was backing his car out of a parking lot and recalled running over an object that he thought\nwas the curb. After pleading no contest leaving the scene of an accident involving property\n(subparagraph 1.d.), he was fined. \nFollowing his conviction for leaving the scene of an accident, Applicant advised his chain\nof command in November 2003 that he had a alcohol problem. After receiving a diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence, he enrolled in a 30-day inpatient treatment program (subparagraph 1.f.) that he\nsuccessfully completed. Following his treatment, he testified he participated in AA in 2004 and 2005\nabout three or four times a week. (Tr. 32-33) He testified he started relapsing after he stopped\nattending AA and his discharge (June 2004) from the military, with his first relapse occurring a few\nmonths after his discharge. (Tr. 34). Applicant has had about one relapse every six months with his\nlast relapse occurring in September 2006 (subparagraph 1.h.) in the company of his brother. (Tr. 35)\nIn September 2006, Applicant wanted stop drinking alcohol as his brother had done three\nyears ago. So he traveled to his brother\u2019s home to learn about how to reach lasting sobriety. Though\nhis brother was drinking alcohol along with Applicant during their meeting, the brother was trying\nto persuade Applicant to stop drinking. At his brother\u2019s recommendation, Applicant attended a\nchurch service. Applicant also received a large amount of antabuse from his brother that he has been\ntaking regularly. (Tr. 37)  He indicates he has missed only one church service since September 2006.\n3\nHis wife currently attends church with him. At his wife\u2019s urging and because of stress associated\nwith the security clearance investigation, Applicant resumed AA approximately three months ago.\n(Tr. 36) He intends to continue with his church participation, and to maintain lifetime involvement\nwith AA. Applicant does more work in the yard. In addition, he jogs and lifts weights on a regular\nbasis to become healthier. \nDOHA requested Applicant obtain a substance evaluation. On February 5, 2007, Applicant\nwas interviewed by a licensed mental health counselor and certified addictions professional.\n(subparagraph 1.i.) In obtaining his drinking history, she learned his last alcohol consumption was\nin September 2006, as he had informed DOHA. (GE 2) She stated that based on an interview in\nwhich she learned he was not in any sort of support group, \u201cthis concerns me as [a] person addicted\nto alcohol never recovers but is said to be in \u201crecovery.\u201d Most need some type of support group or\ncounseling to maintain abstinence.\u201d In view of Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, the counselor\nrecommended outpatient counseling to address abstinence issues such as relapse, triggers, and\nupdated research. (AE A) \nThe program manager for Applicant\u2019s employer testified he met Applicant in 2001 when\nApplicant was in the USAF working as an aircraft technician. The manager recalled Applicant has\n\n4\nbeen an employee of their employer since April 2004. In the period, the manager has found\nApplicant to be an outstanding aircraft helper, demonstrating professionalism in all elements of his\njob. In the summer of 2007, the manager and Applicant were socializing with a large group. The\nmanager recalled Applicant was drinking alcohol, but did not appear to have an alcohol-related\nproblem that evening. (Tr. 56)\nHaving carefully evaluated the evidence as a whole, including the demeanor and conduct of\nApplicant, I find Applicant\u2019s testimony to be credible. Though he understands the negative\nimplications of using antabuse without a prescription, he intends to resolve this problem swiftly by\nseeking the appropriate medical help so the drug will be available for him should a doctor determine\na continuing need.\nPOLICIES\nThe AG contains disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) that should\nbe given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations. These conditions must\nbe considered in every case along with the general factors of the whole person concept. However,\nthe conditions are not automatically determinative of the decision in any case nor can they supersede\nthe Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nAlcohol Consumption (AC)\nExcessive alcohol consumption inevitably leads to questionable judgment and may also raise\ndoubt about a person\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nCONCLUSIONS\nExcessive alcohol consumption generally leads to acts of poor judgment that establishes\ndoubt concerning an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. The acts of poor judgment may\noccur at work or away from work. The facts and circumstances of this case make the following\n\n5\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) applicable: AC DC 22.a. (alcohol-related incidents away from work);\nAC DC 22.c. (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent); AC\nDC 22.d. (evaluation by a duly qualified medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence); and AC DC 22.f. (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and\ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program) The nine factual allegations show three alcohol-\nrelated incidents (AC DC 22.a.) in which Applicant admitted he had consumed too much. In\nFebruary 1995, he talked himself into drinking and not only lost a promotion-in-rank he was studying\nto qualify for, but also his current rank. In May 2000, Applicant received both civil and military\npunishment for drinking too much alcohol. In November 2003, after consuming an unknown amount\nof alcohol, Applicant displayed poor judgment by causing damage to property and leaving the scene\nof the accident. During the time span the incidents occurred, Applicant was engaged in binge\ndrinking (AC DC 22.c.) where he would start drinking on Friday until early Saturday morning, and\nbasically sleep for the rest of the weekend. \nShortly after the November 2003 offense, Applicant approached his chain of command and\nagreed to 30 days of inpatient treatment. Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol dependence (AC DC 21.d.)\nwas followed by successful completion of the treatment program in December 2003. After his\ndischarge from treatment, Applicant recalled no relapses during his participation in AA until around\nSeptember 2004. Then, he began to have one relapse (AC DC 21.f.) about every six months with the\nlast one occurring with his brother in September 2006. \nHaving weighed and balanced the entire record regarding Applicant\u2019s binge consumption of\nalcohol, there are two mitigating conditions that are potentially applicable under the AC guideline.\nThe first is AC MC 23.a. (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) The second condition is AC MC\n23.b. (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser) Given Applicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol\nuse between 1995 and 2003, the passage of only one year of sobriety since September 2006 does not\nqualify under the time element of AC MC 23.a., even though Applicant\u2019s relapses have been\ninfrequent since his treatment in December 2003. Furthermore, the infrequent relapses also raise\nlingering doubts into the depth of Applicant\u2019s determination to remain sober in the future. The\nlimited mitigation that accrues to Applicant\u2019s benefit under AC MC 23.a. is based on the good\njudgment he exercised in September 2006 in seeking help with his alcohol problem while finding\nout how his brother had accomplished three years of sobriety. \nAC MC 23.b. applies in part as Applicant acknowledges his alcohol dependence, and he has\nprovided meaningful evidence that shows he is trying to overcome the problem. The church\ninvolvement and AA participation are working for Applicant to strengthen his recovery. While\nApplicant\u2019s misuse of a prescription drug demonstrates poor judgment because he did not receive\nthe drug by prescription, Applicant has credibly testified he intends to seek medical advice so that\nhe can use the drug legally. Even with the antabuse, church involvement, and AA however, the\npattern of abstinence is not long enough under AC MC 23.b.\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\n\n6\ncircumstances of this case under the whole person concept of the Directive. Applicant\u2019s excessive\nconsumption of alcohol raises serious trustworthiness concerns. Between 1995 and November 2003,\nApplicant was between 30 and 38 years of age, and sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for\nhis conduct. Though there were short periods of abstinence, there is little or no evidence Applicant\ntook any substantive action to remedy his drinking problem until November 2003. However, he\nexercised good judgment by voluntarily seeking and completing inpatient treatment in December\n2003. His good judgment continued after treatment with his participation in AA for about nine\nmonths in 2004 before encountering his first relapse. Though the relapses have been infrequent, they\nstill cause security concerns. However, the concerns are sufficiently neutralized by Applicant taking\nthe appropriate steps to help himself beginning in the meeting with his brother in September 2006.\nThe meeting with his brother caused Applicant to stop drinking and discover how religion an\nantabuse could work in his recovery as it had worked in his brother\u2019s recovery. Since September\n2006, Applicant has watched his relationship with his wife become healthier as their arguments have\ndramatically decreased. She persuaded him to resume his participation in AA. She regularly\naccompanies him to church which he has missed only once since September 2006. He does not want\nto lose her after 23 years of marriage or his 21-year career in airplane maintenance, and finally\nrealizes he has to stay with AA to strengthen his recovery. Applicant also regularly jogs and lifts\nweights to improve his health. The time he used to spend drinking is utilized productively in\nsprucing up the yard around his house. In viewing the totality of the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s\nrehabilitative efforts, though less clear in September 2006, are firmly in place at the present time.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s church involvement and AA participation, the behavioral changes and regular\ncontact with his brother, it is my predictive decision under the whole person concept that Applicant\u2019s\ncredible efforts to maintain his sobriety will keep his excessive alcohol consumption safely in the\npast. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 are:\nParagraph 1 (Alcohol Consumption, Guideline G): FOR THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph a.\nFor the Applicant. \nSubparagraph b.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph c.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph d.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph e.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph f.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph g.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph h.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph i.\nFor the Applicant.\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted. \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",
