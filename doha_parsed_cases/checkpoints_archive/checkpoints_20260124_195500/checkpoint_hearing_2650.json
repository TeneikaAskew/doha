DOHA received the hearing transcript on April 25, 2022. \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts about \nAfghanistan. (HE 1) The facts administratively noticed are summarized in the Findings of \nFact, which I supplemented with more timely information from online U.S. Government and \npublic resources addressing generally accepted facts about the historic and current status \nof Afghanistan. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor, applying for \na position as an interpreter/translator. He was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and graduated \nfrom high school in 2008 in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He completed some college \ncoursework. He married in Kabul, Afghanistan, in June 2013, and has two children; ages \nfour and seven. He has been employed as a semi-truck driver since February 2021. \nAfter the Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan and civil war, Applicant was smuggled \nout of Afghanistan via Pakistan in about 1999, to work with his uncle in a tailor shop in Iran. \nHe lived in Iran for about one year when he fell ill and returned to Afghanistan in 2000 to live \nwith his parents, and then as a refugee in the United Nations Refugee Resettlement \nprogram. From 2008 to 2011, Applicant worked at a joint U.S./UK base in Lashkar Gah, the \ncapital of Helmand Province, Afghanistan. First he worked for the British Foreign \nCommonwealth Office as a management assistant where he supervised maintenance \nworkers, then in 2011, he worked for the U.S. Marine Corps and another government agency \n(OGA) as a political advisor and translator/interpreter. He often accompanied U.S. personnel \nin dangerous meetings with tribal leaders. He lived in town with his family until he was \nrecognized and threatened by a village elder and Taliban supporter. Because of the threat \nto his life, he was moved to on-base housing for his safety. The joint base closed in 2013, \nand the Marines and OGA personnel at the base strongly supported his immigration to the \nU.S. \nIn December 2013, Applicant and his spouse relocated to the United States under a \nSpecial Immigrant Visa (SIV) program for persons employed in Afghanistan by U.S. \ngovernment or by the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF). An SIV under this \nprogram is available to those who have provided documented faithful and valuable service \nto the U.S. government or ISAF, and have experienced or are experiencing an ongoing \nserious threat as a consequence of their employment. (https://travel.state.gov/content/ \ntravel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-immg-visa-afghans-employed-us-gov.html) Applicant \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2019, and his spouse became a citizen in May \nor June, 2019.

It alleges his mother, father, six sisters, two brothers, and mother and father-\nin-law are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.f) It also alleges his father,\nbrother, four uncles, and father-in-law have significant military and intelligence ties to the\nformer Afghan military and government. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g to 1.l) Finally, it alleges that Applicant\nowns property in Afghanistan, and provided financial support demanded by his father, and\nto his brother, father-in-law, and brother-in-law, all citizens of Afghanistan. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m to\n1.q) Applicant admitted all of the allegations except for owning property and providing\nfinancial support to his father under demand, however he does not deny financially\nsupporting his father. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, three sisters, and his youngest brother are citizens of and \nlive in Kabul, Afghanistan. His father, a former colonel and intelligence officer in the Afghan \nArmy, is retired and sick at home with deep shrapnel wounds. He learned of Applicant\u2019s \nwork with the Marines because they lived together. Applicant testified that his father worked \nfor the Taliban at one time, but he refused to fight the Northern Alliance and \u201csnuck out of \nKabul.\u201d \nThree weeks before the hearing, the Taliban searched his family\u2019s home for uniforms \nor other signs of military involvement. This was part of a Taliban sweep of homes in Kabul \nafter the U.S. withdrawal. His father told them he retired from the government three years \nago, and was not well. Applicant kept daily telephonic contact with his family during the most \nturbulent times, and now talks with them about weekly or bi-weekly. His spouse spoke to \nher family in Afghanistan weekly, and she traveled to Afghanistan with her children from \nMarch to September 2019, to visit family. About two weeks before the hearing, his in-laws \nwere forced to move to Pakistan for survival from the Taliban. His father-in-law previously \nworked for the Afghan army. \nSince no one in his parents\u2019 household is able to work since the fall of the Afghan \ngovernment, Applicant has provided financial support to his family since 2013 out of loyalty \nand familial obligation. In the last five years, he sent about $4,000 to $5,000 per year to his \nimmediate family. Since 2021, he sent about $10,000. Currently, he sends monthly support \nto his father of about $300 to $1,000, and at one time sent $4,000 to help them move to \nKabul. He sent about $8,000 to his father-in-law over the past eight years. He testified that \nif his family is caught receiving money from an American citizen, \u201cthere will be \nconsequences.\u201d \nApplicant has a brother that was a former Afghan intelligence officer who worked with \nU.S. forces and was evacuated to Abu Dhabi, UAE, when the Taliban took control. His \nbrother does not work or leave his hotel. He speaks to his brother in Abu Dhabi regularly. \nHe has two uncles who served as officers in the Afghan military (one in intelligence), but \nthey retired and may still live in Afghanistan. Applicant does not have regular contact with \nthem. He has another uncle who was a colonel in Afghan intelligence. His current work \nstatus is unclear. Applicant\u2019s spouse visited with him when she went to Afghanistan. Another \nuncle was a former brigadier general in the Afghan army special forces, who is in hiding \nfrom the Taliban.

He speaks to his oldest sister about once a \nmonth, but has limited contact with his other sisters. One sister, not alleged in the SOR, lived \nin Iran when Applicant lived there, but now works as a nurse in Afghanistan and has worked \nfor a U.S. relief organization. \nApplicant has no assets overseas, and rents an apartment in the U.S. In 2009, he \nand his friends purchased property in Afghanistan to build on. He paid about $5,000. He \ntransferred the property to his father before leaving Afghanistan, and no longer holds an \ninterest in it. Applicant earns about $72,000 - $90,000 per year as a truck driver, and has \nput a deposit down to purchase his own a semi-truck. Applicant stated that he owes his life \nto the U.S. Marines that he worked with and loves them more than his brothers. He stated \nthat the Marines treated him with respect and trusted him. His testimony at the hearing was \nsincere and credible. \nApplicant provided several strong letters of recommendation for his SIV and \nimmigration to the U.S. from American military and civilian government officials he worked \nwith in Afghanistan. He also received a Certificate of Commendation from the U.S. Marine \nCorps. \n \nAfghanistan \nAfghanistan is a country in Southwestern Asia that is approximately the size of Texas \n(249,935 square miles). Pakistan borders it on the east and the south. Iran borders it on the \nwest and Russia to the north. It is a rugged and mountainous country which has been fought \nover by powerful nations for centuries. \nAfghanistan has an unstable government led by the Taliban; a brutal, oppressive, \nmilitia group with longstanding animosity to the United States; and is a haven for other \nterrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, AQIS, and ISIS-K. The Taliban took control of the Afghan \ncapital after the U.S. and NATO forces precipitously withdrew from the country, ending on \nAugust 30, 2021. Following the effective collapse of the government of the Islamic Republic \nof Afghanistan during the 2021 Taliban offensive, the Taliban declared the country an \nIslamic Emirate. A new caretaker government was announced on September 7, 2021. The \nTaliban and terrorist organizations within Afghanistan have a history of extreme violence, \nhuman rights abuses, oppression against minorities and women, lawlessness, and \ncorruption. With a strong anti-western bias, all western individuals and Afghans associated \nwith the U.S. or NATO governments are at critical risk of becoming targets for terror groups \nand/or the Taliban. Afghanistan is considered an exceptionally dangerous country. \nAfghanistan has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the Soviet \nUnion in 1979. After an accord was reached in 1989, and the Soviet Union withdrew from \nAfghanistan, fighting continued among the various ethnic, clan, and religious militias. By the \nend of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of the country, imposing \naggressive and repressive policies. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the \ncountry, forcing the Taliban out of power by November 2001. The new democratic \ngovernment took power in 2004 after a popular election. \nOn 14 April 2021, the NATO Secretary General and President Biden agreed to \nwithdraw military troops from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021. Soon after the withdrawal \nstarted in May 2021, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, \nquickly advancing in front of collapsing Afghan government forces. On August 15, 2021, as \nthe Taliban once again controlled a vast majority of Afghan territory, they re-captured the \ncapital city of Kabul, and many civilians, government officials and foreign diplomats were \nevacuated. Afghan President Ghani fled Afghanistan that day. \nWestern nations have suspended most humanitarian aid to Afghanistan following the \nTaliban's takeover of the country in August 2021 and the World Bank and International \nMonetary Fund also halted payments. In October 2021, more than half of Afghanistan's 39 \nmillion people faced an acute food shortage. On November 11, 2021, Human Rights Watch \nreported that Afghanistan was facing widespread famine due to an economic and banking \ncrisis. \nA U.S. State Department Level \u201c4\u201d Travel Advisory remains in effect. The State \nDepartment warns U.S. citizens against travel to Afghanistan because of continued \ninstability and threats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. \nLaw and Policies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \u201ccontrol \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access \nto classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, \ncharacter, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance. \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from being \neligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or rational \nconnection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an \napplicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- 31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

They may also be a national security concern if they create \ncircumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help \na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way inconsistent \nwith U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and interests should \nconsider the country in which the foreign contact or interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is known to \ntarget U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 has three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in \na foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create \na potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect \nclassified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information or \ntechnology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen who maintains regular contact with his parents and at least \none sibling who are residents and citizens of Afghanistan, and his brother, a former Afghan \nintelligence officer, who escaped Afghanistan and currently resides as a refugee in the UAE. \nHe sends money to his family who is in dire need of assistance after the collapse of the \nAfghan government.

See Generally ISCR Case No. 03- 02382 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). There is a \nrebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, their \nimmediate family members. See generally ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS \n94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Afghanistan has an unstable government led by the \nTaliban, a brutal, oppressive, militia group with longstanding animosity to the United States, \nand is a haven for other terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, AQIS, and ISIS-K. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his relatives who are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan create a potential conflict of interest because of the potential for pressure to \nbe placed on his family living in Afghanistan in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise \nclassified information. These relationships and Afghanistan\u2019s political status create \u201ca \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. \nApplicant received an SIV to travel to the United States based on his work in a hostile \nenvironment for the U.S. Marine Corps and OGA while in Afghanistan. There have been \nthreats made against him and his family while he assisted U.S. interests. Finally, his spouse \nis a former citizen of Afghanistan and maintains regular contact with her family who fled \nAfghanistan for Pakistan.

Applicant has close and continuing contact with his parents and a sibling, who \nare citizens and residents of Afghanistan, and his brother, a former intelligence officer who \nfled Afghanistan for the UAE. He provides financial support for his family, and he is related \nto former senior Afghan military and intelligence officers. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) \nanalysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates.\u201d \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States.\u201d Applicant was born in Afghanistan, and \nserved honorably and admirably in supported of the U.S. and NATO missions in \nAfghanistan, sometimes putting his life in jeopardy to assist the U.S. Marine Corps. His \nloyal service to the U.S. enabled him to receive an SIV and immigrate with his spouse to \nthe United States where he has become a productive, faithful, patriotic American citizen. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens and \nresidents of Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s parents, siblings, and other family members currently \nlive in Afghanistan, generally in fear of the brutality of the Taliban regime. They are at a \nheightened risk from terrorists and the Taliban because of their association with the former \ngovernment and military. Applicant has been specifically targeted and threatened because \nof his service in support for U.S. and coalition forces. His relatives remaining in Afghanistan \nare potential targets of terrorists and the Taliban, and Applicant\u2019s potential access to \nclassified information or work with the U.S. Government could theoretically add risk to his \nrelatives living in Afghanistan, which could be leveraged against him. \nApplicant\u2019s patriotism is not being questioned, rather he has not shown that his ties \nto the U.S. outweigh his familial interests in Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s work with U.S. and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncoalition forces in Afghanistan and his glowing letters of recommendation for an SIV weigh \nin his favor. However, these factors are insufficient to overcome the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns raised above. Those concerns have not been sufficiently mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nA Guideline \u201cB\u201d decision concerning Afghanistan must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and risks posed for those living there. Afghanistan is an unstable and \ndangerous place because of violence and instability from the Taliban and terrorist \norganizations. Taliban and militias continue to threaten Afghan citizens with ties to the \nformer government, the interests of the United States, U.S. armed forces, and those who \ncooperate and assist the United States. Applicant\u2019s immediate family in Afghanistan and in-\nlaws, now in Pakistan, are subject to governmental and terrorist activity that puts Applicant \nat significant risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant is a credible and sincere American citizen who happens to have close ties \nto and/or supports family members in Afghanistan. His family\u2019s former professional positions \nin Afghanistan, and Applicant\u2019s support for and citizenship in the U.S., may place them in \ndanger. Applicant\u2019s interests in the United States do not overcome the foreign influence \nconcerns. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the foreign influence security concerns raised in the \nSOR and described above. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l, and 1.n-1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 1 at 6, 9-10; Tr. 2 at 5-6, 16, 54; GE 1; AE E) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 15 delinquent debts, comprised of 5 \ndelinquent consumer accounts totaling approximately $149,390 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.i, 1.k, \n1.o), and 10 delinquent mortgages culminating in property foreclosures in approximately \n2014, 2015, and 2016 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e, 1.g-1.h, 1.j, 1.l-1.n). The SOR allegations are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, in his 2017 security clearance \napplication (SCA), during his two interviews with a background investigator in 2018, in his \n2020 response to interrogatories, and by credit bureau reports from 2017, 2019, and \n2020. Applicant testified that he admitted the SOR allegations because he thought he \nwould get his security clearance renewed. He testified that he did not believe the SOR \nwas correct, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t see account numbers. I don\u2019t see property addresses.\u201d He \nalso testified that he could not recall his 2018 interviews with a background investigator, \nand that any admissions he made during the interviews or in his 2020 response to \ninterrogatories he did because he thought he would get his clearance renewed. (Answer; \nGE 1-5; Tr. 2 at 18-19, 47-48, 65-68, 75-76) \nAll of the SOR debts revolve around properties purchased by Applicant. In 2004, \nhe purchased for cash Condo 1, as stated above, in which he resided until 2014. He later \nobtained a first mortgage and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) through Bank 1 on \nCondo 1, as further discussed below. In 2008, he purchased five investment properties \nconsisting of the following: (1) two condominiums in state A (Condo 2 and Condo 3); (2) \na townhome in state A (TH); and (3) two homes in state B (Home 1 and Home 2). His tax \naccountant since 1988 advised him against buying the investment properties, but he \nbelieved that state A would not be affected by the economic downturn that had already \nbegun in late 2007, and he thought he would be able to handle the two smaller homes in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstate B. In purchasing his five investment properties, he opened five additional first \nmortgages and a second HELOC; he already had a first mortgage and a HELOC with \nBank 1 for Condo 1, as above discussed. He had \u201c. . . a total of eight loans around 2008,\u201d \nconsisting of six mortgages and two HELOCs. His loans totaled approximately $500,000. \nHe could not recall the details surrounding these loans, but recalled that he put 20% down \non each of the properties by using a portion of the $500,000 he inherited after his parents\u2019 \ndeath. (Tr. 2 at 35-43, 47-5, 51, 54-69, 75-85; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant testified that from approximately 2008 to 2014, he was somewhat able \nto use the rental income from his investment properties to pay the associated expenses. \nHe stated that he did not fully understand the extent of investment real estate expenses \nand acknowledged, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d He stated that his investment \nproperties were rented at times and unrented at other times, and he was unsuccessful in \ngetting his tenants to consistently pay their rent. He testified that his tenants refused to \npay their rent when the economy crashed in 2008, so he used his money to pay the \nmortgages on his investment properties; he hired attorneys to evict his tenants; he used \nhis money to make necessary repairs to the properties; and he obtained new tenants. He \ncould not recall the specific details surrounding each property. (Tr. 2 at 35-43, 47-5, 51, \n54-69, 75-85; GE 1, 2) \nBy 2009, Applicant realized he had made a mistake. He again consulted with his \ntax accountant, who advised him to get rid of his investment properties. He chose not to \ndo so because he continued to believe he could maintain them. He consulted with his tax \naccountant every year subsequent, and he repeatedly received the same advice. By \n2014, Applicant exhausted all of his inheritance. He did not have any money set aside, \nother than his retirement accounts, and he decided not to use his retirement money to \npay his mortgages. He last consulted with his tax accountant in 2014, and he was advised \nto contact the banks and work something out. He testified that he was \u201cemotionally \ndevastated that I was so wrong on the real estate market, but I bought the wrong \nproperties at the wrong time and I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly.\u201d (Tr. 2 at 35-43, 47-5, 51, 54-\n69, 75-85; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant chose to walk away from his real estate investments. He stopped paying \nhis mortgages on all of his properties in 2014 and his properties were foreclosed. He did \nnot contact his creditors to seek a loan modification on any of his mortgages; he did not \nattempt to sell his properties; and he did not seek any legal advice. He testified that when \nhe walked away from his properties, he was \u201cunder the assumption that I would have \nseven years of bad credit and that my credit would get better after the loans would be \ncharged off.\u201d He acknowledged that the first time he attempted to contact any of the \ncreditors for his SOR debts was in June 2021. He testified that \u201cif it\u2019s not on my credit \n[report], I think I\u2019m okay. That\u2019s my belief. That was my understanding in 2014.\u201d (Tr. 2 at \n35-43, 47-5, 51, 54-69, 75-85; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant also testified that in addition to trying to maintain the mortgage payments \non all of his properties, he also paid for both of his children\u2019s college tuition through his \nretirement annuity from approximately 2012 through 2018.

The 2017 credit bureau report reflects that: \n(1) Applicant obtained a mortgage with Bank 1 of approximately $150,000 in 2006; (2) \nApplicant\u2019s Bank 1 mortgage was reported as delinquent in 2014 and transferred to \nanother lender; (3) Applicant obtained a mortgage with Mortgage Servicer 1 of \napproximately $150,000 in 2006; and (4) Mortgage Servicer 1 foreclosed on Condo 1 in \n2017. The 2020 credit bureau report reflects a zero balance for Applicant\u2019s Bank 1 \nmortgage, but notes that its status is delinquent and the account has been transferred or \nsold. That credit bureau report does not report Applicant\u2019s Mortgage Servicer 1 mortgage. \nNeither the Bank 1 nor the Mortgage Servicer 1 mortgages are reported on the 2021 \ncredit bureau report. (Tr. 2 at 19-20, 37, 34-47, 65-68; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE G) \nThe 2017 credit bureau report also reflects that: (1) Applicant obtained a HELOC \nwith Bank 1 of approximately $57,652 in 2007; (2) Applicant\u2019s HELOC was reported as \ndelinquent in 2014; and (3) Applicant\u2019s HELOC was placed for collection by Mortgage \nServicer 2 in the approximate amount of $57,854. The 2019 credit bureau report reflects \nthat Applicant\u2019s Bank 1 HELOC was $18,046 past due with a total outstanding balance of \n$61,581. Applicant\u2019s Bank 1 HELOC is not reported on the 2020 or 2021 credit bureau \nreports. (Tr. 2 at 19-20, 37, 34-47, 65-68; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE G) \nApplicant testified: \nI believe [SOR \u00b6 1.a] was a mortgage but that mortgage was for $150,000 \nand there\u2019s no way I paid it down to [$61,000]. So, I think [SOR \u00b6 1.a] is \nwrong. I think [SOR \u00b6 1.a] should be the mortgage [on his residence in state \nA] but that\u2019s clearly not . . . That could be the HELOC but I don\u2019t know. \nHe also testified that he was unaware which property was associated with his Mortgage \nServicer 1 mortgage. However, he disclosed in his SCA that his Mortgage Servicer 1 \nmortgage was associated with Condo 1. He also discussed during his second interview \nwith a background investigator in 2018 (Interview 2), his Bank 1 and Mortgage Servicer \n1 mortgages on Condo 1, as well as his Bank 1 HELOC on Condo 1, placed for collection \nby Mortgage Servicer 2. (Tr. 2 at 19-20, 37, 34-47, 65-68; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE G) \nApplicant testified that he telephonically contacted Bank 1 in approximately June \n2021. He testified that Bank 1 told him that it had a record of him having a previous loan \nwith them, but there was no indication of a delinquency due to the age of the loan. He \nalso testified that he unsuccessfully attempted to contact Mortgage Servicer 1, and \nunsuccessfully attempted to contact Mortgage Servicer 2 in June 2021. He testified that \nhe did not know any further details about these debts; he could not recall whether he \nreceived an IRS Form 1099 (1099) for his Bank 1 or Mortgage Servicer 1 mortgages; if \nhe did, he would have given any 1099s to his tax preparer; and, he did not believe any of \nthese debts were reported on his 2021 credit bureau report.

(Tr. 2 at 16, 22-23, 31-32, 48, 50, 52, 54, 69-74, 80, 85-86; GE 1, 2; AE \nB, C, D, G, M) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and, \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe economic downturn from 2007 to 2009 were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol that partially contributed to his financial problems. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) \nonly partially applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. He provided documentation reflecting that \nhe does not have a deficiency balance for his mortgages in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g. The \nrecord evidence also demonstrates the following: (1) Applicant\u2019s HELOC for Condo 1 was \nno longer held by Bank 1 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), having been placed for collection by MS 2; (2) \nApplicant\u2019s Bank 2 mortgage for Home 1 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was transferred to Bank 3, who \nforeclosed on Home 1; and (3) Applicant\u2019s mortgage for Home 2, with Bank 2 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nand then MS 4 (SOR \u00b6 1.n), was transferred to MS 5, who foreclosed on Home 2. I find \nthat \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.n. \nApplicant sought his tax preparer\u2019s advice regarding all of his properties on \nmultiple occasions, but he repeatedly chose to ignore it. He chose to stop paying all of \nhis mortgages and allowed his properties to be foreclosed. He did not contact his \ncreditors to attempt to seek loan modifications, he did not attempt to sell his properties, \nhe did not seek any legal advice, and he has done nothing to try to resolve any of the \nrelated outstanding balances. After he received the SOR, he received credit counseling \nand he contacted some of his creditors for the first time, in June 2021. By his own \nadmission, he has simply waited for these delinquencies to fall off his credit report. I find \nthat such behavior did not happen so long ago, was not infrequent, and did not occur \nunder such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. It continues to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), \n20(d), and 20(e) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the additional findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old and an employee who is seeking a cleared position with a defense contractor, whom he formerly worked for in an unclassified position. He worked for his last employer starting in March 2019 and continued until he recently resigned to apply for a cleared position within the company. He is a field service technician. He served in the U.S. Army for eight years until he was honorably discharged in 1996 holding the rank of staff sergeant (E-6). Since his military discharge, he has mostly been employed by defense contractors in some capacity. He has been married 29 years. He has one child. His wife is a nurse. He is involved with youth activities within his community. This is his first request seeking a security clearance. He did not hold a clearance while in the Army. (Tr. 5-6, 18, 20-21, 23; GE 1) The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his 2010-2018 federal income tax returns as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The amendment to the SOR at his hearing added the allegation that he failed to timely file his 2019-2021 federal income tax returns as required (SOR \u00b6 1.b).

The case was assigned to me on May 17, 2022. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 10, \n2022, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on July 19, 2022.

Applicant testified, but did not offer any \nexhibits at his hearing. The record was kept open until August 19, 2022, to allow him to \nsubmit additional evidence. He timely submitted exhibits (AE) A-B, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 29, 2022. \nProcedural Issue \nBased upon Applicant\u2019s testimony where he admitted failing to file his federal tax \nreturns for tax years 2019-2021, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add \na second paragraph (SOR \u00b6 1.b) alleging that Applicant failed to timely file his federal \ntax returns for tax years 2019-2021. I discussed with Applicant his right to continue the \nhearing so that he could have time to prepare for the new allegations pursuant to the \nDirective. I also told him he could proceed with the hearing and he could submit \nadditional documentary evidence showing the status of his tax filings for years 2019-\n2021. He chose to proceed with the hearing and submit documentation post-hearing. I \ngranted the motion. (Tr. 48-50) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings \nof fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the additional findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 53 years old and an employee who is seeking a cleared position with \na defense contractor, whom he formerly worked for in an unclassified position. He \nworked for his last employer starting in March 2019 and continued until he recently \nresigned to apply for a cleared position within the company. He is a field service \ntechnician. He served in the U.S. Army for eight years until he was honorably \ndischarged in 1996 holding the rank of staff sergeant (E-6). Since his military discharge, \nhe has mostly been employed by defense contractors in some capacity. He has been \nmarried 29 years. He has one child. His wife is a nurse. He is involved with youth \nactivities within his community. This is his first request seeking a security clearance. He \ndid not hold a clearance while in the Army. (Tr. 5-6, 18, 20-21, 23; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his 2010-2018 federal income \ntax returns as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The amendment to the SOR at his hearing added \nthe allegation that he failed to timely file his 2019-2021 federal income tax returns as \nrequired (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nApplicant admitted the original allegation in his SOR answer and admitted the \namended allegation in his hearing testimony. He was straight forward with his \nexplanation as to why he failed to file federal tax returns for 11 years. He stated that he \nrelied on erroneous advice from coworkers who professed that he did not need to file \nany federal tax returns as long as he was having enough pay withheld via an IRS W-2 \nwage withholding procedure. If he did this, then the IRS would file his returns for him \nand if he owed more money, it would send him a bill for what he owed.

Additionally, his wife filed \nher separate federal tax returns under the \u201cmarried filing separate\u201d classification during \nthose years. (Tr. 22, 31, 33, 41; SOR Answer) \nApplicant stated that he realized that he was wrong about his tax filing obligations \nwhen he received the SOR in November 2020, however that did not prompt him to \ntimely file his 2020 or 2021 federal returns. He claimed that the full implication of his \nnon-filing hit him in September 2021 after people from his company explained the \nconsequences of his actions and how they impacted his chances of receiving a \nclearance. Before this time, he admitted that filing his tax returns was not a priority for \nhim. (Tr. 30, 46) \nApplicant presented documentation supporting his testimony that he hired an \naccountant to file his missing federal tax returns in June or July 2022. This \ndocumentation supports Applicant\u2019s claim that on approximately July 19, 2022, his \naccountant filed, on his behalf, federal income tax returns for tax years 2012-2021. \nThere is no documentation to support that his 2010-2011 federal returns were filed or an \nexplanation for why they were not filed. (Tr. 22; AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary in his last position was approximately $118,000. He \ntestified that his credit is good and that he uses a written monthly budget to track his \nfinances. He provided a copy of his budget. (Tr. 34, 47; AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.   \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record evidence supports that Applicant failed to timely file his 2010-2021 \nfederal income tax returns as he was required to do. I find the above disqualifying \ncondition is raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially applies: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant relied on \u201cbarracks accountancy,\u201d which gave him erroneous advice as \nto what his federal income tax filing obligations were resulting in him not complying with \nhis legal obligation for 11 years. While, I accept that he truly believed he did not have to \nfile based upon the erroneous lay-persons\u2019 tax advice, there is also an aspect of him \nsticking his head in the sand because he had always filed his federal tax returns before \n2010 and his wife, who filed separately, was filing her returns. He has attempted to \nrectify his mistake by hiring an accountant and having his 2012-2021 returns prepared \nand filed in July 2022. He failed to provide documentation regarding the filing of his \n2010-2011 returns. His non-filing and delay in filing show a lack of reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. While AG \u00b6 20(g) has some application, it does not \novercome his dilatory actions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s work history, his military service, his federal contractor \nemployment, and his community service. However, his non-filing and subsequent late \nfiling of his federal tax returns over a multi-year period cause me to question his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.b (amended allegation) Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

On May 23, 2022, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for June 8, 2022. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. I considered ten government exhibits marked \nand incorporated into the record as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, and the \ntestimony of Applicant. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open to allow \nApplicant to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted one exhibit \nthat I marked and incorporated into record as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on June 21, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 44-year old man with two adult children. He has been married since \n1999. He is a veteran of both the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force, serving initially in the \nArmy from 1997 to 2003, and then in the Air Force from 2003 to 2020. (Tr. 14; GE 2 at 5) \nHe retired honorably at the rank of senior master sergeant. (Tr. 23, 25) He has held a \nsecurity clearance since 1997. (Tr. 21) \nApplicant has a high school diploma and has earned approximately three years of \ncollege credits. He is currently working on a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology. \n(Tr. 14) He has been working for his current employer, an information technology company, \nsince January 2021. (Tr. 14) \nIn June 2013, Applicant was involved in a car accident. When the police opened the \nglove compartment to retrieve his registration, they discovered a handgun. (GE 2 at 6) \nSubsequently, Applicant was arrested and charged with transporting a handgun on a \nroadway. After a court placed him on probation before judgment for 18 months, the charge \nwas dismissed. (Tr. 15) \nApplicant was in the military when he was charged with the handgun violation. The \ngun was legally registered, and he had just been transferred from a state where it was legal \nto have a handgun in one\u2019s automobile. He was unfamiliar with the gun laws of his new \nstate of residence when the arrest occurred. (Tr. 15) \nIn December 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while \nintoxicated (DWI) and failure to stop/elude the police. (Answer at 1) The failure to \nstop/elude the police charge was nolle prossed. (GE 10 at 7) He was found guilty of the \nDWI charge, given a 30-day suspended jail sentence, and placed on probation for 12 \nmonths. As part of probation, his license was suspended and he had to attend an alcohol \nsafety program. Also, the court ordered the installation of an ignition lock on Applicant\u2019s car \nfor six months. (Answer at 1) \nIn January 2016, while on probation, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. \nSubsequently, he was found guilty and given a one-year suspended jail sentence, two \nyears supervised probation, fined $1,500, and ordered to attend six months of alcohol \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ncounseling. (Answer at 2; GE 2 at 6) Applicant completed the requirements of probation. \n(GE 2 at 7) Per the lead counselor of the alcohol program, Applicant \u201cwas an attentive and \nactive participant, and contributed with good thoughts in group session,\u201d and it appeared \n\u201cthat he ha[d] gained knowledge on the consequences of alcohol . . . in his life.\u201d (GE 7 at 2) \nApplicant stopped drinking alcohol after this most recent DUI arrest, and continues to \nremain sober. (Tr. 28) He included his DUI charges on his 2018 security clearance \napplication, as required. (GE 1 at 34-37) \nIn April 2017, Applicant was issued a citation for violating the terms of parole by \nattempting to drive on a suspended license. (GE 8 at 7) Applicant denies this allegation, \ncontending that his license was not suspended; rather, it was turned in to the motor vehicle \nadministration when he moved to another state and applied for a new license. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant did not provide any documentation in support of this contention. He was found \nguilty. \nIn August 2019, Applicant was charged with displaying a registered plate issued for \nanother vehicle. He was found guilty and fined $70. (GE 9 at 19) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in February 2018. He \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to a question requiring applicants to disclose any debts that were more than \n120 days past due, as of the execution date of the security clearance application. (GE 1 at \n41) When Applicant completed the application, he was more than 120 days delinquent on \nmortgage payments for a rental property that he owned. (Tr. 30) Specifically, Applicant \npurchased the property in 2000. (GE 2 at 6) After he left the Army and joined the Air Force \nin 2003, Applicant moved, but kept the property to rent out. (Tr. 21) In approximately 2012, \nthe tenant moved out, at or about the time Applicant\u2019s wife lost her job. (Tr. 21; GE 4 at 3) \nUnable to find another tenant and unable to pay the mortgage without receiving rent money \nto offset it, the mortgage became delinquent. Applicant knew that he and his wife had been \nstruggling to make mortgage payments, but \u201cdidn\u2019t know the exact extent of it,\u201d as his wife \nwas handling the payments and the property was located in another state. (Tr. 32 - 33) At \nthe time of the foreclosure, payments had been delinquent for approximately six years. (GE \n4 at 3) \n \n  \n \nBy November 2019, the mortgage loan had been foreclosed upon, and the home \nwas sold at auction. (GE 5 at 1) Applicant owed no deficiency after the sale. (Tr. 35; GE 5 \nat 3) \nApplicant is indebted on an auto loan account that was charged off in the amount of \n$3,837. He incurred this debt in 2018 when he took his car to an auto shop for repairs and \ncould not afford the repair cost. (Tr. 22, 38) Applicant disputed the repair cost amount to \nthe shop owner, and \u201cthey basically ended up selling the car at an auction.\u201d (Tr. 38) The \nauto lender received the proceeds of the sale. (Tr. 22) \nApplicant is indebted to a collection agent for a delinquent phone bill, totaling \n$1,182. Applicant denies the debt.

Applicant\u2019s \nadult children and his grandchild live in his home. He helps his children pay their college \ntuition. (Tr. 40-41) According to his wife, he is \u201ca strong and stable, husband, father, friend, \nand provider who has always worked hard to make sure that [his] family always had \neverything that [they] needed and many of the things that [they] wanted.\u201d (AE A at 1) \nMoreover, he has \u201clearned from his mistakes . . .,\u201d and has become \u201can even better \nperson,\u201d over the years. (AE A at 2) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nUnder this guideline, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21) Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests \ntrigger disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, \nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related arrest was nearly seven years ago in \nJanuary 2016. Per the counselor who worked with Applicant after this arrest, he was \nactively engaged in the counseling sessions and appeared to have gained knowledge of \nthe consequences of alcohol abuse in his life. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso \nmuch time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or judgement,\u201d applies. Applicant has mitigated the \nalcohol consumption security concern. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness [and] by its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG 30) Although \nApplicant mitigated the DUI charges, as discussed in the section above, the remaining \ncharges, in tandem, trigger the application of AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca pattern of minor offenses, any \none of which on its own would be unlikely to affect a national security security eligibility \ndecision, but which in combination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Also, Applicant\u2019s citation for driving on a suspended license in \ncontravention of the terms of parole triggers the application of AG \u00b6 \u201cviolation or revocation \nof parole or probation, or failures to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation program,\u201d \napplies. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent criminal violation occurred more than three years ago. \nUnder these circumstances, AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d applies. Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct security concern. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201c[c]conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201c[o]f special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of arrests is mitigated for the same reasons as discussed in \nalcohol consumption and criminal conduct sections, discussed above. \nApplicant\u2019s omission of his delinquent mortgage from his security clearance \napplication, however, raises the issue of whether the personal conduct concerns under AG \n\u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d \napplies. Applicant\u2019s inclusion of other derogatory information on his security clearance \napplication, bolsters the credibility of his contention that the omission of the mortgage debt \nwas an unintentional oversight. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) The creditor of the debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 4.d is not identified, and the \namount allegedly overdue is not specified. Given the vagueness of this allegation and \nApplicant\u2019s denial, I resolve it in his favor. \nThe remaining debts trigger the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts;\u201d \nand AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant disputes the debt \nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c, but provided no documentary evidence substantiating \nthe basis of the dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue,\u201d is not applicable. \nApplicant incurred the most significant debt, the mortgage delinquency on a rental \nproperty during a period when the property was vacant, and at or about the time his wife \nlost her job. Absent the support of his wife, and a paying tenant, he was unable to make \nthe mortgage payments. These circumstances were sufficiently beyond Applicant\u2019s control \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto trigger the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . ..\u201d \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s rental property was foreclosed and sold for an amount that \ncovered what he owed, I have lingering concerns about whether he acted responsibly with \nrespect to this debt. Specifically, although both he and his wife owned the property, he \nclaims he did not know it was delinquent when he completed the security clearance \napplication, despite it being delinquent for six years by then. Similarly, taking a car to the \nshop for repairs and ultimately having it repossessed, at minimum, indicates a lack of \nattentiveness to one\u2019s financial affairs. Consequently, I cannot conclude that Applicant \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. I conclude that the second prong of AG \u00b6 \n20(b), \u201c. . . the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is inapplicable. \nAt the end of the day, it is Applicant\u2019s burden to present evidence establishing that \nhis financial situation is under control. Applicant has not done so. Specifically, he \npresented no evidence of current financial stability, such as a budget or a pay stub, and he \npresented no evidence that he was participating in financial counseling. Moreover, I cannot \nconclude that he no longer owes the disputed debt, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c, \nbecause his dispute was unsupported by documentary evidence. In sum, AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe \nindividual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a legitimate \nand credible source, such as a non-profit counseling service, and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d does not apply. Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nGiven the length of time that has elapsed since Applicant last was arrested or issued \na citation, and the length of time he has been sober, I conclude he has mitigated the \npersonal conduct, criminal conduct, and alcohol consumption security concerns. Applicant \nserved honorably in two branches of the U.S. armed services, collectively for 23 years. \nCurrently, he is working, attending college, helping his children finance their college \neducations, and is helping take care of his granddaughter. These indicia of sound \ncharacter are insufficient, however, to overcome the unmitigated concerns regarding the \nmanagement of his finances. Because Applicant owes no deficiency after the foreclosure, \nand the automobile lien was resolved, I am not concerned as much about his current \nindebtedness. Rather, the amount of time he was unaware the rental property mortgage \nwas not being paid, and the insufficient explanation about how he took his car to the shop \nand it wound up being repossessed, raise questions as to whether his finances are under \ncontrol and whether his delinquent indebtedness will recur. Under these circumstances, I \nconclude that it is not clearly consistent at this time to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a \u2013 4.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant submitted his response to the FORM, with a \nwritten response and Appendix A through D, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant did not object to Government Items 1 through 9, and they are admitted into \nevidence, referenced hereinafter as Government Exhibits 1 through 9. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 29 years old. He is married with no children. He has a Bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer. He is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline M \u2013 Use of Information Technology \nPrior to his current employment, Applicant worked for another defense contractor \nfrom May 2015 to July 2018 at which time, due to his misconduct and violations of \ncompany policies, Applicant agreed to resign in lieu of termination. Applicant began \nworking for his current employer in August 2019. \nThe SOR alleged the following misconduct: \n1.a. On multiple occasions between November 2017 and July 2018 Applicant used his \ncompany computer (laptop) to stream and view pornographic videos and/or images \n(sexually explicit material) in violation of company policy. (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nthe SOR.) \n1.b. Applicant used the \u201cInPrivate Browsing\u201d mode while using the internet explorer \nbrowser to stream and view the explicit pornographic videos and images to evade \ndetection of websites he visited while surfing the internet. The InPrivate Browsing mode \nallowed him to surf the internet without leaving a digital footprint such as the browsing \nhistory, temporary internet files, form data and cookies, which are not retained when the \nbrowser is exited. By using this InPrivate Brower mode, Applicant attempted to conceal \nhis behavior knowing it was in violation of company policy. \n1.c. Applicant introduced malware computer viruses onto the company\u2019s IT System by \nusing his company assigned computer to stream and view pornographic videos and/or \nimages via his YouTube and Instagram accounts. Applicant explained that he realized \nthat he had identified a loophole of sorts where his identity was not associated with his \ninternet browsing. He states that he removed his own access to the resources in a \nvoluntary attempt to end his misconduct on his own, however his misconduct was \nidentified by his employer when he began accessing sexual content through his \npersonal computer\u2019s direct network connection and inadvertently introduced malware. \nHe states that it was through the remote server and desktop emulator that he was able \nto access sexually explicit content at work without discovery dating back to 2017. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n2.a.  See the discussion set forth in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.c. above. \n2.b. \nIn July 2018 Applicant provided false or misleading statements to company \nofficials who were investigating his acts of misconduct described above in \nsubparagraphs 1.a, and 1.c. \nApplicant changed his response only after being \nconfronted with evidence substantiating his misconduct. \n2.c. At the conclusion of the company\u2019s investigation, Applicant was given an option to \nresign in lieu of being terminated form employment for his acts of misconduct described \nabove.  Applicant opted to resign.  He is not eligible for rehire. \n2.d. Applicant provided false or misleading statements to the Department of Defense \ninvestigators during his interviews in February and March 2020, by stating that he \nthought because the site was not blocked, it was acceptable to view content from the \nsite; when in fact he knew viewing explicit content of this sort was not acceptable and \nthat others had gotten into trouble for viewing similar content. \n2.e. Applicant completed a security clearance application dated March 29, 2019, and \nDecember 6, 2019. \nIn response to Section 13A, which asked him about his \n\u201cEmployment Activities,\u201d Applicant provided the reason for leaving his previous \nemployment as there being no long-term career path following an incident involving an \ninadvertent accessing of malware embedded in a YouTube video while at work. He \nstated that he had no knowledge that the YouTube video had malware embedded, or \nthat one could embed malware in a YouTube video. Applicant was not truthful in his \nresponse. \nApplicant failed to state the true reason he left. \nHe left in lieu being \nterminated. Applicant took the option to resign in lieu of being terminated for cause by \nhis company for acts of misconduct described in paragraph 1, above. \n2.f. \nThe same questionnaire, also asked Applicant under Section 13A, entitled, \n\u201cReceived Discipline or Warning\u201d, about the particulars of the discipline he received. \nApplicant stated that he was suspended with pay for roughly two weeks for the incident, \nand that the investigation into the incident with malware was accessed via a YouTube \nvideo. Applicant claims that the suspension was with pay, and that it was therefore not \nconsidered to be an action of formal discipline by the company. He further stated that \nhe wanted to be honest and forthcoming with his answer. Applicant was not truthful in \nhis response. Applicant\u2019s misconduct instigated a formal investigation that concluded \nthat he violated company policy, resulting in his job termination. In lieu of termination, \nApplicant was suspended without pay during the investigation period, and the company \nwould have fired him for cause had he not taken the option they gave him to resign. \nApplicant now acknowledges his sexual addiction, which he believes stems from \nhis childhood trauma of being molested. He admits that he initially attempted to deny \nhis behavior and tried to maintain secrecy until he could no longer keep his problem \nsecret. He admits now that he always knew his actions were wrong, and in violation of \ncompany policy. He lied to investigators not only to avoid the consequences of his \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactions, but to avoid the shame, pain, and embarrassment of being in front of others \nand having them know his situation. (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \nHe states that he currently attends bi-weekly therapy sessions with his certified \nsexual addiction therapist/counselor, who helps him to actively pursue health and \nfreedom. He is a member of a sexual addiction support group, is working the program, \nand is accountable to other group members. After living with his addiction for many \nyears, he believes he has successfully broken the addictive cycle thanks to the help and \nsupport of his counselors, support group, and personal support network. He stated that \nhe is committed to ongoing sexual health. (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \nA letter from Applicant\u2019s counselor dated February 15, 2022, indicates that \nApplicant was referred by the pastor of his church for his long-standing pornography \naddiction. \nApplicant received a total of eleven sessions of individual or marriage \ncounseling between February 27, 2017, and February 7, 2022, when his attorney \nrequested a summary of the counseling. Applicant is said to have made progress with \nhis addiction before his wife moved out of state. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \nA letter from Applicant\u2019s biblical counselor, who provided help to Applicant from \n2017 to 2019, indicates that in his opinion, Applicant has stopped engaging in \npornography and now realizes the wrong, foolishness, and harm it has caused to his \nwife and others. Applicant also appears to understand the dangers pornography can \nhave to his personal and professional life. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)  \nNumerous letters of recommendation from various individuals who know the \nApplicant well, and some of whom have worked closely with Applicant attest to his \nexemplary behavior, integrity, reliability and trustworthiness. \nThey all support his \nrequest for access to classified information. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits O through X.) \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals for the periods from 2020 and 2021, reflect \nratings of \u201cexceeds expectations.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information Technology \nis set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information.  Information technology includes any computer-based \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information.  This includes any component, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n (a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n \n (e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \nAG \u00b6 41 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable here. \nApplicant used his \ncompany laptop to view pornography on company property while at work. He knew it \nwas a violation of company policy, and he attempted to conceal his misconduct. He \nused the InPrivate Browsing Mode to surf the internet to stream and view explicit \nmaterial without being identified. Applicant also introduced malware viruses onto the \ncompany IT system. Although there is no evidence that he has done this recently, the \nbehavior is so egregious, it continues to casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment.  Accordingly, this guideline is found against the Applicant. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n     \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.   \n. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of; \n(2) any disruptive, violent or other inappropriate behavior;  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e)  personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.  Such conduct \nincludes:  \nApplicant deliberately lied on his security clearance application in March 2019, in \nresponse to questions in Section 13A, about his reasons for leaving his past \nemployment, and whether he received a discipline or warning for misconduct. This \nmisconduct raises the above security concerns. \nThere are conditions mitigating security concerns under AG \u00b6 17. However, \nnone of them are applicable here: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nIn response to question 13A, Applicant was not candid or completely truthful in \nhis response to his reason for leaving the job. He stated that there was no long-term \npath, and that the incident involved an inadvertent accessing of malware embedded in a \nYouTube video at work. \nThere was no mention of the fact that he was being \ninvestigated for violations of company policy, or what the violations entailed, and that in \nlieu of being terminated, he was given the option to leave or resign. \nFurthermore, he was not candid or truthful in response to the question in 13A, \nconcerning his discipline or warning for his misconduct. Applicant stated that he was \nsuspended with pay for two weeks, and that it was not considered to be an action of \nformal discipline. In the event that Applicant did not consider his discipline to be a \nformal punitive action, he was wrong. His employer may not have wanted to ruin his \ncareer elsewhere, but common sense dictates that if he was no longer qualified to work \nfor his employer, his misconduct was considered very serious. During the investigation, \nApplicant was suspended without pay, and then he would have been fired for cause, \nhad he not taken the option to resign. \nThere is nothing more punitive than this. \nApplicant should have been completely truthful in responding to this question. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines M, and E, in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s misconduct is \negregious and unacceptable. Using his company computer to view pornography is in \nviolation of company policy. InPrivate Browsing and any other modes of accessing the \ninternet without leaving a digital footprint is intolerable. Introducing malware to the \ncompany IT system is dangerous. In leiu of being terminated from his employment he \nopted to resign. Furthermore, he has not been truthful or candid with the Government \nduring their investigations and on his security clearance application. Based upon the \nfacts and analysis set forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Use of Information Technology, and Personal \nConduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline M: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a. \nAgainst Applicant. \nSubparagraph 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant. \nSubparagraph 1.c. \nAgainst Applicant. \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.d. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.f. \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated financial consideration concerns.

(GEs 1-5) Applicant relied on one \nwitness (herself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 9, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with creditor checks and \nendorsements. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 calendar days to \nsupplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded five days to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with endorsements \nand an email covering her unsuccessful efforts to address her $15,060 vehicle debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and her $4,464 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) with her creditor contacts, but \nwithout success in obtaining helpful identifying information from either creditor. \nReportedly, neither creditor could find the debts in their respective systems. Applicant\u2019s \nendorsements are attached and admitted as AE A. \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant accumulated five delinquent medical \nand consumer debts exceeding $20,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been \nresolved. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\u00ad\n1.d), but denied the remaining two debts with explanations. She claimed she never \nreceived bills for the debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. Addressing SOR \u00b6 1.a, she \nclaimed she could not find the $15,060 SOR \u00b6 1.a debt on her credit report. In her \nfollow-up remarks about SOR creditor \u00b6 1.d, she claimed she could not obtain any \nhelpful information from either the hospital or insurance carrier on the covered $4,464 \nmedical debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 50-year-old logistics planner of a defense contractor who seeks a. \nsecurity clearance.

(GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nIn April 2013, Applicant purchased a vehicle for a little over $15,000, according to \nher October 2019 credit report. (GEs 2-4) She estimates to have made about nine \npayments on her car loan before she began encountering difficulties in making her car \npayments. (Tr. 29-32) Once her hours were reduced by her employer, she found she \ncould no longer afford the vehicle. (Tr. 29-32) \nStill, applicant continued to make her car payments and tried to work out a \npayment plan with the lender in 2013 that would reduce her car payments and permit \nher to keep the car. (Tr. 33) Told that her only option was to turn in the car if she could \nnot make the payments, she consented to having her car picked up by the lender. (Tr. \n33-34) Thereafter, she was never told of the vehicle\u2019s sale, or that she still owed money \nto the vendor. (Tr. 34-36) She has had no contact with the vendor since she returned \nthe vehicle. (Tr. 35) The estimated deficiency balance on the returned vehicle was \n$15,060. (GEs 2 and 4) \nBesides Applicant\u2019s SOR creditor 1.a vehicle debt, Applicant accumulated \nseveral medical debts that are reported by her creditors as delinquent. (GEs 2-4) The \nreported debts are covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e as follows: 1.b ( for $4,464); 1.c (for \n$106), 1.d (for $529), and 1.e ($372). \nApplicant acknowledged the SOR 1.b debt (reported on her earlier credit reports) \nas a debt she incurred in connection with an emergency procedure her daughter \nunderwent in 2018. (GE 4; Tr. 36-38, 43) She believes the debt was covered by her \nmedical insurance carrier (either through her old or newest policy), but is not sure \nwhether the bill was ever paid by either carrier. (Tr. 38-39) The listed medical debt is not \nlisted in her most recent August 2021 credit report. (GE 5) \nThe remaining two medical debts listed in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d) were never \nbilled to Applicant, and she does not know whether they were ever paid by her \ninsurance carrier. (Tr. 41-42) A final debt listed in the SOR is a reported utility debt in \nthe amount of $372. (GEs 2-4) Applicant cannot account for this debt, and she assured \nthat she has never had a cable or similar service account.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.

Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Applicant expressed no awareness of any of the reported delinquency balances \ncarried by these creditors. She was never billed by any of the creditors covered by the \nSOR and is currently up to date with all of her accounts. \nFinancial concerns \nCredit reports reveal that Applicant\u2019s five reported delinquent debts remain \nunaddressed and unresolved. These debt delinquencies warrant the application of two \nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligation.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s three admitted debts with explanations and clarifications require no \nindependent proof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick \non Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). Her admitted debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  \nApplicant\u2019s cited income limitations impaired her ability to make her timely \nmonthly payments on the vehicle she purchased in 2013. Unable to work out more \nfavorable payment arrangements with her lender, she returned the vehicle to the vendor \nin late 2013 after making nine monthly payments. \nNever receiving any notice of sale and credited proceeds (if any) from the sale of \nthe vehicle, she presumed the remaining loan balance on the vehicle was satisfied from \nthe sale proceeds. From the credit reports produced, it is unclear whether any sale \nproceeds were ever credited to Applicant\u2019s loan balance on the returned vehicle. \nApplication of mitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has partial application to any \nremaining delinquent loan balance covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a, as well as the emergency \nmedical procedure required for Applicant\u2019s daughter that is covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nReported medical debts associated with emergency and other procedures for \nApplicant\u2019s daughter, and covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d, were never billed to Applicant \nand presumably were paid by one or more of her insurance carriers.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                 \n \n                                          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 16, 2021, and requested a hearing. \nThis case was assigned to me on November 30, 2021. A hearing was scheduled for \nFebruary 22, 2022, via TEAMS, and was heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, \nthe Government\u2019s case consisted of five exhibits. (GEs 1-5) Applicant relied on one \nwitness (herself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 9, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with creditor checks and \nendorsements. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 calendar days to \nsupplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded five days to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with endorsements \nand an email covering her unsuccessful efforts to address her $15,060 vehicle debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and her $4,464 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) with her creditor contacts, but \nwithout success in obtaining helpful identifying information from either creditor. \nReportedly, neither creditor could find the debts in their respective systems. Applicant\u2019s \nendorsements are attached and admitted as AE A. \n  Summary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant accumulated five delinquent medical \nand consumer debts exceeding $20,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been \nresolved. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-\n1.d), but denied the remaining two debts with explanations. She claimed she never \nreceived bills for the debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. Addressing SOR \u00b6 1.a, she \nclaimed she could not find the $15,060 SOR \u00b6 1.a debt on her credit report. In her \nfollow-up remarks about SOR creditor \u00b6 1.d, she claimed she could not obtain any \nhelpful information from either the hospital or insurance carrier on the covered $4,464 \nmedical debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d   \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 50-year-old logistics planner of a defense contractor who seeks a. \nsecurity clearance.

(GE 1; Tr. 48) Previously, she worked for other employers in various \ntypes of customer service and clerical positions. (GE 1) She reported unemployment \nbetween October 2015 and April 2016. (GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nIn April 2013, Applicant purchased a vehicle for a little over $15,000, according to \nher October 2019 credit report. (GEs 2-4) She estimates to have made about nine \npayments on her car loan before she began encountering difficulties in making her car \npayments. (Tr. 29-32) Once her hours were reduced by her employer, she found she \ncould no longer afford the vehicle. (Tr. 29-32) \nStill, applicant continued to make her car payments and tried to work out a \npayment plan with the lender in 2013 that would reduce her car payments and permit \nher to keep the car. (Tr. 33) Told that her only option was to turn in the car if she could \nnot make the payments, she consented to having her car picked up by the lender. (Tr. \n33-34) Thereafter, she was never told of the vehicle\u2019s sale, or that she still owed money \nto the vendor. (Tr. 34-36) She has had no contact with the vendor since she returned \nthe vehicle. (Tr. 35) The estimated deficiency balance on the returned vehicle was \n$15,060. (GEs 2 and 4) \nBesides Applicant\u2019s SOR creditor 1.a vehicle debt, Applicant accumulated \nseveral medical debts that are reported by her creditors as delinquent. (GEs 2-4) The \nreported debts are covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e as follows: 1.b ( for $4,464); 1.c (for \n$106), 1.d (for $529), and 1.e ($372). \nApplicant acknowledged the SOR 1.b debt (reported on her earlier credit reports) \nas a debt she incurred in connection with an emergency procedure her daughter \nunderwent in 2018. (GE 4; Tr. 36-38, 43) She believes the debt was covered by her \nmedical insurance carrier (either through her old or newest policy), but is not sure \nwhether the bill was ever paid by either carrier. (Tr. 38-39) The listed medical debt is not \nlisted in her most recent August 2021 credit report. (GE 5) \nThe remaining two medical debts listed in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d) were never \nbilled to Applicant, and she does not know whether they were ever paid by her \ninsurance carrier. (Tr. 41-42) A final debt listed in the SOR is a reported utility debt in \nthe amount of $372. (GEs 2-4) Applicant cannot account for this debt, and she assured \nthat she has never had a cable or similar service account. (Tr. 39-40) Her explanations \nare credible and accepted. \nApplicant explained that her listed SOR debts are not the result of overspending, \nbut due to her loss of income.

(AE A) \n  Policies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \n     Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.

Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Applicant expressed no awareness of any of the reported delinquency balances \ncarried by these creditors. She was never billed by any of the creditors covered by the \nSOR and is currently up to date with all of her accounts. \nFinancial concerns \nCredit reports reveal that Applicant\u2019s five reported delinquent debts remain \nunaddressed and unresolved. These debt delinquencies warrant the application of two \nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligation.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s three admitted debts with explanations and clarifications require no \nindependent proof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick \non Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). Her admitted debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).

Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited income limitations impaired her ability to make her timely \nmonthly payments on the vehicle she purchased in 2013. Unable to work out more \nfavorable payment arrangements with her lender, she returned the vehicle to the vendor \nin late 2013 after making nine monthly payments. \nNever receiving any notice of sale and credited proceeds (if any) from the sale of \nthe vehicle, she presumed the remaining loan balance on the vehicle was satisfied from \nthe sale proceeds. From the credit reports produced, it is unclear whether any sale \nproceeds were ever credited to Applicant\u2019s loan balance on the returned vehicle. \nApplication of mitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has partial application to any \nremaining delinquent loan balance covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a, as well as the emergency \nmedical procedure required for Applicant\u2019s daughter that is covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nReported medical debts associated with emergency and other procedures for \nApplicant\u2019s daughter, and covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d, were never billed to Applicant \nand presumably were paid by one or more of her insurance carriers. Applicant\u2019s credible \nexplanations of these reported delinquent medical debts are covered by MC \u00b6 20(e), \n\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt \nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d MC \u00b6 20(e), is \nalso available to Applicant in connection with the reported utility service debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e) she incurred without ever receiving any services supporting the debt. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

(\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and \n2.a.) He qualified his admission to \u00b6 1.b, that alleged he had used THC while granted access to \nclassified information, with the qualification \u201cif that\u2019s what I wrote then I admit.\u201d There is no \nevidence in the record that Applicant wrote (or stated) that he had used marijuana while holding \na security clearance or while having access to classified information. He did not specifically admit \nor deny \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, and 4.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. (Item 1) \nApplicant is 59 years old. He married in 1992 and divorced in 2013, and currently lives \nwith a cohabitant. Since September 2018, Applicant has been employed by a defense \ncontractor. Applicant listed on his April 2019 SCA that he previously held a DOD security \nclearance in approximately 1982. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) showed that \nApplicant had been granted a secret security clearance in February 2006. There is no other \nevidence that was submitted to show the specific period of time Applicant possessed his security \nclearance, whether it was for one month, one year, or if Applicant continuously held the security \nclearance from February 2006 through January 2013. (Items 3, 4 and 6) \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant smoked marijuana (THC) with varying \nfrequency from about January 1979 to January 2013. His heaviest use occurred during his high \nschool years and he used marijuana occasionally in his 30s and 40s. Over the course of his life \nApplicant estimated he has used marijuana on about 100 occasions. He used LSD and \npsilocybin mushrooms (hallucinogens) from about 1979 to 2005. His heaviest use occurred in \nhigh school, but he did use these substances again in his 40s. Applicant used cocaine from 1985 \nto 1995. He experimented with this drug and never enjoyed the experience. Over the course of \nten years he used cocaine about ten times. He has no plans to use any of these illegal \nsubstances in the future. (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4) \nApplicant self-reported his illegal drug history on the SCA he signed in April 2019. He \nlisted that he had not used any illegal drugs while he held a DOD security clearance. During his \nbackground interview in June 2019, which was certified by Applicant in November 2020, he told \nthe investigator that he had not used any illegal substance while holding a security clearance. \nApplicant also responded to an interrogatory question which specifically asked whether he had \nused any illegal drugs after he had been granted a security clearance in February 2006. \nApplicant responded; \u201cNo.\u201d (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4) \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in February 2006, about eight months after \nhe had been hired by a different federal contractor.

According to Applicant\u2019s admissions, his \nuse of marijuana until January 2013 overlapped with his employment and possession of a \nsecurity clearance if he held it continuously from February 2006 until he left the employment \nposition in September 2015. JPAS reflected the date the security clearance was issued, but it \ndid not reflect the length of time Applicant possessed the security clearance. (Items 3 and 6) \nUnder Guideline G it alleged that Applicant was arrested in March 2017 for Driving Under \nthe Influence of Alcohol. (DUI) He was found guilty and was sentenced to restricted driving \nprivileges for six months, to serve eight days in the Sheriff\u2019s work program, completion of an \nalcohol education program, fined about $1,900, and he was placed on three years of probation. \nThis alcohol-related allegation (\u00b6 2.a) and all of the allegations under Guideline H (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.d) were cross-alleged under Guideline J (\u00b6 3.a). The allegation that Applicant used marijuana \nwhile possessing a security clearance (\u00b6 1.b) was cross-alleged under Guideline E (\u00b6 4.a). (Items \n1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) \nApplicant told the investigator during his June 2019 background interview that this arrest \nin 2017 was his only alcohol-related arrest. He successfully completed his court-ordered alcohol \neducation program and was not recommended to participate in any other alcohol treatment. He \nconsumed alcohol about three times weekly from the age of 21 until November 2015, when his \nmother passed away. After November 2015 he consumed a greater volume of alcohol more \nfrequently. He would consume a couple glasses of wine and on occasion, a shot of bourbon. \nAfter his March 2017 DUI arrest, he greatly reduced his alcohol consumption. He told the \ninvestigator that he did not have a problem with alcohol and the 2017 DUI was an isolated \nincident. In the 2020 interrogatories, Applicant reported that he completely stopped all use of \nalcohol in October 2019. He also quit smoking tobacco for health, spiritual, and mental reasons. \n(Item 4) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the Supreme Court \nheld, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security determinations should err, if they \nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process \nis a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security \nis the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and \nbased on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends normal \nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead \nto physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 and \nthe following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about January 1979 to January \n2013. He also used LSD and psilocybin mushrooms from about 1979 to 2005, and cocaine from \nabout 1985 to 1995. There is insufficient evidence to support that Applicant used marijuana while \nhe was in possession of a security clearance. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26.

Applicant denied that he had used \nany illegal drug while holding a security clearance, and he had no intention of using any illegal \ndrug in the future. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant used \nmarijuana while he was in possession of a security clearance. Applicant was forthright about his \npast illegal drug use during his security clearance investigation, and is unlikely to resume his \nuse of marijuana, or any other illegal drug. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 provides one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents \nof concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use or whether \nthe individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant had a misdemeanor-level alcohol-related offense in 2017. AG \u00b6 22(a) is \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists one condition that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s single alcohol-related arrest almost five years ago \nis not recent and does not demonstrate a pattern of questionable judgment. After his successful \ncompletion of the court-ordered alcohol education in 2017, there is no indication that Applicant \nwas recommended to obtain additional alcohol treatment. In October 2019, Applicant decided to \nmake a lifestyle change and has completely abstained from using alcohol. I conclude that his \nisolated alcohol-related misconduct happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current judgment. Applicant successfully \nmitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any of which on their own would be unlikely to \naffect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.  \nApplicant admitted his illegal drug use and the 2017 alcohol-related criminal offense. AG \n\u00b6 31(a) applies. \nCriminal conduct security concerns may be mitigated under AG \u00b6 32. The following are \npotentially applicable in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.  \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence of additional misconduct alleged under Guideline J. The SOR \nallegations under Guidelines H and G were cross-alleged under this Guideline. Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct is related to his illegal drug use and his 2017 alcohol-related offense. For the \nsame reasons previously addressed under those Guidelines, this misconduct is also mitigated \nunder Guideline J. The record evidence shows that the misconduct occurred in the distant past, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has no intention of using illegal drugs in the future, and he is not currently consuming \nalcohol. I find that future drug-related or alcohol-related criminal misconduct is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. Applicant successfully mitigated the criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and \ncandid answers during the national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while possessing a security clearance was specifically \naddressed under Guideline H, and cross-alleged under Guideline E. I previously concluded this \nallegation was not supported by sufficient evidence. No other personal conduct allegations were \nraised beyond this cross-allegation. Applicant has successfully refuted personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nrelevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated \nmy comments under Guidelines H, G, J, and E and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this whole-person \nanalysis. \nApplicant is 59 years old. He married in 1992 and divorced in 2013, and currently lives \nwith a cohabitant. Since September 2018, Applicant has been employed by a defense \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontractor. Applicant listed on his April 2019 SCA that he previously held a DOD security \nclearance in approximately 1982. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) showed that \nApplicant had been granted a secret security clearance in February 2006. There is no other \nevidence in the record to show the specific period of time Applicant possessed his security \nclearance. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use occurred long ago. He disclosed his illegal drug use on the \n2019 SCA, and discussed it fully during his background interview. He has no intention of using \nillegal drugs in the future. He had an isolated alcohol-related offense in 2017. He fully complied \nwith the conditions set by the court, and after completing his alcohol education program, he was \nnot referred for any other alcohol treatment. In October 2019, Applicant made a lifestyle decision \nto completely abstain from using alcohol. His actions show responsible behavior and good \njudgment. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that \ndrug use, alcohol consumption, and criminal conduct security concerns are mitigated, and the \npersonal conduct security concerns refuted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPamela C.

The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 17, 2022, \nscheduling the hearing for June 26, 2022, using Microsoft Teams. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant testified and \noffered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through T. There were no objections to any of the evidence \noffered and it was admitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript on August 4, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 3.a and 4.a. She \ndenied the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.b. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of \nfact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 25 years old. She graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nDecember 2019. She then pursued and completed a professional certificate in 2021 and \nwas accepted into a master\u2019s program, which began in August 2022. She married in 2022 \nand has no children. She began college in 2015. In about May 2017, she moved to a \ndifferent state and transferred to a local college in her new state. She also worked part-\ntime as an intern for her present employer, a federal contractor, until she graduated from \ncollege in December 2019. After graduation, she was offered a full-time position by her \npresent employer and has worked for them since January 2020. (Tr. 23-29; GE 1; AE F, \nJ, L, M, N) \nFrom approximately September 2015 to May 2017, Applicant used marijuana with \nvarying frequency. She was 18 to 20 years old at the time. She smoked marijuana with \nfriends. She stopped using marijuana when she moved to the new state and distanced \nherself from the friends with whom she was using it. She credibly testified that she has \nnot used marijuana or any other illegal drug since May 2017 and does not intend to do so \nin the future. When she got married, her wedding was in the state where she previously \nlived, and none of her former friends were invited to her wedding. Her husband does not \nuse illegal drugs. She provided a hair follicle drug analysis from June 29, 2022, with \nnegative results for illegal drugs. (Tr. 42-47; AE O) \nIn August 2016, Applicant was in a car with friends when it was stopped by the \npolice. Marijuana was found in the car. Applicant testified it did not belong to her. She and \nthe other occupants were arrested. She was charged with possession of marijuana with \nthe intent to use. She stated she was confused about the arrest and that is why she denied \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. She said when she went to court a couple of days after the incident, she was \ntold the charges were dismissed. She did not go before a judge or meet with anyone from \nthe prosecutor\u2019s office.

In her first semester of her \nsophomore year, she received a D in a course. She felt she deserved a better grade. She \nhad to retake the class in the spring semester and felt the situation was unfair, which \ncaused her not to take the course seriously. On her first test, she received a failing grade. \nShe tried to make up for it, but received a failing grade on her second exam. She knew \neven if she scored 100% on her final exam, she would still fail the course. At the time, \nshe was working part time in the Office of Information Technology (OIT) at XU. She stated \nthat before considering the ramifications and consequences of her actions, she thought \nshe could use her access in the OIT to change her grade, which she did. In her SOR \nanswer, she said she then felt guilty and an hour later she emailed her professor telling \nher that Applicant\u2019s grade was incorrectly put in the system. Her professor thanked her \nand corrected the grade. She did not tell the professor that it was her who changed the \ngrade. Two days later, she was summoned to the OIT by managers who confronted her \nwith what she had done. They reported her conduct to XU and the police. She said in her \nSOR answer that she was unaware that her conduct could lead to serious criminal \nallegations. She attributed her actions to being immature and she had no excuse. (Tr. 48-\n49, 73-79; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant testified about the specifics of her actions. She gained access to the \nprofessor\u2019s portal and changed the password on the professor\u2019s account so she could \nchange the grade. The professor was notified that her password changed and notified the \nOIT asking why it had changed. When the OIT became aware, they investigated the \naction, which was traced back to Applicant\u2019s computer and the time she was working. \nApplicant testified she was aware of the rules and protocol of working in the OIT and her \nconduct was a violation. When Applicant was confronted by the manager of the OIT \nregarding changing the password, she initially denied it and did not take responsibility for \nher conduct. She also denied it to the XU conduct board. At her hearing, she testified that \nXU conducted an investigation and she was suspended from school at the end of the \nsemester for six months. She received an F in the course. She was permitted to complete \nher other courses before the suspension. She said she was humiliated and embarrassed. \n(Tr. 48-49, 73-79) \nIn March 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with accessing, falsifying or \ntampering with data or computer records, a felony, for her actions at XU. She did not tell \nher parents until months later. A public defender represented her. The prosecutor agreed \nto accept a Pretrial Intervention (PTI) program, which lasted 30 months. She was on \nprobation and had to contact her probation officer, participate in drug testing, and not \ncommit any offenses. She was able to move to a new state while still on probation, but \nhad to continue to contact her probation officer and was required to notify the probation \nofficer if she got into any trouble. (Tr. 50-53, 79-84) \nIn June 2018, while still participating in the PTI and working as an intern with her \nemployer, Applicant was arrested for shoplifting. She admits her conduct was selfish and \nlacked good judgment. She walked into a department store, grabbed four purses, put a \nsmall one in her purse, put another over her shoulder, tried to hide one and said the other \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                          \n \nshe did not try to hide.

He was upset. She called a bail bondsman, paid the bond, \nand was released. She testified that she immediately contacted her probation officer and \ntold the officer of her arrest. When she returned to court for the charge, the official from \nthe store failed to appear and the charge was dismissed. She testified that she thought \nshe got away with it and did it again as noted below. (Tr. 52, 84-89) \nIn October 2018, Applicant was arrested again for shoplifting. She went into a large \nretail store, put items in her cart and went through the self-checkout aisle. She purchased \nthe items and grabbed extra plastic shopping bags. After completing her purchase and \nbefore leaving the store, she went back through the store and filled the bags with items. \nShe then left the store with items she stole and drove away. She was subsequently \nstopped by the police and was arrested. She testified she did this one other time at the \nsame store about a month earlier and got away with it. She also did it once when she was \nin high school, got caught, but she was not arrested and was released by the store.1 (Tr. \n55, 89-92) \nApplicant testified that she reported the second shoplifting incident to her probation \nofficer. She admitted that after her first shoplifting arrest, she felt she got away with it \nwithout consequences after the charge was dropped. In her answer to the SOR, she \nstated that when she went to court for the October 2018 offense, she asked the judge if \nthere was a diversion program she could participate in that would help her with her \n\u201ckleptomania-like tendencies\u201d: She entered a Pretrial Diversion (PTD) program that \nincluded classes focused on shoplifting. She said it changed her life and forced her to \nthink about why she was doing destructive things and how her actions impacted other\u2019s \nlives and property. She completed the program in December 2018 and the charge was \ndismissed. (Tr. 55-57, 92-93; AE R) \nApplicant testified that as part of the PTD program it was recommended that she \nseek therapy, which she did through her college counseling services. She said she \nattended therapy about once a month for about a year. Discussions were about why she \nwas struggling, adjusting to a new area, family expectations, and feelings of entitlement. \n(Tr. 107-114) \nApplicant completed the PTI program in November 2019 and the felony charge \nwas dismissed. In October 2021, this charge was expunged under the same order as her \n2016 drug arrest. (Tr. 54-55; AE P, Q) \nApplicant did not report her criminal conduct of misusing information technology or \nthat she was participating in a PTI program to her employer while she was an intern.

He did not counsel her to report the information to their \nemployer. She testified that she considered reporting it, but did not want to risk an \nopportunity to be hired full time. She testified that she has not been involved in any other \nauthorized computer access since her incident at XU. (Tr. 57-59, 94-98, 106-107) \nApplicant provided a document to show that the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) gave her a fitness/suitability determination where she has access to a level of \nsensitive information.

Applicant testified that Dr. W was not made aware of the SOR \nallegations or her criminal charges. (Tr. 38-40; AE B, K) \nApplicant provided a July 2021 character letter from her direct supervisor at work \nwho has known her for four years. He indicated in his letter that he was aware of \u201cher \nneed for a security clearance.\u201d He has had regular interaction with her since 2018 and \nfrequently on a daily basis. He described her as being a diligent worker with a strong work \nethic and uncompromised integrity. She sets the example for her peers in terms of \ndedication, trustworthiness, reliability, and stability. She received 10 performance awards \nfrom 2020 to 2021, which is unmatched by her peers.

She \nwas responsible for paying her tuition and her father helped her with half of it. She worked \nand went to school at the same time and was responsible for her monthly expenses. (Tr. \n60-62; AE S, T) \nApplicant stated in her Answer to the SOR and testimony that she has received \naccolades for her outstanding performance and awards that were provided as exhibits. \nShe works on important projects that impact the public interest. She volunteers her time \nfor students in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) curriculum \nfor grades kindergarten through 12th  grade as a mentor and judge in competitions. She \nalso mentored an all-girls robotics team. She volunteers at work and participates in \ndifferent teams that help others. (Tr. 62-63) \nApplicant provided a lengthy and detailed Answer to the SOR. In it, she repeatedly \ntakes full responsibility for her conduct and makes no excuses. When testifying she did \nthe same and was candid. She attributed her drug involvement with being around the \nwrong people and has put that in her past. She says she has turned her life around. The \nPTD class forced her to reflect on her life and she saw people like her who were also \nstruggling with their choices. She found it beneficial and it was an epiphany in her life. \nShe attributes her criminal conduct to being young, immature, and selfish. She says she \nis no longer that person, and she has learned her lessons and grown from her mistakes. \nShe is thankful that the system gave her a second chance to restart her life. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana from about September 2015 to May 2017 with varying \nfrequency. She was arrested in August 2016 for possession of marijuana with intent to \nuse. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security. The following \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant credibly testified that she has not used any illegal drug, including \nmarijuana since May 2017. She acknowledged her past uses and no longer associates \nwith any of the people she used drugs with and has moved to a new state. It has been \nover five years since her last use. This is a significant period of time to conclude that \nfuture use is unlikely. In addition, Applicant no longer associates with the friends she \nwould use drugs with and lives in a different state. The above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for use of information technology is \nset out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation.

She was not authorized to access her professor\u2019s computer account and change \nits password and then change her grade for a class. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying condition. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness;  \n(c) The conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was deliberate and intentional and was done for her own self-\ninterest. She was aware of the rules and procedures of the OIT. When she was caught, \nshe denied that she had accessed the computer system to change her grade. She was \narrested and charged with a felony. Her conduct was not minor and did not happen under \nunusual circumstances. It casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. She was aware that her conduct was prohibited. None of the above mitigating \nconditions apply. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn March 2017 Applicant was charged with accessing, falsifying or tampering with \ndata or computer records, a felony. In June 2018, Applicant was arrested for shoplifting. \nIn October 2018, Applicant was again arrested for and charged with shoplifting. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant admitted she accessed her professor\u2019s computer, changed her \nprofessor\u2019s password, and then changed her grade. The fact that she told her professor \nthere was a mistake reflects some of the guilt she was feeling, but she also denied her \nconduct when confronted by OIT and XU. She was on probation for 30 months through a \nPTI program. She was given a second chance. While on probation, in May 2018, she \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nshoplifted. Because the witness failed to appear the charge was dismissed. She was \ngiven a third chance. Instead of realizing that she received a break, she shoplifted again \nfour months later. She asked the judge to participate in a PTD program, which was \ngranted. Applicant attributes her conduct to mistakes and being young, immature, and \nselfish. I have considered that she has been successful at her job and the awards she \nhas received. However, despite being given a second chance under the PTI program, \nshe was not deterred and continued to commit criminal conduct. These offenses are not \nyouthful indiscretions that can be attributed to merely making a mistake or being \nimmature. I have considered that her last offense occurred in October 2018. However, \nApplicant committed three serious offenses, one a felony. All of these offenses are the \ntype that reflect on whether she can be trusted and exercise good judgment. I have also \nconsidered the character letters that Applicant provided and that none of the people are \naware of her criminal conduct. I cannot find that the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe facts alleged under the drug involvement or substance misuse, criminal \nconduct, and the use of information technology guidelines are cross-alleged under the \npersonal conduct guideline. I have mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. The facts detailed above support an adverse determination under both \nthe criminal conduct and use of information technology guidelines and therefore AG \u00b6 \n16(c) does not apply. However, AG \u00b616(e) does apply because Applicant\u2019s personal \nconduct in misusing information technology and shoplifting creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. It is clear that her colleagues are unaware of her \npast criminal conduct, which could be exploited. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct and misuse of technology was not minor and involved \nviolating a trust. The same analysis provided in the above guidelines is applicable here. \nHer conduct casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Applicant \nwas candid in her testimony about her conduct and took responsibility for her actions, but \nattributed them to being immature. These offenses go beyond being immature. She has \nparticipated in counseling to understand her conduct. These are positive acts, but they \ndo not negate the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s past conduct and how they reflect on her \ntrustworthiness. Despite some mitigation, I find Applicant\u2019s personal conduct remains a \nsecurity concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, H, J, and M in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 25 years old. She testified that she believes she has turned her life \naround by making changes. She is excelling at work and has received awards and \naccolades. There is some mitigation through rehabilitation. However, it does not negate \nthe seriousness of her conduct that goes right to the essence of holding a security \nclearance. She failed to meet her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Guideline H drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concern, but failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline M, use of information technology, Guideline J, criminal \nconduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He still \nowned the marital house from his divorce and was responsible for the mortgage payments \nand other monthly expenses associated with it. He stated his financial problems were \nbeyond his control because he had two mortgages to pay. He was not legally responsible \nfor paying her mortgage. He testified that because he was living with her, he felt obligated \nto help pay her mortgage. From June 2018, he paid her mortgage of approximately $800, \nalong with his mortgage payment of $1,200. He sold his marital residence in May 2019 \nand there was a $4,000 deficiency. He borrowed money from his father to pay the \ndeficiency. He repaid him in September 2019.

Applicant testified that she earned 60% of her income during this time. \nShe went back to work recently. Her annual income is approximately $55,000. (Tr. 20-22; \nAE E, F) \nApplicant purchased a motorcycle after his divorce. When he moved in with his \nsecond wife, he was unable to make the $150 monthly payments on the loan (SOR \u00b6 1.e-\n$8,034). The account went into collection status, and Applicant resolved the debt in \nOctober 2021 with a lump-sum payment. He then sold the motorcycle for $3,200 after \npaying the loan. Applicant provided documentary proof the debt is resolved. (Tr. 28-32, \n66-67; AE O) \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($5,319), 1.g ($26,097) and 1.h ($4,827) are \ncharged-off credit card debts. Applicant had difficulty paying these debts when he started \nhelping his wife with her mortgage payments. He contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g and \nrequested it lower the interest rate. He testified that he did not follow up with the creditor \nbecause he then contacted a debt consolidation company to assist him in resolving his \ndebts and was advised not to contact his creditors and to stop making payments. He \nprovided a copy of the contract that he signed in November 2017, which indicated his \nmonthly payments on the $42,636 amount of unsecured debt was $638 a month. He said \nhe made about six to nine months of payments, but then stopped. He testified that he \nlikely had missed monthly payments to these creditors before the advice from the debt \nconsolidation company. Applicant did not provide corroborating documents of his \npayments to the debt consolidation company. He did not contact the other creditors. He \nhas not taken any other action on these debts to resolve them since then. These debts \nhave been delinquent since at least May 2019.

(GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he used the proceeds from the sale of his motorcycle\n($3,200) to pay his tax debt. He provided an IRS document that showed a history of \npayments. It reported that in April 2020 a state income tax levy of $641 was paid for tax \nyear 2016; in January 2021 a $656 payment was applied to a federal tax debt for tax year \n2019; in September 2021 a $405 payment was applied to a federal tax debt for tax year \n2020, and $2,748 was applied to a federal tax debt for tax year 2016. (Tr. 32, 42-45, 64-\n65; AE K) \n \nApplicant testified that he failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal and state \ntax returns because after his divorce he let it slip, and he should have taken care of it. He \ndelayed further because he said the cost of having the returns completed by a tax service \nwas a hindrance. He said he could not afford the $500 it would cost. He said his wife was \npregnant and not working. (Tr. 32-37; AE D, G, H, I, J) \nApplicant testified that he filed his 2017 and 2018 federal and state income tax \nreturns the last week of August 2022, shortly before his hearing. He provided the first \npage of the state tax form for each year, but it does not show that he signed the \ndocuments and the date they were submitted. He said he could not file electronically.

It said it could take up to six weeks to process \nreturns and that he should include with his return any payment due and if he could not \npay the full amount to pay what he could and apply for a payment plan. Applicant did not \nprovide evidence post-hearing that he has made any payments to the IRS. (Tr. 33-45, 64-\n65; AE G, H, R, T, V, W) \nApplicant testified that his financial problems are due to extenuating \ncircumstances. They are his 2017 divorce, child support, his wife not earning her full \nsalary while on medical leave, a new baby, and assuming her mortgage payments and \nher other financial responsibilities. He testified that he and his wife are working through \nthe Dave Ramsey financial program, which they started in the summer of 2021, but \nbecause his wife was out of work they have not been able to pay much. He said he has \na good plan moving forward. He said his failure to file his income tax returns was due to \nhis divorce.

He \nhas never done anything that would be perceived as a threat to national security. He is a \npatriot and would not do anything to harm the country.

He reaffirmed his commitment to protect \nclassified information. (AE S) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. He \nfailed to timely pay his 2016, 2017 and 2019 federal income taxes. He failed to timely file \nhis 2017 and 2018 state income tax returns. Applicant has delinquent debts that began \naccumulating in 2018 that he has not resolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant acknowledged that he failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal and \nstate income tax returns. He was put on notice with the SOR that his delinquent tax issues \nwere a security concern, and he failed to provide corroborating documents to prove that \nthey have been filed. He testified that he owes $9,500 for his 2017 federal taxes and has \nnot paid them or made arrangements with the IRS to pay them. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not \napply. The evidence Applicant provided shows that he paid his delinquent 2016 and 2019 \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntaxes in September 2021, after receipt of the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to these tax years, \nbut it does not fully mitigate the security concerns raised by his failure to comply with the \ntax rules. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his failure to timely file was that after his divorce he let \nthem slip and then later he did not have the money to hire a tax preparer to complete his \nreturns. He attributes his other financial delinquencies to taking over his wife\u2019s mortgage \nwhen he moved in with her along with paying his own mortgage and the amount of his \nchild support. The child support amount was beyond his control. Applicant voluntarily took \nover his wife\u2019s mortgage, knowing he had his own mortgage and other expenses for which \nhe was responsible. That was within his control. Later his wife had medical issues and \nwas only receiving part of her salary, which was beyond his control. For the full application \nof AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibility under the circumstances. \nApplicant has not presented sufficient evidence to conclude he acted responsibly. His \nchild support was reduced in May 2020 from $1,040 to $400. He and his wife used the \nprofit from the sale of her house to purchase a new house before addressing Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues. He did not provide evidence he has made payment arrangements with \nmany of his creditors. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nApplicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and it is resolved. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to this \ndebt. He testified that he attempted to use a debt consolidation company to resolve his \ndebts, but only participated for six to nine months before stopping. He contacted one \ncreditor, but has not taken any other action to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g and \n1.h. He said he paid the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.i, but did not provide documentary evidence. \nApplicant stated he is participating in the Dave Ramsey financial management plan, but \ndid not provide evidence as to what actions he is taking. He did not provide evidence of \ndebts he may have paid or a written budget or plan. AG \u00b6 20(c) has minimal application \nbecause there are not clear indications his financial problems are being resolved or are \nunder control.  \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for two years. \nHe still owes federal income tax and other debts that have not been addressed. His debts \nare recent. He made the financial decision to pay his wife\u2019s mortgage and forego his other \nfinancial responsibilities. His conduct raises issues about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Under the circumstances I cannot conclude it is unlikely to recur. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant neglected to file his 2017 and 2018 federal and state income taxes and \nalso failed to pay his federal income taxes for 2017. Although, he eventually paid his 2016 \nand 2019 federal income taxes, it was not until after he received the SOR. The DOHA \nAppeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C.

His failure to address his other delinquent debts indicates he has an unreliable \nfinancial track record. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n2 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd.

She testified that three large debts \nresulted from vehicle loan defaults after repossessions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.h). She \ncosigned for her children or husband on two loans in possibly 2010 and 2013 (she is \nunsure of when and for whom the loans were made), and the third loan was for her own \nvehicle purchase in about 2018 that was repossessed a year later. \nApplicant has struggled to manage her family finances with her $15 per hour pay \nwith limited overtime.

She hired a nationally advertised tax relief \ncompany to interact with the IRS, and paid $2,000 plus $200 per month for six months \ntoward that effort. She is unsure of the current status, and has not had discussions with \nthe IRS herself. This information was not alleged in the SOR and will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when making a credibility \ndetermination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has a history of debt accumulation with little personal involvement in their \nresolution except for use of a credit repair firm to dispute debts. She attributes her \nfinancial difficulties to a low-paying job and responsibilities for her granddaughter and \ngreat grandson. Although she has employed a credit repair firm, she has shown little \nsuccess in resolving her debts, and failed to show a legitimate basis to dispute the \naccounts. She has a history of financial irresponsibility as evidenced by cosigning loans \nfor people without an intent or ability to pay, and for her own inability or unwillingness to \npay a car loan and other debts. Her financial problems have been longstanding and \nremain a concern. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant has not shown a willingness or ability to address \nher debts despite a history of full employment since 2019. Understandably, she has little \nliquid financial assets available to pay debts. She has not consulted a financial counselor, \nand her credit repair firm has shown little tangible progress toward resolution of the SOR \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s federal tax debt is unresolved, and may be considered in evaluating \nmitigating information and her overall financial responsibility. \nApplicant\u2019s financial status is minimally sufficient to meet her current monthly \nexpenses. She is financially stretched and does not appear to have available assets to \nresolve her current delinquencies, or pay future obligations. Overall, I am not persuaded \nthat she has exhibited financial responsibility and have significant doubts about her intent \nand willingness to resolve her debts now and in the future. No mitigating condition fully \napplies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment status, potential loss of income during COVID-19 cutbacks, and \nfinancial stress due to her household income. However, I remain unconvinced of her \noverall financial responsibility, and her ability, intent, and desire to meet her financial \nobligations in the future. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:   \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Since December 2003, she has worked for a defense contractor. (Item 3.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) was indebted to a bank on a judgment for $10,380 entered in 2019 (SOR \u00b61 1.a); (2) was indebted on an account delinquent in the amount of $38,282 (SOR \u00b6 b.); and (3) failed to file and pay, as required, federal and state income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2011 to 2018. (SOR \u00b61.c.) (Item 1.) Applicant admitted those allegations, but claimed that the bank judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) had been paid off. (Item 2.) She did not provide documents that the bank judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) had been paid off. The record shows that the judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and SOR \u00b6 1.b. are still delinquent. The date of the last activity (DLA) for SOR \u00b6 1.b. was April 2018. (Items 5 and 6.)

The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

The SOR and the Answer are the pleadings in the case. (Items 1 and 2.) Items \n3 through 6 are admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on August 4, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 51 years old, never married, and has no children. Since December \n2003, she has worked for a defense contractor. (Item 3.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) was indebted to a bank on \na judgment for $10,380 entered in 2019 (SOR \u00b61 1.a); (2) was indebted on an account \ndelinquent in the amount of $38,282 (SOR \u00b6 b.); and (3) failed to file and pay, as required, \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2011 to 2018. (SOR \u00b61.c.) (Item \n1.) Applicant admitted those allegations, but claimed that the bank judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \nhad been paid off. (Item 2.) She did not provide documents that the bank judgment (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a.) had been paid off. The record shows that the judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. are still delinquent. The date of the last activity (DLA) for SOR \u00b6 1.b. was April 2018. \n(Items 5 and 6.) Those two debts are for credit cards Applicant used to pay her bills during \nher medical leaves and subsequent leaves. She just got too far behind. Applicant made \nno contacts with those two creditors to resolve those debts. (Item 4.) \nIn her June 18, 2019 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), Applicant addressed her \nfinancial problems. In 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2014, she had spinal surgeries that \nnecessitated bed rest and being on disability for long periods. In addition, in about 2014, \nApplicant\u2019s father was convicted of possession of child pornography and sentenced to 25 \nmonths in prison. He was released in July 2016. Applicant said that her medical problems \nand her father\u2019s incarceration \u201cweighed on her decision not to take care of her taxes in a \ntimely manner.\u201d (Item 4.) \nIn about 2015 or 2016, DOD contacted Applicant about her tax status. DOD \nwanted her to provide proof that her tax issues had been satisfied. Applicant never \nresponded, because she had no proof she had taken care of her tax issues. She believes \nher failure to respond to DOD caused her clearance to be revoked in July 2016. Even \nafter her clearance was revoked, Applicant did not contact the IRS because she was \n\u201cnervous.\u201d Applicant still works for the same employer, but she is only able to work on \nunclassified projects.

Applicant, her friend, and her friend\u2019s husband prepared federal and state \ntax returns for TY 2010 to TY 2018. Applicant\u2019s tabulation showed that over those nine \nyears, she owed the state a net of $949 and owed the IRS a net of $871. The record, \nhowever, does not indicate if those amounts include interest and penalties that IRS may \nimpose. Applicant planned to mail each return to the taxing authorities with a check for \nany amounts due. She did not provide documents evidencing the filing of those returns \nor the payment of any taxes due. (Item 4.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \nA2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe followings conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f)  failure to file . . . annual Federal, state or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR tax debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the consumer \ndebts by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s credit report. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), \nand (f) apply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . unexpected medical emergency . . .), and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances); and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems with her two consumer debts did not occur that \nlong ago. The judgment was entered in 2019, and the second consumer debt has a DLA \nof April 2018. Although there are only two delinquent consumer debts, the record shows \nno efforts by Applicant to address those debts. Applicant\u2019s many years of failures to file \ntax returns and to pay income taxes are circumstances that cast doubt on her current \nfinancial reliability. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1 b., and 1.c. are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nApplicant suffered back surgeries in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2014. In addition, \nApplicant \u2018s father was incarcerated from 2014 to 2016. She said those events weighed \nadversely on her financial judgment. Such conditions were \u201clargely beyond\u201d Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol, as contemplated by AG \u00b6 20(b). But that mitigating condition also requires an \napplicant to act responsibly under the adverse circumstances she confronted. Here, \nApplicant simply ignored those two debts. That is not responsible conduct. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nand 1. b. are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies suffer for the same reasons discussed above \nabout the application of AG \u00b6 20(b). Her family and medical challenges were no doubt \n\u201clargely beyond\u201d her control. But Applicant similarly ignored her tax failures, even after \nDOD asked her for written proof that she had resolved her tax issues. Instead, she \nengaged in self-help. On this record, there is no evidence that Applicant actually filed \nlate tax returns or paid any taxes due. At best, she was in the process of filing late \nreturns and paying overdue taxes. That is not responsible conduct. SOR \u00b6 1.c. is not \nmitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) or (g). \nWhole Person Concept \n Under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person \nconcept in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \nApplicant leaves me with questions about her eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \n    AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a.,b., c.:  \n                            Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Five SOR debts are paid, and seven SOR debts are in \nestablished payment plans. His overall financial records establish his financial \nresponsibility. Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are mitigated. \nAccess to classified information is granted. \nHistory of the Case \nOn November 18, 2019, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application \n(SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 14, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence \nand Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued an SOR to \nApplicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry, February 20, 1960; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, \n1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) On \nSeptember 15, 2021, Applicant provided a response to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On November 18, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. \nOn February 18, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On March 7, 2022, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for May 17, 2022. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered 5 exhibits into evidence, and Applicant offered 18 \nexhibits into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 16-29; GE 1-GE 5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE \nQ) There were no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence.

(AE Q)  \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant was unemployed from 2013 to 2015 while attending college. (GE 1; SOR \nresponse) From 2016-2018, Applicant and his spouse accrued credit card debt when they \nwere both employed. (Tr. 53) They used credit cards to support themselves and spent \nmore than they should have on eating at restaurants and other activities. (Tr. 42) His \nvehicle\u2019s transmission failed, and he needed to purchase a new vehicle. (Tr. 43) He had \nexpensive dental bills.

(GE 1) Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling $39,266, \nof the following amounts: $10,211; $5,223; $4,861; $4,353; $3,465; $2,819; $2,631; \n$2,307; $1,354; $987; $579; and $476. The first 11 debts are charged-off credit cards or \nloans from lending institutions, and the last debt is a collections account owed to a \ntelecommunications company. \nApplicant entered into a contract with DRC in January 2019. (Tr. 57; SOR\nresponse; AE A) Before January 2019, Applicant was making the minimum payments on \nhis credit cards, and DRC advised him to stop making payments. (Tr. 45, 55-56) In March \n2019, Applicant began paying DRC $500 monthly. DRC contacted the creditors and \nestablished or attempted to establish payment plans with the creditors. (Tr. 45; AE A; AE \nR) At the time of the hearing, Applicant was paying $580 monthly to DRC. (Tr. 45) \nApplicant paid off his spouse\u2019s vehicle in April 2022, and he intends to increase his \nmonthly payment to DRC to complete the payment plan sooner than the scheduled \ncompletion date in about two years. (Tr. 45, 47-48) He received credit counseling from \nDRC. (Tr. 44, 59-60) His budget indicates he has net annual income of about $57,000. \n(Tr. 60-61; AE R) He is making the following monthly payments: purchasing company \nstock for $350; putting $350 into a 401k account; and saving $140. (AE R) The 401k \ncontribution of $350 includes a portion from his employer, and the stock purchase is at a \ndiscounted price. (Tr. 58) Applicant and his family live with his spouse\u2019s grandmother in \nher house. (Tr. 48) He pays $500 monthly for rent. (Tr. 48) He intends to purchase the \nhouse once their other debts are paid. (Tr. 48) \n \nDRC paid the settlement amounts for three SOR debts, and they are resolved: \u00b6 \n1.b (balance at settlement: $5,605; settled for $2,803); \u00b6 1.h (balance at settlement: \n$2,307; settled for $923); and \u00b6 1.l (balance at settlement: $1,060; settled for $583).

(Tr. 49, 70) \nHe received a pay raise in the last 12 months, and he increased his monthly payment to \nDRC to $580. (Tr. 63) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is. well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant experienced unemployment while in college; his spouse was \nunemployed after their child was born; they needed to replace their vehicle; and Applicant \nhad dental expenses. These are circumstances largely beyond his control, which \nadversely affected his finances. However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially \narose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge \ncould still consider whether applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when \ndealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. \n99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, \n1999)). \nAnother component is whether Applicant maintained contact with creditors and \nattempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. He did not prove that he \nmaintained contact with several of his creditors or that he made offers to make partial \npayments to them before engaging DRC to handle his delinquent debts. \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling $39,266. One debt was in a \ncollections status, and the other 11 debts were charged off. In January 2019, Applicant \nengaged DRC to resolve his debts. In April 2019, Applicant began paying DRC $500 \nmonthly in accordance with his DRC contract. DRC paid three SOR debts; Applicant \nseparately paid two SOR debts; and the remaining seven SOR debts are in established \npayment plans. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \nISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (internal citation and footnote \nomitted) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) though 20(d) apply. Based on Applicant\u2019s credible and sincere \npromise to timely pay his debts, future new delinquent debt \u201cis unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on [Applicant\u2019s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and \n\u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d His \npayments to DRC and his history of paying his student loans showed good faith. He \ngenerated a budget and received financial counseling. He has sufficient income to keep \nhis debts in current status and to continue making progress paying DRC until all of the \nSOR debts are paid. He has a good financial plan for the future, and he has shown since \nMarch 2019 that he has the self-discipline to accomplish his financial goals. His efforts \nare sufficient to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old test engineer, and he has worked for his current \nemployer since December 2019. In 2015, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial \nand systems engineering. He successfully completed courses at several universities. His \nresume provides additional details about his professional accomplishments. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSeveral circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances. He was \nsomewhat irresponsible in the handling of his finances when he accrued more credit card \ndebt than was necessary. The SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling $39,266. Five of \nthe debts were settled and the other seven debts are in established payment plans. He \nis on schedule to pay the remaining $12,419 in about two years. He plans to increase his \nmonthly payments to resolve the DRC plan sooner than scheduled. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). \nApplicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his financial \nresponsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d \nof debt re-payment. Applicant was forthright, candid, sincere, and credible in his \npresentation at his hearing. I am confident he will maintain his financial responsibility. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)).  \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

He was married in 2008, and divorced in 2011. He married his second wife in 2011, and they are in the process of getting a divorce. Since 2017, he has worked as a field technician for a government contractor. He reported on his SCA that he has been steadily employed since 2005, except for one period of unemployment from March to September 2012. (TR. 10, 38; GE 1, 2). Applicant stated that he is the only income earner in his family, and that his wife has not consistently worked since they were married. She was not working at the start of their marriage, and since has only held jobs on a short-term basis. He claims that his wife\u2019s inconsistent employment history is the reason for his financial problems. He asserted that his debts can be easily managed and solved once his divorce is finalized. He reported that his wife has experienced health problems since they were married, which has resulted in hospital visits and medical bills for her care.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports, bankruptcy records, and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should \napply. He did not provide sufficient documentation showing that any of the SOR debts \nhave been paid, or otherwise resolved. His Chapter 7 bankruptcy was only eight years \nago, and he is in financial distress again, so it cannot be found that his financial problems \nare unlikely to recur. The record shows that at this time he is not willing or able to address \nhis debts responsibly. His debts are recent, not isolated, and ongoing. This continues to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant is given some consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b). His wife\u2019s medical \nexpenses had an impact on his finances. However, the record shows that all of the SOR \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts are unresolved, and he did not provide sufficient evidence showing that he \nundertook responsible action to address them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) potentially applies SOR \u00b6 1.g, because Applicant claims that this debt \nwas satisfied by his gap insurance. However, Applicant did not provide documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute, or sufficient evidence of actions he took to resolve \nthe issue, so AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant has not resolved \nany of the SOR debts, and did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising out his Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and his nine unresolved charged-off and \ndelinquent debts under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Later in the SCA, he \ndenied using marijuana while holding a security clearance (even though he completed \nhis 2018 SCA stating that he held a security clearance since 2012). He also stated in \nhis SCA that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because he has nothing to \ngain by using it and he did not get much pleasure out of using it. In June 2019, during \nhis background interview, Applicant described the three times he used marijuana before \ncompleting his 2018 SCA. He then admitted using marijuana three to four more times \nafter completing his 2018 SCA. He told the investigator he was not sure if he possessed \na security clearance during his most recent uses of marijuana.

He also told the investigator that he did not intend \nto use marijuana in the future. (Items 3-4) \nIn his SOR answer, he admitted using marijuana while possessing a security \nclearance, but he claimed that at the time of the uses he did not have access to \nclassified information or facilities.

I find that both of the above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was not frequent, six uses from 2017 to 2019, but it \nwas recent. It is troubling that Applicant broke the commitment he made in his 2018 \nSCA not to use marijuana in the future by using marijuana multiple times in 2019. He \nalso failed to provide a signed statement of his intent not to use marijuana in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s short abstention is insufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. \nAdditionally, his use of marijuana while holding a security clearance casts doubt upon \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that he used marijuana \nas recently as May 2019, while holding a security clearance and having just recently \ncompleted an SCA. I also considered the circumstances he described surrounding his \nuses and his stated intent not to use marijuana in the future. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

(Items 2, 4, 5) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed two delinquent student loans totaling about \n$81,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). The SOR also alleged that Applicant\u2019s wages were \ngarnished at Employer A in about October 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Despite listing these issues \non the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) she submitted in January \n2020, and discussing them during her February 2020 security interview, she denied both \nSOR debts in the Answer, claiming that her student loans are not delinquent or in \ncollections. She also denied that her wages were garnished in October 2019 or at any \ntime since then. (Items 2, 4-8) \nThe delinquent federal student loans totaling about $81,000 listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b have not been resolved. Applicant began experiencing problems paying these \nloans in about 2010 because she did not have steady employment. From 2010 until 2019, \nshe made occasional, irregular payments to the collection agencies that serviced her \nloans after she defaulted on them. She entered into a rehabilitation program at some point \nbetween 2017 and 2019, but stopped making payments pursuant to this rehabilitation \nprogram in about July 2019. She provided documentary evidence that she entered into \nanother rehabilitation agreement with the servicer of her student loans in January 2021. \nThis date is over a year after she began her most recent employment, and about a year \nafter she submitted her SF 86 and had her security interview. \nPursuant to this 2021 rehabilitation agreement, Applicant was required to make \nnine monthly payments of $571. She did not make any payments pursuant to this \nrehabilitation agreement as she subsequently learned that her loans had been deferred \nin March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. She provided documentary \nevidence that, in May 2022, these loans were listed as being current on a credit report, in \nforbearance until August 31, 2022, and no payment was due until August 31, 2022, at the \nearliest. The reason for this status is the deferment period on student loan payments as \na result of the COVID-19 pandemic; not because Applicant made payments on the loans. \n(Items 2, 4-8) \nOnce this deferment period ends, Applicant\u2019s monthly payment on these loans will \nbe about $571. She claimed that she will have sufficient funds to make her student loan \npayment when it becomes due, and provided an April to May 2022, bank account \nstatement showing a balance of about $800 to support her position. These student loans \nare listed on her 2020, 2021, and 2022 credit reports. The 2021 and 2022 credit report \nshow a last payment date of March 2020 and May 2022, respectively.

(Items 2, 4-8) \nIn October 2019, after receiving a letter from the Department of Education, \nApplicant learned that 15 percent of her wages would be garnished in order to satisfy her \naforementioned student loans. She provided a letter from Employer B, for whom she \nbegan working in December 2019, stating that Employer B had never been served with a \ngarnishment order with respect to Applicant. Her employment with Employer B began two \nmonths after she was put on notice by the Department of Education about a potential \ngarnishment. While there is evidence in the record that the Department of Education \nthreatened a wage garnishment, there is no evidence in the record that Applicant\u2019s wages \nwith Employer A were actually garnished. (Items 2, 4-5) \nApplicant provided a character reference letter from her employer\u2019s security officer \nstating that she is dedicated, diligent, shows leadership skills, and has been a valuable \nasset at work. Her security officer also stated that she properly handled company \ntransactions and has been entrusted with training new employees. Applicant claimed that \nnow that she has her current job, she has enough money to meet her financial obligations \nand pay her student loans when the deferral period ends. She provided documents \nshowing payments on her and her spouse\u2019s other loans and expenses, as well as a credit \nreport, to show that she was current on other financial obligations. She provided no \nevidence that she sought or plans to seek financial counseling. She did not respond to \nthe FORM, so more recent information about her finances is not available. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans totaling about $81,000 were in default for almost a \ndecade. She made inconsistent payments on them during that time. While the student \nloans are no longer considered delinquent because of the COVID-19 deferment, that \naction does not excuse previously delinquent student loans such as these. See ISCR \nCase No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). The above listed conditions are made \napplicable by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b., thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide \nevidence in mitigation. \nThe garnishment listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c pertains to the collection of the student loans \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Therefore, the security concerns it poses are largely \nredundant to those presented by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Additionally, as the evidence only \nestablished the threat of a garnishment, and not an actual garnishment with Employer A, \nthe SOR allegation, as written, is not established. While I note the security concern \npresented by a delinquent federal debt that necessitates involuntary collection, because \nof the duplicative nature of the allegation and the lack of evidence supporting it, I find in \nApplicant\u2019s favor with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nFrom 2010 until 2021, Applicant only sporadically addressed her federal student \nloans. They were in default for about a decade. A security clearance represents an \nobligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, \nfailure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-\n03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). While these debts are in a deferment status because \nof the pandemic, Applicant defaulted on them prior to the deferment. When student loans \nare placed in a deferment status after they are in default, Applicant\u2019s past inactions are \nnot excused in the context of security clearance eligibility. Given the length of time that \nthese loans were in default, coupled with the automatic nature of the deferment without \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmeaningful resolution, I cannot find that her unwillingness or inability to address these \nloans was infrequent or is unlikely to recur. \nWhile Applicant claims that her failure to address these loans was caused by \nunemployment, she must also show that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nShe failed to make this showing. Despite beginning a new job in December 2019, that \nshe alleged would allow her to pay her student loans, she made no payments since then. \nAs evidenced by the timing of her January 2021 rehabilitation agreement and when her \nstudent loans changed to a deferment status, she made no meaningful effort to resolve \nher student loans until after she submitted her SF 86 and had her security interview. An \napplicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice \nthat his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow \nrules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). As such, the timing and nature \nof her efforts to address these debts undermines her ability to show that she acted in \ngood faith or responsibly under the circumstances. None of the mitigating conditions \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I also considered Applicant\u2019s positive character reference. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She said she was hiding in a refugee camp \nunder the local ministries protection. She had a lawyer who was helping her with her \nrefugee status, but needed money so she could leave the country (Togo). Applicant \nagreed to help her and took out two loans. He told the investigator that he sent her money \nvia MoneyGrams. He said that he never sent less than $300 or more than $5,000 in one \ntransaction. All of the money was sent to her lawyer in Togo. He sent money until he was \nno longer able to do so and told her she would have to find another way. After that, \nApplicant did not hear from Ms. M for several months. When she did contact him, she \nsaid she had moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, with a man she did not want to be \nwith, and her online access was being restricted. Applicant said he had not had further \ncontact with her since that last email. (Tr. 105-120; GE 2 \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in November 2020. In them, he \nstated that after checking his email, he confirmed his last contact with Ms. M was in March \n2017. He said she was a refugee, but did not know her country of citizenship. He stated \nthat between 2015 and 2017, he provided her money to help her. During his hearing, he \nstated he could not recall how many times he sent Ms. M money. He said the largest \namount he sent her was a couple of hundred dollars, but also confirmed he took two loans \nout for $3,000 and $1,500 and sent all of this money to her. He confirmed the approximate \ntotal he sent to her was $7,000 and when he could not afford to send anymore, she \nceased contact. He testified that he became a \u201clittle suspicious\u201d after she moved to Dubai, \nbut he believed that she had been a target so she had to maintain a low profile so she \nwould not get killed. He initially stated that he expected to receive $500,000 from her as \na reward for helping, later he contradicted himself, saying he did not expect to receive the \nreward from her. He testified this scenario made him more skeptical and aware that he \nhad to confirm information about someone who contacted him in the future. He no longer \nbelieves her story. Applicant provided contradictory testimony and was not credible. (Tr. \n31-38, 105-120; GE 2) \nIn early 2018, Applicant received another unsolicited email from a woman, Ms. H. \nHe describes her as his girlfriend. She sent him nude photos numerous times. He sent \nher nude photos about six times. He also sent her videos of him nude and performing \nsexual acts. He said he sent between 10 and 20 videos. She did not send him videos. \nThey have never met in person. Applicant was not concerned about sending this type of \ncontent to her then or now. (Tr. 38-42, 121-128) \nMs. H told Applicant that she needed to send him money because she was having \ndifficulty getting her inheritance. She said she would send him money from her clients\nand asked him to open bank accounts, deposit the money, and then he should send\nmoney orders to two people he did not know. When asked if he thought Ms. H was using \nhim for money laundering, he wavered back and forth in his response.

At the time he completed his interrogatories \nin November 2020, he was still sending her funds to cover her living expenses. He sent \nthis money by Bitcoin. When asked when was the last time he sent money to Ms. H, he \nsaid he sent her $1,500 the preceding week, on January 5, 2022, days before his hearing. \nHis last contact was on January 7, 2022. This money was in addition to the previous \n$2,000 he sent to her. He said he sent her money to help her with immigration issues. He \nwas not initially suspicious of her activity and believed her requests were legitimate. \nHowever, after his repeated requests to her to provide him with documents and her failure \nto do so, he now believes her actions were not legitimate. He said he has now cut off \ncommunication with her, by deleting her account. (Tr. 39-40, 46-56, 129) \nApplicant testified that when Ms. H first contacted him, she lived in a neighboring \nstate, but they did not visit each other because he did not have the time to take off from \nwork, or the money to travel, and his vehicle was unreliable. The money he sent went to \nher lawyer, who is in Nigeria. When asked if he was aware that MoneyGram and Western \nUnion likely blocked his transactions because they suspected fraud, he said he \nunderstood, but he had the names of the people he was to send money to and believed \nthem to be legitimate at the time. He took precautions and requested Ms. H provide him \na copy of her passport, which she did, so he believed she was real. He also requested \nthey have a video chat. They had one, and he was able to verify the photo on the passport \nwas the same person in the video chat. He said Ms. H is now living in Nigeria and she \ntold Applicant that she acquired a new passport because her original one was confiscated \nby the hotel where she was living. Applicant provided maps of the location of the hotel. \n(Tr. 41-56, 144-148; GE 2) \nApplicant provided a copy of the passport Ms. H gave him. He wanted her to \nprovide him a copy to prove she was who she claimed. A review of the passport clearly \nshows it is fraudulent. The name at the top of the passport is different than the name at \nthe bottom. It also has two different passport numbers. Its expiration date does not reflect \nthe correct ten-year period. Most glaring is that the \u201cUnited States of America\u201d is spelled \nwrong (State is used vice States). Applicant did not seem to understand that the scenarios \nhe participated in with Ms. M and Ms. H were scams. He did not believe he had been \nmanipulated. He testified that in the future he will be more skeptical, and he no longer will \naccept unsolicited emails. He did not believe he could be exploited in the future because \nhe is concerned about the criminal consequences. (Tr. 56-57, 68-69, 148-153; GE 2; \nAnswer to SOR) \nIn February 2020, at the request of the Government, Applicant participated in a \npsychological evaluation. During the interview process, Applicant related the information \nnoted above about Ms. M and Ms. H to the licensed psychologist. The psychologist noted \nthat when she asked Applicant whether his association with unknown individuals in \nforeign countries who have asked for financial support could be problematic or a security \nrisk, he stated \u201cno.\u201d The psychologist opined: \u201cHe did not demonstrate any real insight or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecognition that these random contacts could compromise the safety and security of him \npersonally and also his work and more global security issues.\u201d (GE 4, 6) \nDuring the interview with the psychologist, Applicant described an incident where \nhe inappropriately obtained derogatory information about a supervisor, confronted her \nwith the information, and shared it with a colleague. He did not think any of his actions \nwere questionable or that his judgment and decision-making were potentially flawed. \nWhen asked at his hearing about this incident, he explained that he learned that his \nsupervisor had been charged with a misdemeanor as a juvenile. He retrieved the \ndocuments from a copy machine, viewed them, and shared them. Applicant justified his \nconduct stating that he expected his supervisor to be \u201cclear of everything.\u201d (Tr. 161) He \nsaid he did it because he has high expectations and standards for his supervisor. He \nadmitted he did not have the authority to view the documents or to disclose the information \nto anyone, which he did. He did it because he wanted to know what his supervisor had \ndone. He had concerns about her being selected to supervise the team. (Tr. 58-67, 154-\n166; GE 4) \nApplicant also told the psychologist that if Ms. H had a driver\u2019s license he would \naccess his state\u2019s database for his personal use to check her status. Through his job, \nApplicant has access to the state\u2019s database for driver\u2019s licenses, but he is not authorized \nto use it for personal use. (Tr. 166-168; GE 4) \nThe psychologist noted that Applicant stated that he was likely taken advantage of \nby Ms. M, but did check that the photo she sent him had not been altered so he could see \nit was legitimate. This made him more skeptical when he was dealing with Ms. H. The \npsychologist noted that Applicant did not see the similarities between the two incidents. \nHe saw the incident with Ms. M as an isolated occurrence and the one with Ms. H as \ndifferent. The psychologist is concerned \u201cabout a pattern of behavior involving poor \njudgment and decision-making and equally if not more concerning is his apparent social \nnaivet\u00e9 and lack of insight. His perceptions of reality appear rather skewed.\u201d (GE 4) \nApplicant testified he does not believe he was manipulated or that he could be \nexploited. He said he stopped his contact with Ms. M because he questioned her identity, \nwhich is inconsistent with other testimony he provided. Regarding Ms. H he said that he \ngathered evidence about her and because he could not determine her location, he \nstopped all communication. It was during cross-examination that it was learned his last \ncontact was three days before his hearing. Applicant repeatedly contradicted himself and \nhis prior statements. In addition, he repeatedly minimized, justified, and rationalized his \nconduct. I did not find his testimony credible. (Tr. 144-172) \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of China and a permanent resident of the United \nStates. She immigrated in 1999 and is 73 years old. She worked in the United States and \nis retired. He visits his mother about once or twice in a three-month period and talks to \nher every other week by phone.

Applicant\u2019s parents reside together in the U.S. \nBoth are aware that Applicant has applied for a security clearance. Tr. 24-29, 79-88; AE \nA, C) \nApplicant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law are residents and citizens of China. They have \none child. His brother chose to remain in China when his parents and Applicant \nimmigrated. His brother is a technical officer for the Chinese government. He is an \nengineer and does safely inspections on buildings. Applicant\u2019s brother came to the U.S. \nfor a visit in 2003. Prior to then Applicant visited him in China in 2000 or 2001. Applicant \ndoes not know his sister-in-law\u2019s occupation or where she works. He has telephone \ncontact with his brother about every six months. Throughout Applicant\u2019s testimony, I had \nconcerns and doubts about his veracity and candor. (Tr. 91-96) \nApplicant provided a certificate of recognition for his ten years of service to his \nstate and a copy of his resume. (AE C, D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, considerations of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to \ninclude breach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government protected \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ninformation; (2) any disruptive, violent, or inappropriate behavior; and (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; . . .; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant was disciplined under Article 15 of the UCMJ while in the military for \nsexual harassment and violation of the fraternization policy. He was reduced in rank. He \nwas discharged for unsatisfactory performance. \nApplicant established relationships through unsolicited emails with two different \nwomen. He never met either. His contact with Ms. M began either in 2013 or 2015. She \nclaimed she was in danger and over the course of at least two years, he sent her \napproximately $7,000. When he could no longer afford to send her money, their contact \nceased. He believed the woman\u2019s story because she sent him a photo. \nApplicant testified the second woman is his girlfriend. They have exchanged nude \nphotos and he has sent her numerous videos of himself performing sexual acts. He \nagreed to accept money from her, deposit it in his bank accounts, then transfer it back to \nher or others by money order. He does not believe this was likely money laundering. He \nsent her his own money too. He believes her story and believes he has corroborated it \nwith what is clearly a fraudulent passport. Applicant transferred money even after his \ntransactions were blocked by money transfer services and he was warned of potential \nfraud. His contact with Ms. H began in 2018, and Applicant most recently sent her money \nfive days before his hearing and had contact with her three days before his hearing. \nDuring a psychological evaluation, Applicant disclosed an episode where he \ninappropriately obtained derogatory information about his supervisor, confronted her with \nit, and shared it with a colleague. He also told the psychologist during his evaluation that \nhe has access to his employer\u2019s database and expressed a willingness to access it for \npersonal use. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules or regulations.  \nApplicant does not grasp the gravity of his conduct. Through unsolicited emails, he \nestablished relationships with two women who told him obvious scam stories. He sent\nthem money. He unwittingly participated in what is likely a money laundering scheme, but\nhe still does not believe it despite transfer services blocking his account due to potential\nfraud, and continues to have contact with this woman, even after being provided with an\nobvious fraudulent passport. He does not recognize how he could be exploited by sending\nnude photos and sexually explicit videos of himself. He believes his conduct of\ninappropriately obtaining derogatory information about his supervisor, confronting her,\nand sharing it with a colleague, was justified because of his high expectations for his\nsupervisor. His willingness to access his employer\u2019s database for his personal use is a\nconcern.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is not minor or infrequent. He says he stopped communicating \nwith Ms. H as of his last email on January 7, 2022. It is obvious she was exploiting him. \nAlthough his initial association with Ms. H may have been unwitting, he continued to \nmaintain contact with her. Applicant did not provide evidence that he has obtained \ncounseling or changed his behavior or that future inappropriate behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt on his reliability, judgment, and willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business,\nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result\nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they\ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and\ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nThere are significant espionage concerns and ongoing human rights problems in \nChina. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, through his \nmother, who is a citizen of China and travels there to visit her family, and his brother who \nworks for the Chinese government. Applicant\u2019s personal conduct as addressed above \nalso raises a concern of exploitation. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised \nby the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersonal are located, or the positions or activities of those person in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, and the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. Applicant\u2019s mother, brother, and sister-in-law have \nties to China. His brother works for the Chinese government. Applicant maintains contact \nwith them. Applicant engages in questionable conduct which creates an increased risk of \nvulnerability, manipulation and exploitation by China, a country that actively engages in \nespionage and exploits Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China to gain \ninsider access to sensitive and classified information. None of the mitigating conditions \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and E, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 44 years old with a significant history of engaging in questionable \nconduct. He failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nserious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline E, personal conduct and Guideline B, foreign influence. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   2.f:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that, as of September 21, 2021, Applicant owed student-loan debts in collection for $25,616 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $9,143 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) debt of $379 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a satellite-television service debt of $32 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a cellular-phone debt of $282 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and four medical debts of $151 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $165 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), $774 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and $262 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) in collection. (Item 1.) When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, but then disputed the validity of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and the accuracy of the amount in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He did not respond to SOR \u00b6 1.i, which may have been missed as it was alleged out of alphabetical order. He explained he had no success in getting his health insurer to cover the medical debts that were incurred when he was shot during an armed robbery, and he had mistakenly thought that his student loans were deferred when he began graduate school classes online. (Item 2.) After considering Items 1 through 7, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 39 years old. He and his ex-wife divorced in February 2014 after eight years of marriage. Their two children, a daughter age 14 and son age 12, live with his ex- wife. As of October 2017, Applicant had been in a cohabitant relationship since June 2013. (Item 3.)

On November 18, 2021, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of a statement of the \nGovernment\u2019s position and seven documents pre-marked as Item 1 through Item 7. The \nSOR and Applicant\u2019s SOR response were included as Items 1 and 2, respectively. On \nNovember 18, 2021, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him \nthat any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on \nNovember 22, 2021. The December 22, 2021 deadline for Applicant\u2019s response passed \nwithout any documents having been received from him in response to the FORM. \nOn February 2, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on February 11, 2022. Items 1 \nthrough 7 were accepted as evidentiary exhibits subject to issues of relevance and \nmateriality in light of the entire record. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that, as of September 21, 2021, Applicant owed student-loan \ndebts in collection for $25,616 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $9,143 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) debt of $379 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a satellite-television service \ndebt of $32 in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a cellular-phone debt of $282 in collection (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f); and four medical debts of $151 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $165 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), $774 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and \n$262 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) in collection. (Item 1.) When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, but then disputed the validity of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nand the accuracy of the amount in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He did not respond to SOR \u00b6 1.i, which may \nhave been missed as it was alleged out of alphabetical order. He explained he had no \nsuccess in getting his health insurer to cover the medical debts that were incurred when he \nwas shot during an armed robbery, and he had mistakenly thought that his student loans \nwere deferred when he began graduate school classes online. (Item 2.) After considering \nItems 1 through 7, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 39 years old. He and his ex-wife divorced in February 2014 after eight \nyears of marriage. Their two children, a daughter age 14 and son age 12, live with his ex-\nwife. As of October 2017, Applicant had been in a cohabitant relationship since June 2013. \n(Item 3.) \nApplicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree earned in May 2007. He was enrolled in a \nuniversity for one semester before pursuing a graduate degree online in 2019. It is not \nclear in the record how long he pursued his studies online. He was not pursuing any \nstudies in October 2021, although he planned on resuming his graduate studies online in \nJanuary 2022. (Items 2, 3.)

(Item 3.) \nApplicant served honorably in the Army National Guard (ARNG) from November \n2004 to October 2013. He was granted a Secret clearance in approximately October 2005. \nHe was in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) in college, and was commissioned \nas an officer on his college graduation. (Item 3.) In February 2010, at the rank of captain, \nhe was activated for a full-time position as a program manager with the ARNG. He \nremained on active duty orders for an overseas deployment from August 2012 to June \n2013. On his return, he worked from home full time doing manpower studies and analysis \nfor a data solutions company on a government contract. He lost that job in September \n2015 when the contract was not renewed. He was unemployed until November 2015. He \nhad some temporary work from November 2015 until July 2016, when that work was \noutsourced overseas. It appears that he had two sources of income from February 2016, \nwhen he first started with his current employer, until July 2016, when he lost both jobs. \n(Item 3.) \nOn October 30, 2017, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) for his current employer. In response to an SF 86 inquiry concerning any \ndelinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed four debts: an $800 credit-card \ndebt that he resolved in September 2016; medical bills totaling $9,000 incurred because he \nwas shot while being robbed in April 2015; a disputed $282 cellular-phone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \nin collection that he claimed was resolved in May 2015 when he closed his account; and \nstudent loans totaling $28,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). He explained that he would be re-\nenrolling in school that next semester and planned \u201cto request deferment while in school.\u201d \n(Item 3.) \nOne or more of Applicant\u2019s credit reports from November 18, 2017 (Item 7), May \n16, 2019 (Item 6), and March 23, 2020 (Item 5) showed that Applicant defaulted on the \nfollowing accounts. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2014 $25,616 \nIn August 2001, Applicant obtained a student loan for $18,585. In April 2010, the \nloan had a balance of $26,596. The loan was rated as current until April 2017. As of \nOctober 2017, the loan account was 180 days past due for $2,233 with a total balance of \n$29,007. (Items 6-7.) As of April 2019, the loan was in collections for $25,313. (Item 6.) \nThe loan reportedly had a delinquent balance of $25,616 as of February 2020. (Item 5.) \nApplicant explained during an August 9, 2018 personnel subject interview (PSI) with \nan authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that he had to \ncontinue to apply for hardship deferments of his student loans. He explained that he initially \nneglected his student loans due to lack of income. He indicated that his medical bills \nbecame his focus after he was injured while being robbed in April 2015. He admitted that \nhe received a letter from a collections entity about the student-loan debts in approximately \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2017. He asserted that he had recently set up an online account with the Department of \nEducation to establish a repayment plan, and he was hoping to pay about $100 to $200 a \nmonth toward his student loans. Applicant stated that since medical bills were no longer a \nconcern, he could focus on his student loans to bring them current. Applicant estimated \nthat he owed about $42,000 in total student-loan debts. (Item 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2014 $9,143 \nIn September 2006, Applicant obtained a student loan for $7,339. The loan was \ndeferred for a time. As of October 2017, Applicant was $1,114 past due on a student loan \nwith a $12,447 balance. (Item 7.) As of February 2020, Applicant reportedly owed a \ndelinquent student-loan balance of $9,143. (Item 5.) \nWith respect to the student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Applicant stated in \nresponse to the SOR in October 2021 that he had been making monthly payments of $100 \nin 2019 until he began graduate school online and assumed he did not have to make \npayments on the loans. He apparently suspended his studies for a time, as he stated that \nhe would be re-enrolling at the university starting in January 2022 and would \u201cwork to get \nthis fixed.\u201d (Item 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2014 $379 \nIn September 2019, the VA placed a $379 debt for collection. As of February 2020, \nthe debt was unpaid. (Item 5.) Applicant explained in response to the SOR that he had \ndropped an online class in graduate school when his father was placed in hospice care, \nalthough he did not specify when that occurred. Applicant took off a semester and then re-\nenrolled in graduate school. He mistakenly thought that the VA had withdrawn the funds for \nthe debt from his GI benefits. He admitted his error and indicated that he could work with \nthe VA to resolve the debt. (Item 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2014 $151 \nIn November 2018, a $151 medical debt was placed for collection. As of March \n2020, the debt had not been paid. (Item 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2014 $32 \nIn July 2017, a satellite-television company placed a $31 debt for collection. As of \nNovember 2017, the collection entity was reporting a $32 balance. (Item 7.) During his \nAugust 2018 PSI, Applicant stated that he had satellite-television service in 2014, but he \ncancelled the account when he moved. He asserted that he was never notified of an \nunpaid balance on the account. He indicated that he would inquire about the debt, and \nresolve any valid balance. (Item 4.) In October 2021, Applicant expressed his belief the \ndebt was not valid as he had closed out his account and was unaware of any balance. \n(Item 2.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \u2014 $282 \nIn March 2017, a collection entity acquired a $282 cellular-phone debt. As of \nOctober 2017, the debt was unpaid. (Items 3, 7.) Applicant explained during his August \n2018 PSI that he thought the matter was closed after he told the collection entity that he \nwas not under contract with the cellular-phone company when the debt was reportedly \nincurred. He explained that he would attempt to verify the debt and pay it in full within a \nmonth if it was shown to be valid. (Item 4.) In his October 2021 response to the SOR, \nApplicant indicated that he had closed the account after he returned from his deployment in \n2013 and that he had \u201crequested previously that this [debt] be removed from [his] credit \nreport.\u201d (Item 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g \u2014 $165 \nIn May 2016, a $160 medical debt was placed for collection. As of October 2017, \nthe account had an unpaid balance of $165. (Item 7.) When asked about this debt and the \nmedical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i during his August 2018 PSI, Applicant did not \nrecognize the collection entities, but surmised that the medical debts in collections stem \nfrom his medical care after being victimized in a robbery. (Item 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h \u2014 $774 \nA medical debt was in collection for $774 as of October 2017. (Item 7.) There is no \nevidence that debt has been paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i \u2014 $262 \nIn March 2016, a collection entity acquired a $262 medical debt. As of May 2019, \nthe debt was unpaid. (Items 6-7.) \nApplicant was shot while being robbed in April 2015. Because his wallet was stolen, \nhe did not have his medical insurance card to produce at the hospital, but he was able to \nprovide his medical insurance information. He explained on his October 2017 SF 86 about \nthe listed $9,000 in medical delinquencies, which he subsequently asserted without \ncorroboration includes the medical debts alleged in the SOR, that the creditor hospital \n\u201crefused to look [him] up via [his] SSN and personal info,\u201d and billed him directly for the \nmedical charges. Thinking that his medical insurance would cover them, he ignored the \nmedical bills. In approximately September 2017, the state began garnishing his paycheck \nat $260 per month. He then started working with the state\u2019s crime victims advocate office, \nand reportedly received assurances by the time of his August 2018 PSI that the medical \nbills would be paid and that he would be reimbursed for his wages garnished. (Items 3-4.) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had tried unsuccessfully to resolve the \nmedical debts with his health insurance provider. (Item 2.) \nDuring his August 2018 PSI, Applicant described his financial situation as good.

Applicant expressed his belief that he would be able to rectify his \noutstanding delinquencies, assuming he could repay his student loans monthly in small \nincrements. (Item 4.) \nApplicant presented no documentation of any efforts to pay, settle, otherwise \nresolve, or dispute the debts in the SOR, even though he had an opportunity to update the \nevidentiary record in response to the FORM. He provided no information about his current \nincome or expenses, including about any child support payments to his ex-wife. In addition \nto the delinquent student loans, VA debt, and the $151 medical collection debt, Applicant\u2019s \nMarch 2020 credit report showed that he owed an outstanding credit-card balance of \n$10,783 on an account closed by the credit grantor. The account had been ninety days \ndelinquent from February 2019 to April 2019, although Applicant was making payments on \nthe account. Applicant was current in his payments on a credit-card account with a $2,585 \nbalance. He made timely payments of $296 per month on an unsecured loan for $1,500 \nobtained in September 2018 and satisfied the loan in May 2019. He paid off a $31,041 car \nloan in July 2019. His loan payments had been delinquent 30 days six times. (Item 5.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also  EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. One or more of the credit reports in evidence \nestablishes the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i. Although Applicant believes the \nmedical debts should have been covered by his health insurer, he admits that he had no \nsuccess in having them paid by his health insurer. He provided no documentation showing \nthey have been paid by the crime victims advocate office or of the efforts he took in an \nattempt to address them. Regarding the $32 satellite-television and $282 cellular-phone \ndebts, which he asserts are invalid or inaccurate, he failed to disprove his liability for those \ndebts. The Appeal Board has held that adverse information from a credit report is normally \nsufficient to meet the substantial evidence standard to establish a debt. See ISCR Case \nNo. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015) (citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d primarily applies. \nThe Government\u2019s case for AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of \nthe ability to do so,\u201d is not conclusively established, despite the absence of documentation \nshowing reasonable steps to resolve his delinquent debts. During his August 2018 PSI, \nApplicant expressed his intention to resolve his legitimate debts. With respect to his \nstudent loans, he stated that he had recently established an online account with the \nDepartment of Education to establish a repayment plan. Applicant stated in response to the \nSOR in October 2021 that he had been making monthly payments of $100 in 2019 until he \nbegan graduate school online and assumed he did not have to make payments on the \nloans. He stated that he would be re-enrolling at the university starting in January 2022 and \nwould \u201cwork to get this fixed.\u201d \nApplicant has the burdens of production and persuasion in establishing sufficient \nmitigation to overcome the financial concerns raised by his failure to meet some of his \nfinancial obligations according to contractual terms. AG \u00b6 20 provides for mitigation under \none or more of the following conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide documentation of any payments, settlement \nnegotiations, student-loan deferments, creditor contacts, or other attempts to resolve the \ndelinquent debts of concern to the DOD makes it difficult to apply AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), or \n20(d). An applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and \nare considered recent for mitigating purposes under AG \u00b6 20(a). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. \n3, 2017)). Payments of $100 a month in 2019 toward his student loans could be \nconsidered a good-faith effort under AG \u00b6 20(d) to address his student-loan defaults, but \nthere is no proof of any such payments. His March 2020 credit report shows that his \nstudent loans have been inactive since February 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and January 2017 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). He provided no proof of payments that would disprove the accuracy of that \ncredit information. \nAlthough the disputed cellular-phone and satellite-television debts have been \ndropped from his credit report, Applicant provided no evidence that the debts are not his \nresponsibility. The Appeal Board noted in ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, \n2015) and reiterated in ISCR Case No. 26-01338 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 13, 2018) that the fact \nthat a debt no longer appears on a credit report is not \u201cmeaningful, independent evidence \nas to the disposition of the debt.\u201d The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most \nnegative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency \nor if they become no longer legally collectible because of a state statute of limitations, \nwhichever is longer. See Title 15, U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. Debts may also be dropped from a \ncredit report upon dispute when the creditor believes the debt is not going to be paid or \nwhen the debt has been charged off. \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability, assuming the medical debts alleged in the SOR \nwere incurred because he was the victim of a robbery, which is an unforeseen \ncircumstance contemplated within that mitigating condition. However, AG \u00b6 20(b) requires \nthat the individual act responsibly to address the debts. It is unclear when he contacted his \nhealth insurer about the debts. The medical debts in SOR \u00b6 1.g and 1.i were placed for \ncollection in 2016. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h was in collection as of October 2017. The date of \nlast activity for the $151 medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d is November 2018. An applicant is not \nrequired to establish that he or she has paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first \ndebts paid be those in the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nHowever, \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d \n See, e.g., ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018.) Uncorroborated \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-92160 at 5 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). \nApplicant provided no information about his income or expenses so a reasonable \nassessment cannot be made of when the delinquencies will be resolved. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not adequately mitigated. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nassertions that he would work on fixing the debts are not a substitute for a track record of \npayments. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nApplicant asserts that he did not realize that his student loans were not deferred \nwhen he started graduate school online. He has known since his August 2018 PSI about \nthe debts of concern to the Government. As of October 2021, he was still maintaining that \nhe would work to get his student loans and VA debts fixed. Concerns about his financial \njudgment are not assuaged by his ongoing failure to give sufficient priority to resolving the \nissues of security concern. He provided no evidence of a circumstance that could justify his \nlack of progress toward resolving the debts. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against \nthe grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

His parents-\nin-law divorced, and his mother-in-law passed away when his wife was young. His wife \nwas primarily raised by her grandmother, who comes from a rural area and has no \ndirect connection to the Chinese government or the Communist Party. Her grandmother \nvisited them in the United States in about 2017 and stayed through his wife\u2019s pregnancy \nand the birth of their child in 2018. She visited again for a few months in about 2019. His \nwife\u2019s aunt visited them in the United States twice for a few months each time. His wife\u2019s \ngrandmother and aunt do not speak English, and Applicant does not speak Mandarin, \nso their only real communication was through his wife. (Tr. at 43-48, 99-105, 111; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s wife is not close to her father. She blames him for not helping her \nmother more. Applicant has never met nor spoken to him. Applicant also mentioned that \nhe does not believe his father-in-law approved of the marriage. His father-in-law owns a \nsmall business and has no direct connection to the Chinese government or the \nCommunist Party. Applicant stated that his father-in-law did not have to pay for his \ndaughter\u2019s education in the United States.

Future visitors are less likely because \nChina has made it more difficult for their citizens to travel overseas. (Tr. at 52; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE J, K) \nApplicant has not been to China since he left in 2013. His wife went to China in \nabout 2017 to travel with her grandmother to the United States. Her last trip to China \nwas in 2019 to update her national identification card. China would not renew the \ndocument at their consulates, and required their citizens to return to China to do so. \nApplicant and his wife have decided that unless the political situation changes in China, \nshe will not return. She has applied for U.S. citizenship. (Tr. at 53-54, 57; AE L, M) \nThe PRC is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over \n1.4 billion people. The PRC has an authoritarian government, dominated by the\nChinese Communist Party. The PRC has a poor record with respect to human rights\nand suppresses political dissent. Its practices include official repression of the freedoms\nof speech, religion, movement, association, and assembly; forced confessions; torture;\nmistreatment of prisoners; and arbitrary arrest, detention, and killings.  \n \n \n \n \nThe PRC engages in espionage against the United States and is one of the two \nmost active collectors of U.S. economic intelligence and technology. The PRC also \nsometimes uses coercion or blackmail to manipulate its citizens overseas to conduct \ninfluence operations on behalf of the PRC, such as threatening ethnic Uyghurs living in \nthe United States with imprisonment of their family members in China. Additionally, the \nPRC targets individuals in other countries to support its acquisition of foreign \ntechnology. The PRC\u2019s \u201cThousand Talents Program\u201d seeks to recruit individuals \nprimarily, but not exclusively, from relevant diaspora populations and recent emigrants \nfrom the PRC, as well as foreign national experts whose recruitment the PRC views as \nnecessary to its scientific and technical modernization, especially with regard to defense \ntechnology. \nApplicant does not disagree with the nature of the PRC\u2019s government. He agrees \nthat China is a hostile power and a dangerous country that is becoming more \ndangerous. His position is that the Government\u2019s theory of coercion does not make \nsense; that force of threats against loved ones is too risky for a rational adversary to \nconsider; and that \u201csecrecy creates a shield against coercion.\u201d He did an expansive \nresearch of reported spying and espionage cases and found that coercion against loved \nones is extremely rare. A study concluded that \u201c[p]eople coerced into espionage rarely \nmake ideal agents.\u201d (Tr. at 13-15, 26-27, 121-138; AE A-K) \nApplicant also asserted that in the extremely unlikely event that the PRC \nattempts to use his wife or his wife\u2019s family to coerce him into revealing classified \ninformation, he will immediately report it to the FBI.

(Tr. at 111-112) \nApplicant submitted letters and documents attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. He is praised for his patriotism, \ntrustworthiness, loyalty, dependability, and devotion to the United States. He is strongly \nrecommended for a security clearance. (AE O-Y) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business\nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of China and a U.S. permanent resident. His wife\u2019s \nfather and grandmother are citizens and residents of China. In-laws represent a class of \npersons who are contemplated by the Directive as presenting a potential security risk. \nAs a matter of common sense and human experience there is a rebuttable presumption \nthat a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of \nthe person\u2019s spouse. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-06831 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2011). \nChina has an authoritarian government, dominated by the Communist Party, with \na poor human rights record, and aggressively targets the U.S. for espionage. Applicant\u2019s \nChinese connections create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly to \nhim and through his wife. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nUnited States;  \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, \n499 U.S. 905 (1991). I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China and the \nadversarial relationship China has with the United States. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2019). Because of that adversarial relationship, Applicant \nhas a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d of persuasion as to mitigation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n04208 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019). In foreign influence cases, the nature of the foreign \ngovernment and its intelligence-gathering history are important considerations. There is \na rational connection between an applicant\u2019s family ties in a country whose interests are \nadverse to those of the United States and the risk that the applicant may fail to protect \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-08412 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, \n2015).  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is not close to his mother-in-law as she does not speak English, and \nhe does not speak Mandarin. His wife is not close to her father, and Applicant has never \nmet nor spoken to him. Applicant\u2019s primary association with his in-laws is through his \nwife. Applicant and his wife accepted $87,000 from her father to be used as a down \npayment on the purchase of Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s home. \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen, as are his two children. His wife is \napplying for U.S. citizenship and does not intend to return to China for a visit unless the \npolitical situation changes in China. His in-laws have no direct connection to the \nChinese government or the Communist Party. \nApplicant presented a rational position that the Government\u2019s theory of coercion \ndoes not make sense; that force of threats against loved ones is too risky for a rational \nadversary to consider; and that \u201csecrecy creates a shield against coercion.\u201d He did an \nexpansive research of reported spying and espionage cases and found that coercion \nagainst loved ones is extremely rare. He also asserted that in the extremely unlikely \nevent that the PRC attempts to use his wife or his wife\u2019s family to coerce him into \nrevealing classified information, he will immediately report it to the FBI. \nApplicant\u2019s position is not without some merit, as coercion is rare. However, it \ndoes occur, and there is little that China would not do to further its goals. A Guideline B \nadjudication is not a judgment on an applicant\u2019s character, patriotism, or loyalty to the \nUnited States. It is a determination as to whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances \nforeseeably present a security risk. See ISCR Case No. 19-00831 at 5 (App. Bd. July \n29, 2020). The concern here pertains to the risk to his Chinese relatives. Through no \nfault of his own, or for that matter his wife and in-laws, Applicant failed to meet the \u201cvery \nheavy burden\u201d of persuasion as to mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 12, 2019, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application \n(SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On November 24, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency, Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA \nCAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; Department of Defense (DOD) \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017.

(HE 2) On \nMarch 12, 2021, Applicant provided a response to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On June 1, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. Processing of the \ncase was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nOn May 3, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On June 14, 2022, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing \nfor July 28, 2022. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered four exhibits into evidence; Applicant did not offer any \nexhibits into evidence; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted \ninto evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 9, 14-16; GE 1-GE 4) On August 8, 2022, DOHA received \na transcript of the hearing. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.a, and he \ndenied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old information technology network architect who has \nworked in the same division for the same defense contractor since March 2022. (Tr. 6-7, \n17; GE 1) In 2001, he graduated from high school, and he has not attended college. (Tr. \n5, 17) He has never served in the military. (Tr. 5-6, 17) In 2020, he married, and he does \nnot have any children. (Tr. 6, 18) \nApplicant\u2019s current employer is sponsoring him for a security clearance. (Tr. 20) \nHe is not currently actively working on any federal government contracts. (Tr. 20-21) He \ncould be moved to work on a government contract in the future. (Tr. 21) He has held a \nsecurity clearance for 15 years; however, he does not need a security clearance to \nmaintain his employment. (Tr. 22, 42) There is no evidence of security violations, \nemployee discipline, arrests, or alcohol abuse. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nDecember 2018 to about November 2019. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nDecember 2018 to about November 2019, while granted access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn June 2008, the DOD granted, and in February 2014, the DOD renewed \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. (Tr. 21-22) From December 2018 to about November \n2019, he used marijuana. He worked for the same DOD contractor during this time period. \n(Tr. 19; GE 1) He did not have access to classified information when he was using \nmarijuana. (Tr. 31) He did not use marijuana on business trips or in the workplace. (Tr. \n34) He needed a security clearance to have access to his employer\u2019s facility or DOD \nfacilities on behalf of his employer; however, he did not have access to classified \ninformation. (Tr. 32-33)  \nApplicant\u2019s November 12, 2019 SCA asked about use of illegal drugs in the \nprevious seven years. (Tr. 22; GE 1) Applicant voluntarily responded that he used \nmarijuana from December 2018 to November 2019. (Tr. 23; GE 1) He explained, \n\u201cSeldom, recreational use outside of work, primarily on weekends.\u201d (GE 1 at 35) As for \nplans of future marijuana use, he said \u201cI do not intend to keep using now that I am actively \non a government contract again and it really doesn\u2019t do much for me.\u201d (Id.) In his February \n25, 2020 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, he said he used marijuana \nabout 20 times during this period. (GE 4 at 2) He used marijuana because he was curious \nabout how it would affect him. (Id.) He does not intend to use marijuana in the future \nbecause of his employment. (Id.) \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he probably used marijuana less than 20 times. (Tr. \n23) He is no longer friends with the persons who provided the marijuana to him, and he \nstopped associating with them about one year ago. (Tr. 24, 27-29) If marijuana is offered \nto Applicant, he refuses to use it. (Tr. 29)  \nApplicant\u2019s spouse had a marijuana prescription for pain, and her prescription has \nprobably expired. (Tr. 40) She sometimes used marijuana with Applicant; however, she \nstopped using marijuana in January 2022. (Tr. 24-25, 30, 41) He is not specifically aware \nof the presence of marijuana or drug paraphernalia in his house. (Tr. 30-31) He did not \nask her whether she had any remaining marijuana in their house. (Tr. 41) \nApplicant never used marijuana before or after the period December 2018 to \nNovember 2019. (Tr. 27) Marijuana is the only illegal drug he ever used. (Tr. 26-27) He \ndid not test positive on a urinalysis test for use of any illegal substances. He has 15 years \nof DOD-related employment and held a security clearance for 15 years.   \nApplicant was aware that marijuana use is illegal under federal law. (Tr. 22) \nRecreational use of marijuana is illegal in his state of residence. (Tr. 23) He knew his \nemployer opposed marijuana use by employees, and federal contractors were not \nsupposed to use marijuana. (Tr. 33-34) His employer did not conduct testing for illegal \nsubstances. (Tr. 35) He was aware that marijuana use might jeopardize his security \nclearance.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d The record establishes \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). \nAG \u00b6 25(f) is not established. Applicant held a security clearance; however, he did \nnot actually have access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 20-03111 (App. Bd. \nAug. 10, 2022) (discussing access to classified information). There is no definition in the \nDirective defining a sensitive position, and the evidence did not establish Applicant\u2019s \nposition was sensitive at the time he was possessing and using marijuana. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed his marijuana possession and \nuse during the security clearance process. He has had 15 years of DOD-related \nemployment and held a security clearance for 15 years. He indicated he does not intend \nto use marijuana in the future. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In ISCR Case No. \n16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a history of marijuana use, had, \ncompleted an SCA, but did not have an approved security clearance. The Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance and said: \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person who \nenters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by legal and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes that guidance \nto be wise. \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained \nin 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c).

An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nSee ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 20-01772 (App. Bd.

At his hearing, he indicated he does not plan or intend to use illegal drugs in \nthe future; however, I have lingering concerns about his future compliance with security \nrules because of his decisions to violate rules about possession and use of marijuana. \nGuideline H security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old information technology network architect who has \nworked for the same defense contractor in the same division since March 2022. In 2001, \nhe graduated from high school. In 2020, he married, and he does not have any children. \nApplicant\u2019s first description to security officials of his history of involvement with \nmarijuana was on his SCA. He did not test positive on a urinalysis test, and he does not \nhave any drug-related arrests. An honest and candid self-report of drug abuse is an \nimportant indication that, if granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would \ndisclose any threats to national security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that \nmight damage his or her own career or personal reputation. \nThe evidence against grant or continuation of a security clearance is more \npersuasive at this time. Applicant used marijuana less than 20 times from about \nDecember 2018 to about November 2019. His marijuana possession and use while \nholding a security clearance, but not while being granted access to classified information, \nshowed poor judgment. His marijuana possession and/or use violated federal and state \nlaw, security policies, and his employer\u2019s policy. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd.

I have \ncarefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, \nand the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. Applicant failed to mitigate drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.

He has been \nmaking timely payments to the agency pursuant to a payment arrangement and has \nreduced the debts to $1,290, as shown by documents from the agency. These debts are \nbeing resolved. (Tr. 37-42, 53, 55-56; Applicant Exhibits 2D and 2E.) \n1.h. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $334 for an account placed for collection. \nApplicant made a payment arrangement with a collection agency starting in December \n2019.

That credit report indicates this debt is a \u201cPaid charge-\noff.\u201d The report further indicates, \u201cAccount paid for less than full balance.\u201d (Applicant \nExhibit 2A at 4-6.) Given the state of the record, this allegation is found for Applicant due \nto lack of current evidence that it is still owing. (Tr. 43-45, 52.) \n1.j.

Applicant testified that he attempted to resolve this repossession before the \nautomobile was sold, but he was unsuccessful. Applicant does not feel that he should be \nresponsible for this account, since he was able and willing to resolve it when the finance \ncompany sold the car. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 34, 44-46.) \nApplicant stated that his current financial situation is stable. He is able to pay his \ndebts, support his daughter, and continue to support his wife.

Applicant \ndenied the single allegation under this paragraph. \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Department of \nDefense in April 2019. The investigator prepared a detailed Report of Investigation (ROI). \n(Government Exhibit 2 at 4-13.) The interview was extensive, and the investigator \ncovered with Applicant all the debts set forth in Paragraph 1, above. The interview also \ncovered debts that had a zero balance. Applicant stated in his Answer, \u201cIn my previous \ninvestigations I admitted to the debt. My previous investigations accounted for my \nfinancial matters.\u201d \nApplicant filled out an e-QIP on September 9, 2019. (Government Exhibit 1.) \nSection 26 asked various questions about Applicant\u2019s financial status. He admitted the \ndebt set forth in SOR 1.a. He then answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to having any other delinquencies. \nThis was a false answer to a relevant question about Applicant\u2019s financial condition. In \nhis Answer Applicant stated, \u201cAll of these discrepancies have been addressed previously \nin my interview for renewing my secret clearance several years back, as well as my \ninterview for my initial TS in 2017. Reading through my entire SI [Subject Interview], all of \nthese discrepancies are listed, along with the explanations I have provided here.\u201d He also \nstated a concern that the credit report he had at the time of the interview did not show \nseveral of the debts referred to by the investigator. (See Tr. 24-27, 29-35.) \nApplicant also testified extensively about his thought processes while filling out the \ne-QIP. He repeatedly stated he was confused about what debts needed to be listed, since \nhe had previously been interviewed. The following testimony is indicative: \n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m still confused by it [the e-QIP]. It\u2019s hard - - I get lost in the \nweeds - - I guess I could say - - filling these out, and I\u2019m still not sure if I \ncovered these in an investigation if they are also outside the seven-year \nwindow if I have to go back and read them because they are outside the \nwindow as well as already covered in the investigation. I\u2019m still confused on \nwhat I\u2019m supposed to put in there. (Tr. 28.) \nMitigation \nApplicant is a well-respected employee. Supervisors and coworkers identify \nApplicant as a successful, respected, and honest employee and person. One coworker, \nwho is also a friend, stated the following, \u201c[Applicant] is a loyal, thoughtful, friend, a good \nfather to his daughter, a proven leader, proficient in his chosen vocation, and I\u2019m proud \nthat he is my close friend.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits A through C.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant owed approximately $41,900 for seven past-due debts and three \nautomobile repossessions as of the date the SOR was issued. These facts establish \nprima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. He is paying everyday debts and \nmaking timely payments on his consolidated medical bills in accordance with an \nagreement with the collection agency. One debt, 1.h, was resolved in full before issuance \nof the SOR. \nAll of the financial issues set forth in the SOR are related to Applicant\u2019s marriage \nin one way or another. His wife chose to live in a different state than Applicant, requiring \nhim to support two households. His wife had serious and tragic medical issues in relation \nto her second pregnancy. This resulted in the medical debts and at least one of the \nrepossessions. Applicant at first indicated a reluctance to resolve the repossessions, if \nresolution is possible. However, he now evinces a credible intent to attempt to reach an \nagreement with the creditors. Applicant has behaved responsibly in resolving his debts. \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks \nomitted).  \nGiven his resources, Applicant has initiated a pragmatic approach to the \nrepayment of his past-due SOR debts and has taken significant steps to resolve the debts. \nApplicant has the knowledge and ability that will allow him to stay on a proper financial \nfooting. He has fully mitigated all the financial concern allegations in the SOR. Paragraph \n1 is found for Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant had delinquent debts. He did not fully report these facts on his e-QIP. \nThe above disqualifying condition has application to this case. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification: \n \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Defense Department several \nmonths before filling out the e-QIP at issue. During that interview all of the debts set forth \nunder Paragraph 1, and referred to in Paragraph 2, were discussed in detail. The \ntestimony elicited from Applicant showed that he was confused by the form and by his \nresponsibility to be forthcoming on the e-QIP, since the government already had \nknowledge of the debts based on prior interviews with him. Applicant\u2019s interpretation of \nwhat he was supposed to describe was wrong, but was not a willful falsification. Based \non the available evidence, I find that Applicant did not have the requisite intent to deceive \nwhen he filled out the e-QIP. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation and personal conduct. The situation regarding \nhis debts is being resolved in a responsible manner, and does not evince poor judgment \nor unreliability. Applicant\u2019s misstatements on the e-QIP do not arise to willful falsification. \nHe has minimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, as well as the likelihood \nof recurrence. Overall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

He was involved with a charity at his \nPolice Department. The charity was grossly understaffed. He was the treasurer, and \ninadvertently commingled his personal check book with that of the charity. As a result, \nhe was terminated from his employment, in January 2013, nearly ten years ago. \nPersecution was declined, as there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to prove embezzlement.\u201d \n(TR at page 16 line 5 to page 27 line 17, at page 43 line 14 to page 44 line 25, and \nAppX F.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n3 \n\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. He filed \nfor the protection of bankruptcy; and as a result, he has no past-due indebtedness. \nApplicant has received financial counseling, has a positive monthly cash flow, and has \nsignificantly increased his credit score. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. \nFinancial Considerations is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n5 \n\n \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; \nApplicant was terminated from his employment as a police officer in 2013 over \naccusations of embezzlement. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nProsecution was declined for the alleged embezzlement occurred a decade ago. \nSo much time has passed; and the incident occurred under such unique circumstances, \nthat it is unlikely to recur. Personal Conduct is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace, as noted by his supervisor. (AppX A.) He performs well \nat his job. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.o: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

No \ndocuments show those payments being \nmade. \n** Response docsuments show six \npayments at $45/mo. from 7/21 to 12/21. \nThe legal effect of those Findings of Fact are discussed below in the Analysis. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (d)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies occurred recently and persist to this day. I cannot find \nthat AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. AG \u00b6 20(d) requires an analysis of each SOR debt. That analysis \nfollows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b61.a. and 1.f. Applicant has admitted these allegations. She claims that she \nhas a monthly payment plan in place, but her documents do not support that claim. I find \nagainst Applicant on these two allegations. \nSOR \u00b61.b. Applicant denies this allegation and believes it is a duplicate. She cites \nthe absence of this account on her credit report. That report, however, does not mention \nthat debt or show that it has been resolved. The Government\u2019s evidence shows the \naccount to be in collection. I find against Applicant on this allegation. \nSOR \u00b61.c. and d. Applicant\u2019s documents show five payments of $45 per month \nfrom September 28, 2020 to January 27, 2021 and six payments of $45 per month from \nJuly 27, 2021 to December 27, 2021. Applicant\u2019s documents show eleven months of \npayments from September 2020 to December 2021 with, however, an unexplained five \nmonth hiatus in payments from February 2021 to June 2021. This is not a sufficiently \nmeaningful track record to establish that Applicant is enroute to resolving these debts. I \nfind against Applicant on these two allegations. \nSOR \u00b61.e. Applicant claimed she forgot this account but would pay it. She \nsubmitted no documents that she paid this account. I find against Applicant on this \naccount. \nSOR \u00b61.g. Applicant submitted no documents that she paid this account, has a \npayment plan in place, or disputes this account. I find against Applicant on this account. \nSOR \u00b61.h. Applicant\u2019s documents show she paid this account in full. I find in favor \nof Applicant on this account.  \nTwo tenets of Appeal Board jurisprudence inform the above analysis. First, the \nBoard has stated that it is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present \ndocumentation showing that debts have been resolved or are being resolved. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008). Second, an applicant must show \na meaningful track record of some form of debt repayment. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n                            \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant failed on both points (except for SOR \u00b61.h.). AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about her eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.h.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

The Government\u2019s written \nbrief with supporting documents, known as the file of relevant material (FORM), was \nsubmitted by Department Counsel on November 17, 2021. A complete copy of the FORM \nwas provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, rebut, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM \non January 14, 2022. He did not respond to the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s \nexhibits, or submit additional documentary evidence for my consideration. The case was \nassigned to me on March 30, 2022. Government Exhibits (GE) 2 through 4 are admitted \ninto evidence without objection. GE 1 is the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer, which are \nalready part of the record. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 29-year-old process mechanic and aircraft painter, employed by a \ndefense contractor since April 2019. He graduated from high school in 2012. He is \nunmarried and has no children. This is his first security clearance application. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nthat Applicant used marijuana on various occasions between at least June 2009 and \nJanuary 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and that in August 2016, he was charged with DWI \u2013 drug \nintoxication, resisting arrest by flight, and felony property damage. He was convicted of \nDWI and placed on probation for two years. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), the SOR cross-alleged in \u00b6 2.a, the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Also, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his May \n2019 SCA by failing to disclose his criminal charges and DWI conviction as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, and past drug use as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c) Finally, the \nSOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts in the answers provided in his August \n2019 personal subject interview (PSI), wherein he failed to disclose his felony charge and \nalcohol-related offense as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (SOR \u00b6 2.d) \nIn his 2019 SCA, Applicant noted that he had no history of illegal drug use, alcohol-\nrelated charges, arrests, convictions, or other criminal/police activity. When he was first \ninterviewed by an investigator in August 2019, he twice denied ever being charged with \na felony or any offense involving alcohol. When the investigator confronted him with \ninformation about his charges and conviction in August 2016, he asserted that it was not \nsupposed to be part of his record so he did not think it needed to be listed on his SCA. \nHe described the incident, changed parts of his story, and then stated that he purposely \nomitted the arrest, assuming it would not be on his record or raised in the investigation \nand that he wanted to keep his business private. He stated that he was happy to have his \njob and did not want or think he needed a security clearance. \nIn his response to Government interrogatories and in his PSI, Applicant admitted \nto daily marijuana use from June 2009 to January 2019.

He used marijuana alone or whenever given the chance. \nHe purposely omitted the information from his SCA as he did not think it would ever come \nup or be included in the police report. He claimed to have no immediate intention to use \nmarijuana again, but left open the possibility of using it after he retired if it was legal. He \nalso admitted his August 2016 arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. He stated \nin his response to interrogatories that he pleaded guilty and \u201ca deal was made if I go two \nyears under probation with no re-occurring incidents, then the DUI would be removed \nfrom [his] record, case is currently closed with everything complete.\u201d His Federal Bureau \nof Investigation (FBI) criminal history shows Applicant was charged in August 2016 for \nDWI-drug intoxication, resisting arrest, property damage, and felony property damage 1st  \ndegree. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24:  \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \nApplicant used marijuana daily between June 2009 and January 2019, and was \nalso charged with DWI \u2013 drug involvement. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.

He \nclaims to have stopped before he began his current employment. Although he told the \ninvestigator in his PSI that he had no intention of continuing illegal drug use, he did not \nprovide a signed statement as contemplated by AG \u00b6 26(b), nor did he convince me of a \nsufficient pattern of abstinence, a change in circumstances, efforts to acknowledge a \nhabitual drug use problem or efforts to overcome it, disassociating from drug-using \nassociates, or a change to the environment where drugs were used in the past. \nInsufficient time has passed since he stopped using illegal drugs, and I do not find \nthat the circumstances in which he used drugs in the past are unlikely to recur. Of further \nconcern is that Applicant falsely denied drug use in his SCA. Applicant\u2019s history of drug \nuse continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nNo mitigating condition fully applies. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b616 are: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

I am not satisfied that sufficient \ntime has passed or that Applicant has shown that this conduct is behind him and will not \nrecur. He noted his omissions were intentional and stemmed from his belief that a security \nclearance was not necessary for his employment, and his desire to keep his business \nprivate. His behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Nothing has submitted to persuade me that these personal conduct concerns \nwill not persist. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, PSI, and interrogatory responses. Based on Applicant\u2019s lack of \nresponse to the FORM, I am not convinced that Applicant is willing or able to permanently \nput his past misconduct aside and show good judgment in all areas of his life, especially \nthose that are relevant to security eligibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \namended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n   Subparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \nGregg A.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 34 years old and has married twice, first in 2005 and later in 2012. \nBoth marriages ended in divorce. She has one child. She receives no child support from \nthe father of the child. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2016 and a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin May 2018. She put herself through college as an adult. Since June 2018, Applicant has \nbeen employed by a large defense contractor as a manufacturing engineer earning an \nannual salary of $110,000. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in relation to her \nemployment. She is a first-time applicant. (Tr. at 15-17, 21.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause of her conviction on a felony charge in May 2007 and because she falsified \ninformation in her e-QIP by failing to disclose the conviction, a related criminal charge, \nand her sentence of probation. In her Answer Applicant admitted the three SOR \nallegations with clarifications. \nApplicant testified that she was arrested in May 2007 in Georgia and charged with \ntwo felonies, Murder and Concealing the Death of Another. She pled guilty to the second\ncharge, and in December 2009, she was sentenced to probation for ten years. (Tr. at 17-\n18; GE 2 at 11.) \n \nApplicant described the events that gave rise to her arrest. A male friend was \ndriving Applicant and a female friend inside a parking lot to drop them off at Applicant\u2019s \ncar. Applicant was sitting in the front passenger seat next to her male friend, and the \nfemale friend was sitting in the backseat behind the driver. While in the rear seat, \nApplicant\u2019s female friend was playing with a loaded handgun, which belong to her \nboyfriend. The driver stopped the car suddenly when he dropped a marijuana cigarette \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand burned himself. Applicant\u2019s female friend accidentally fired the gun and the bullet \nstruck the driver. The car sped up running into other vehicles and finally stopped. \nApplicant and her female friend jumped out of the car, heard police sirens, and fled out of \nfear. Applicant was 20 years old at the time. Her girlfriend was 16. Applicant got into her \ncar with her girlfriend and drove to a neighboring state where her parents lived. Applicant \nsubsequently learned that her male friend died of the gunshot. (Tr. at 18-21, 31-40; GE 2 \nat 5.) \nApplicant believes that her deceased friend was involved in selling drugs based on \nhow he carried himself and his lack of a legitimate job. Applicant was never involved in \nhis drug-related activities. She subsequently turned herself in to the local police where \nthe shooting occurred. She was originally charged with murder. She hired a criminal \nattorney. The murder charge was eventually dropped before Applicant went to court. \nApplicant pled guilty to the felony charge of Concealing the Death of Another. After five \nyears of probation, the court terminated her probation for good behavior in response to a \nmotion by her defense attorney. She had completed all of the terms and conditions of her \nprobation. The court subsequently ordered that the court record in her case be sealed. \nHer female friend was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to serve \nsome prison time. Applicant has had no contact with that friend for the last five years. (Tr. \nat 19-21, 25, 28-29, 31-40; GE 2 at 5-6, 15; AE H; AE I.) \nSince 2007, Applicant has consulted with her attorney whenever she has a \nquestion about the criminal case and in particular the early termination of her probation \nand the sealing of the court record. She consulted with him in September 2018 when she \nwas preparing her e-QIP. She testified that she was not comfortable with the legal terms \nused in the e-QIP question about her criminal record. In a phone call, her defense attorney \nadvised her to answer these questions in the negative because her case was sealed. He \ndid not have the e-QIP in front of him when she spoke with him. As a result, he did not \nread the introductory language to Section 22 of the e-QIP, which reads: \u201cFor this section \nreport information regardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed, \nexpunged, or otherwise stricken from the court record, or the charge was dismissed.\u201d He \nalso advised her that she can disclose her record and provide the details about her \ncriminal record at her background interview. Accordingly, she did not disclose her record \nin her e-QIP. She testified that this advice made sense to her at the time because she \nthought her answers on the e-QIP would then be consistent with the available criminal \nrecords, which she believed would not show her arrest and conviction because they were \nsealed. (Tr. at 21-24, 28, 41-47, 52, 59-62; GE 1 at 40.) \nIn her testimony she confirmed her statement in her Answer that she never \nintended to conceal her criminal record. She credibly testified that she believed that her \ncriminal record would come up in the interview. She explained how the interview was \nconducted. She told the interviewer at the beginning of the interview that she had a \nconcern about an e-QIP question. The interviewer told her that they would get to her \nquestion when they discussed the relevant section of her e-QIP. When the e-QIP section \nregarding the subject of a police record was discussed, she brought up the events of 2007 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand provided a detailed statement of the facts and documentation from the criminal case. \nShe was the first to mention that she had experienced a criminal charge that was not \nlisted on her e-QIP. She disputed the wording of the interview summary in which the \ninvestigator wrote that he \u201cconfronted\u201d Applicant about the events in May 2007. She \nvoluntarily disclosed her criminal record during her background interview and made no \nattempt to conceal it. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 21-24, 28, 41-47, 52, 59-62.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted significant whole-person evidence. A lot has changed in \nApplicant\u2019s life since 2007. She no longer associates with people like the shooting victim \nor others involved in criminal activities. One exhibit was a picture of the home she owns \nin which she raises her child. Her mother also lives with her. She purchased the property \nwith a mortgage loan. (Answer at 3; Tr. 44-47; AE K.) \nApplicant testified that she was not vulnerable to blackmail by what happened \nwhen she was 20. She said that it was a \u201ctragedy,\u201d but she does not feel responsible for \nwhat happened. She is not embarrassed by the event. Her direct manager is aware of \nthis incident. Two others co-workers are also aware of it. (Tr. at 27, 44-47.)      \nApplicant is a highly respected employee of her clearance sponsor. Supervisors \nand coworkers identify Applicant as a successful, respected, and honest employee and \nperson. They praise her integrity, professionalism, and motivation to excel. One coworker, \nwho is also a friend, described Applicant\u2019s significant leadership skills. A supervisor wrote \nthat Applicant \u201cis self-driven and takes on new challenges with keen intelligence.\u201d (AE A \nat 1-4; AE B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following conditions that could raise security concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that that individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant has a criminal record of a felony conviction. Also, she did not report on \nher e-QIP that she had another felony charge, that she had been charged with an offense \ninvolving a firearm, and that she had been on probation within the seven-year period \npreceding her submission of the e-QIP. Also, her actions and associations in the past \nwhen she was 20 years old raise independent security concerns. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply in this case. \nThe adjudicative guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged falsifications and past actions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n, \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed by the advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully.  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nAll of the above mitigating conditions apply. The criminal charge occurred so long \nago, when Applicant was 20 years old, that it no longer raises serious security concerns \nin light of how she has turned her life around. She is now a college graduate with an \nimpressive career. She is a single mother raising a child in a house, which she owns. She \nis not ashamed of her past and is proud of her present circumstances and her future. She \nis not vulnerable to exploitation. She no longer associates with individuals involved in \ncriminal activities. Her past behavior does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nMoreover, Applicant has established that her e-QIP responses to the questions \nregarding her police record were not deliberate falsifications. She relied upon the advice \nof the attorney who had successfully represented her for more than ten years in navigating \nthe criminal justice system. Although his advice was incorrect, she relied upon that advice \nin good faith knowing that she could disclose her criminal record and the surrounding \nfacts and circumstances at the time of her background interview, which is exactly what \nshe did. She also established that she made a prompt good-faith effort to correct the \nomissions of her criminal record and probation before being confronted with the facts. \nThe investigator\u2019s summary of the interview during which she made these disclosures \nstates that he \u201cconfronted\u201d her initially. Applicant credibly testified that this was incorrect. \nThe Government offered no witness to contradict her testimony on the issue of \nconfrontation. Based on the available evidence, I find that Applicant did not have the \nrequisite intent to deceive when she filled out the e-QIP and made a prompt good-faith \ndisclosure of her criminal record during her interview before being confronted. SOR \nParagraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding her personal conduct. On her own initiative, she turned her life around \nand has become an impressive, well-educated young woman with a brilliant career and \nlife ahead of her. She has minimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, as \nwell as the likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence does not raise any \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and \na security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

A hearing was scheduled for April \n19, 2022, by TEAMS remote video-teleconference. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s \ncase consisted of four exhibits. (GEs 1-4) Applicant relied on five exhibits (AEs A-E) \nand one witness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 5, 2022. \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with updated documentation of his \naddressing his 2015-2019 federal and state income tax returns. For good cause shown, \nApplicant was granted seven days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was \nafforded three days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the \nrecord with documented updates of taxes owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for \ntax years 2015-2019. Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted as AEs F-G. \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) accumulated a delinquent consumer \ndebt for $13,248; b) failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 \nthrough 2019 and is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for $18,620 for \ndelinquent federal income taxes; and (c) failed to timely file his state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2015 through 2019 and is indebted to his state of residence for $18,363 for \ndelinquent state income taxes. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the three allegations (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c with explanations. He claimed he was working \nwith a credit financial advisor to fix any outstanding debts (inclusive of his SOR \u00b6 1.a \ndebt). He also claimed he filed his late federal tax returns and is waiting for documented \nreceipt of his returns from the IRS. He further claimed that he has filed his state tax \nreturns for tax years 2015-2019 and is waiting for confirmation. Addressing his finances \nin general, Applicant claimed that he ran into financial hardships in 2017 with \nunexpected events (inclusive of paying for his child\u2019s health bills) and is now in a better \nplace financially with secure employment to fix his debt.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing obligations and debt \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. \n14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited financial difficulties associated with his failure to timely file \nhis federal and state tax returns for multiple years (2015-2019) and address his accrued \ndelinquent taxes and auto loan deficiency in a more responsible way preclude him from \ntaking advantage of most of the potentially available extenuating and mitigating benefits. \nWhile some extenuating benefit to Applicant is warranted based on the \nemergency medical circumstances of his daughter that placed some strains on his \npersonal finances, his cited multiple failures to timely file his federal and state tax \nreturns, as required, and failure to address his federal and state income tax and car \nloan delinquencies in a responsible way once his finances improved significantly limit  \nthe potential availability of extenuating and mitigating benefits to him. \nAs a result, application of mitigating condition MC 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has only partial application to \nApplicant\u2019s situation.

On September 6, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel answered the SOR (Answer) on September 17, 2021, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on November 5, 2021. The case was initially assigned to another judge and \nthen was reassigned to me on March 23, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Video Teleconference Hearing on April 25, 2022, \nscheduling the hearing for May 23, 2022. Due to a last-minute submission of documents \nby Applicant\u2019s counsel, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s request for a brief continuance. \nThe case was heard as rescheduled on June 1, 2022. \nDepartment Counsel offered nine exhibits marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 9, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf \nand submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through J, which were also admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 14, 2022. (Tr. at 9-\n13.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 38 years old and has never been married. He has no children. He \ngraduated from high school in 2001. He has worked for Federal contractors as an \nelectronics technician since 2008.

March 2006 traffic citations \u2013 seat belt and no insurance. On March 10, \n2006, Applicant was cited for two driving violations. He was 23 years old at the time and \nwas living at his home with his mother.

In addition, \nApplicant failed to pay the assessed fine and a warrant was issued in July 2006. In \nOctober 2006, the court set aside the guilty plea and fine for the insurance violation. \nApplicant paid the remaining fine in full on November 27, 2006. Applicant presented \nevidence at the hearing showing that he now has insurance for his vehicle. He admitted \nthat he acted immaturely at that time.

May 2008 possession of marijuana and driving an unregistered vehicle. \nOn May 4, 2008, Applicant was charged with drug possession and operating an \nunregistered vehicle. In the summary of his background interview, Applicant is reported \nas stating that the original drug charge was for a felony. The Government\u2019s court records \nreflect that this charge was for a misdemeanor, however, no police records were \nsubmitted into evidence to permit a review of the original charge by the police. On June \n17, 2008, Applicant pled guilty to misdemeanor marijuana possession and was fined. \nApplicant testified that he no longer uses drugs and he does not drink alcohol. His last \nuse of marijuana was in about 2008. He prefers to have a clear, focused mental condition. \nHe knows that marijuana use is legal under laws of the state in which he resides (State \n1), but he also understands that Federal law and his work for the Federal Government \nprohibit his use of marijuana. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 17-18, 46-47; GE 4 at 2; GE 8 at 1-4.) \n1.c. January 2013 domestic battery arrest. Applicant admits he was arrested on \nthis charge, but he denies the underlying allegation of domestic battery. He had a physical \naltercation with his then-girlfriend (Woman A) during an argument outside of a club, which \nwas observed by a police officer. In an affidavit, Woman A wrote that Applicant violently \npushed her. Applicant blames this arrest on a \u201ctoxic relationship\u201d he had with the victim, \nwhich he claimed was due to her mental illness. Applicant admitted both he and Woman \nA were intoxicated at the time of his arrest. He testified that no charges were filed. \nApplicant and Woman A started dating in 2012 and separated in 2016. Applicant testified \nthat he has never had an issue of domestic abuse with any woman before or after the \none involved in this incident. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 18-19, 47-50; GE 2 at 4; GE 7 at 10.) \n1.d. September 2016 restraining order due to domestic violence. On July 18, \n2016, Woman A obtained a temporary court restraining order for protection from Applicant \nbased upon her claims that applicant had physically abused her. Applicant believes that \nshe initiated the proceedings against him because he had terminated their relationship. \nHe testified that he was surprised that she sought the court order because he had never \nbeen violent with her. The woman claimed in her court papers that she sought to leave \nhim and he reacted violently towards her. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied that he \nhad ever been violent with her, but admitted that \u201cwe [did] tussle together.\u201d The court \npapers were served on Applicant on August 15, 2016. A preliminary court date had been \ncontinued on August 4, 2016, because Applicant had not been served at that time. The \nSOR alleges that Applicant evaded service of the restraining order. This allegation was \nbased upon court papers reflecting five unsuccessful attempts to serve the court papers \non Applicant at his residence in State 1. In his Answer, Applicant admitted that the court \nentered a restraining order against him, but he denies that he evaded service. He claimed \nhe was not aware of the order until it was served. The restraining order was ultimately \ndismissed on October 20, 2020, at the request of Woman A. (Answer at 2-3; Tr. at 19-20, \n50-54, 61-64; GE 7 at 44, 49; Answer Ex. 1.) \n1.e.

Applicant failed to appear in court on \nDecember 1, 2016, to pay the first installment of the fine and a civil assessment was \nordered. Applicant testified that he was working in another state for an extended period \nof time and upon his return to State 1, he resolved the citation. He began paying the fine \nin January 2018 and finished paying it in October 2018. He was unable to explain why he \ndid not have a valid driver\u2019s license at the time of the citation. He described generally that \nhis driver\u2019s license had been suspended at some time due to his failures to appear in \ncourt. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 21-23, 54-56; GE 6 at 3-6; Answer Ex. 2-4.) \n1.f. August 2019 \u2013 traffic citation for speeding (86/65). \n \nOn October 22, 2019, \nApplicant failed to appear in court to respond to a speeding citation. The court docket in \nthe record reflects that he failed to appear in court again on November 7, 2019, February \n11, 2020, and August 14, 2020. The docket also shows that he appeared in court on \nFebruary 21, 2020, and pled not guilty. Applicant claims that he appeared at the initial \ncourt hearing and requested a trial. He went to court for the trial and the courthouse was \nclosed due to the COVID pandemic. He testified that he never heard further about a court \ndate. His employer subsequently relocated him to State 2 for an extended period of time \nto manage a project. He claimed he was unaware of the warrant until he received the \nSOR. He wrote in his Answer that he intends to go to court and address the citation and \nwarrant. As of December 30, 2020, the amount of the unpaid fine was $882. At the DOHA \nhearing, he provided evidence of payment of the fine in the amount of $1,010 on May 23, \n2022, a week before the hearing. Applicant testified that he now understands that he can \nhire an attorney to represent him in any future legal problems and avoid missing court \ndates when he is away from home due to his work responsibilities. He admitted that he \nhad been irresponsible missing the November 2019 court date. (Answer 3; Tr. at 23-25, \n56-59; GE 5 at 1-3; AE C.) \nParagraph 2 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause of his unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, raising questions about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. The \nSOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns as \nrequired for tax years (TYs) 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (SOR 2.a). The SOR also alleges \nthat Applicant failed to pay his State 1 fine and penalties in connection with the traffic \ncitation alleged in SOR 1.f (SOR 2.b). The specific details are as follows: \n2.a. Failure to timely file Federal and state taxes. In his Answer, Applicant \nadmitted that he failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2016 and \n2018 through 2020 in a timely manner. He asserted that the returns have now been filed. \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that his failures to file his returns was \u201cmostly\u201d due to \nhis work-related travel schedule for extended periods of time. His exhibits include \nunsigned copies of his Federal tax returns for TY 2018 and 2020 that were prepared by \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na tax professional. The TY 2018 return is undated and reflects a balance due in the \namount of $3,792 and the TY 2020 return reflects a refund due to Applicant in the amount \nof $731. The TY 2020 tax return is dated July 14, 2021, which would have been about \ntwo months late in the absence of an extension to file past the due date, which was \nextended to May 17, 2021, for that tax year due to the COVID pandemic. Applicant \nprovided no documentary evidence that he filed for an extension in 2021. He testified that \nthe other tax returns were filed in about September 2021, after he received the SOR. \nGiven the limited information in the record, counsel for the Government and Applicant \nstipulated to Applicant\u2019s testimony that his tax returns for TYs 2016, 2018-2020 were filed, \nbut they were not filed on time. Applicant testified that he intends to file his returns in a \ntimely manner in the future using the services of a tax professional. (Answer at 4; Tr. at \n26, 64-; GE 2 at 5; AE D through I.) \nApplicant testified further that he entered into a payment plan in 2021 to pay his \nFederal tax debt of about $4,000 for TY 2018. He pays the Federal Government about \n$200 per month. He also had a tax liability to State 1 for the same year. The state \ngarnished his wages to collect that debt. He has now fully paid the state tax debt. With \ninterest and penalties, his total Federal and state tax debt for 2018 was about $9,000. \nThis liability arose due to Applicant withdrawing funds from his 401k account in 2018 to \npay off a car loan and a credit card. (Tr. at 69-74.) \n2.b. Failure to pay State 1 fine and penalties. Applicant asserted in his Answer \nthat he has retained an attorney to address the underlying infraction and fine. As noted in \nthe discussion of the facts surrounding SOR 1.f, above, Applicant provided evidence that \nhe paid this fine of about $1,000 on May 23, 2022, shortly before the hearing date of June \n1, 2022. He testified that he did not pay this fine earlier because he was unaware of it \nprior to receiving the SOR. (Answer at 4; Tr. at 73-74; GE 5 at 2; AE C.) \nParagraph 3 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe Government cross-alleges in this paragraph all of the allegations set forth in \nparagraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR. The SOR states that conduct involving questionable \njudgment or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations raises questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. In his Answer, Applicant denied that his personal conduct demonstrates an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. (Answer at 4.) \nMitigation \nThe Director of Operations of Applicant\u2019s employer and security clearance sponsor \nprovided a strong character reference praising Applicant\u2019s reliability and good moral \ncharacter.

He manages large and important contracts for one of the U.S. military services \ninstalling technical equipment, which requires experience, skills, scheduling, and project \nplanning. He worked for his prior employer for about three years and another employer \nfor about ten years before that. Both of his prior jobs and his current employment involved \nthe same type of Defense Department contract work. In his last job, he lived and worked \nin State 2. Starting in about 2019 he began working as a team lead, and more recently \nhe managed about 30 technicians. Applicant worked ten or more hours a day, six days a \nweek. He was voted \u201cEmployee of the Year.\u201d His good work for that company opened the \nopportunity he has with his current employer. In his new job, he will be managing a team \nof about 60 technicians. Applicant is a relatively young person to have so much \nresponsibility. In his new position as a manager, he has more responsibility and his pay \nis accordingly higher. Over the years, his hourly pay rate has increased from $14.50 to \nabout $45. His new position also requires him to work long hours with much overtime. His \nincome increased to well over $100,000 in 2021. (Tr. at 27-37, 42-43.) \nThe Defense Department contracts on which Applicant works often require him to \nbe on site in another state for long periods of time. As a result, when he is residing in \nState 1, he lives with his mother. He testified that this situation was the main reason why \nhe missed court dates and did not file his taxes in a timely manner. He also admitted that \nhe has been irresponsible in the past, but claims that behavior has changed. He believes \nthat he has shown \u201ctremendous growth since those situations [alleged in the SOR] \nhappen[ed]. They have all been taken care of. And they are all things that will not occur \nagain.\u201d (Tr. at 28-36, 76.) \nApplicant has learned from his employment the importance of planning and taking \ncare of both his work requirements and those of his personal life. He realizes he can no \nlonger afford to be irresponsible in his handling of his personal affairs. He claims he is \nnow much more responsible than he has ever been. He understands that the four most \nrecent incidents listed under Guideline J, and both of the financial issues alleged under \nGuideline F, arose while he held a security clearance. His receipt of the SOR has \nprompted him to reexamine how he has handled his taxes and other legal responsibilities. \nApplicant understands that he has a highly supportive attorney who has known him since \nhis childhood and is available to take care of any legal problems Applicant encounters. \nApplicant now also has a tax professional to file his income tax returns every year in a \ntimely fashion. Applicant\u2019s 2021 tax returns were filed prior to the filing deadline in April \n2022. He also commented that he has not been arrested or given a citation since the \n2019 speeding incident. (Tr. at 29-38, 59.) \nApplicant is determined to avoid repeating the tumultuous relationship he had with \nWoman A for four years (2012 to 2016). He is now in a stable relationship with a woman \nhe wants to marry. He and his girlfriend plan to raise a family together. She has a \ndoctorate degree in physical therapy. They presently have no difficult relationship issues, \nbut they are engaged in counseling to help them learn to communicate better and avoid \nissues that can be disruptive to their relationship.

(Tr. at 38-41.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct and his failures to appear in court when required, as \nalleged in the SOR, are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and in his \ntestimony. These facts shift the burden to Applicant to establish mitigation. AG \u00b6 32 sets \nforth four mitigating conditions under Guideline J. The following two mitigating conditions \nhave possible application to the facts in this case: \n(a) so much time has passed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nNeither of the above mitigating conditions have been sufficiently established to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s long pattern of irresponsible and \nuntrustworthy behavior. He did not pay his 2019 fine for speeding until about a week \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbefore the hearing. Applicant\u2019s pattern of behavior dating back to 2006 reflects an \nunwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Insufficient time has passed to \npermit a conclusion that his past behavior will not be repeated. That pattern of behavior \ncasts doubts on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. \nApplicant has presented some important evidence of rehabilitation. He has \ndramatically risen to a high level of responsibility in his employment. His claims of making \nchanges in his personal life, however, have not been established by a track record of \nresponsible adult behavior. He needs more time to demonstrate that his intention to act \nresponsibly and comply with basic rules of society, such as showing up in court when \nrequired and paying fines in a timely manner, will be matched by his actions. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence of rehabilitation does not fully establish mitigation of the security concerns \nraised in this case. Paragraph 1 is resolved against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for TYs 2016 and 2018 \nthrough 2020, as required. Also, Applicant failed to pay a fine for speeding given in 2019 \nuntil May 2022, a week before the hearing. The DOHA Appeal Board has stated that a \n\u201cfailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with \nwell-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules \nand systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-04437 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). The record evidence establishes the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe two financial issues set forth in paragraph 2 of the SOR are related in that they \nreflect an unwillingness or inability to comply with rules and regulations. They occurred \nover a number of years up to and including 2021, when Applicant filed his tax returns late, \nincluding his 2020 returns. His failure to pay a speeding citation until the eve of the hearing \nin this case brings his financial irresponsibility up to the present and casts doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) \nhas not been established. \nApplicant has now paid the debt alleged in SOR 2.b. The fact that the debt was not \npaid until he had to appear at a DOHA hearing on his eligibility to hold a security clearance \nsignificantly undercuts the good-faith nature of his actions. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) \nhas not been established. \nThe preponderance of record evidence indicates that Applicant has filed his TY \n2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 Federal and state income tax returns. He did so in \nSeptember 2021 after receiving the SOR. This timing undercuts the mitigation value of \nhis actions under AG \u00b6 20(g). Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nTo the extent that it is deemed that the credible adverse information established \nunder Guidelines J and F are insufficient to support an adverse national security eligibility \ndetermination under one of both of those guidelines, the above potentially disqualifying \ncondition is established. The record evidence demonstrates that Applicant has engaged \nin a pattern of conduct that supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, indicating that he may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This assessment is particularly compelling due to the fact that most of the \nadverse personal conduct occurred after he had been granted a security clearance in \n2009. Accordingly, the record evidence of disqualifying conduct shifts the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate these concerns. \nThe guideline includes one condition in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAlthough some of the incidents set forth in the SOR involve relatively minor traffic \ninfractions, Applicant\u2019s failures to appear and his general indifference to his legal \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nresponsibilities create a substantial concern that his untrustworthy behavior will continue. \nHe has not had sufficient opportunity since his untimely payment of a large fine in May \n2022 to establish a track record of responsible, adult behavior. His evidence in mitigation \nis impressive, but it is too soon to conclude that Applicant\u2019s history of irresponsible \npersonal conduct has indeed changed. Paragraph 3 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines J, F, and E, in light of all pertinent facts and circumstances of this case. \nApplicant has not met his burden to establish mitigation of the security concerns under \nany of the three guidelines. He is a relatively young man with the potential for an excellent \nfuture ahead of him. Unfortunately, he is just beginning to realize that future. He has had \ninsufficient time and opportunity to develop a track record of compliance with rules, \nregulations, and court orders to establish that his past irresponsibility will not continue. \nApplicant is still paying every month toward his Federal tax liability for TY 2018. The fact \nthat most of the conduct set forth in the SOR occurred after Applicant had been granted \nnational security eligibility for access to classified information is particularly troubling. He \nis now just learning that the privilege of holding a security clearance carries with it \nsignificant responsibilities.

Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 25, 2019, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF-86). On December 2, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency, Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The SOR \ndetailed reasons why the CAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nOn January 3, 2021, Applicant submitted his Answer to the SOR. On March 17, \n2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On March 24, 2021, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On May 10, 2021, \nDOHA issued a notice of DCS video teleconference hearing, scheduling the hearing for \nJune 30, 2021. The hearing was convened as scheduled.

(Tr. 24) When \nhe returned to college after his accident, the on-campus medical team prescribed him \n\u201csome prescription-grade\u201d pain medications. After college, his doctors prescribed \nvarious pain medication options to include opioids. He chose not to use opioids given \ntheir addictive qualities, especially after observing many individuals in the spinal cord \ninjury community become addicted to opioids. Rather, he chose to live with his pain and \ntake only over-the-counter medications like Advil. (Tr. 18-19, 42-44, 46, 61; AE K) \nIn about 2008 or 2009, Applicant began participating in an adaptive sports \nprogram and met other wheelchair users who could relate to his situation.

(Tr. 19-21, 24-25, 44-45) \nApplicant considered using marijuana to control his pain after learning of success \nstories from fellow members of the spinal cord injury community. He stated most of his \npain came from muscle fatigue, usually in his back. He has no feeling in his legs, but \ndoes experience \u201ca lot of muscle spasms\u201d and found that marijuana relaxed his back \nmuscles and spasms. See discussion, infra. (Tr. 21-23, 44-45) \nApplicant still experiences pain, but it is not as severe as it once was and over \nthe years he has developed a certain degree of tolerance. He initially tried over the \ncounter medications such as ibuprofen and later marijuana. Today, he does not take \nanything for his pain except ibuprofen occasionally. Since April 2019, he has not used \nmarijuana and has no intention of using it in the future. (Tr. 25, 46-47, 53) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant self-reported marijuana use on his April 25, 2019 SF-86. (GE 1) He \nwas subsequently interviewed on June 12, 2019, by an Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) investigator regarding his marijuana use. (GE 3) He elaborated on \nhis marijuana use in his January 3, 2021 SOR Answer as well as during his testimony. \nThe following summarizes that marijuana use. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout March 2004 to about April 2019. He admitted this allegation with explanations. \n(SOR Answer) He first used marijuana in 2004, at age 19, on two separate occasions \nwhile in college. A college friend \u201coffered\u201d the marijuana to him on these two occasions, \nboth of which predate his paralysis. He did not use marijuana after these two occasions \nbecause he \u201cdid not particularly enjoy it.\u201d (Tr. 26-28, 40, 56) \nApplicant did not use marijuana again until 2011, after receiving his first medical \nmarijuana card. He did so with \u201cvarying frequency\u201d to address his chronic back pain and \nmuscle spasms relating to his paralysis. (SOR Answer; Tr. 21-23, 26, 45, 56-57) His \nmarijuana usage beginning in 2011, \u201cwould have been on average once to twice a week \nas needed.\u201d He added, \u201cBut, like I said, that would be on average. But then there were \nwould also be periods or weeks, many weeks in between where I wouldn\u2019t have any.\u201d \nThere were times when he did not use marijuana for months or years at a time.  (Tr. 27-\n28, 48-49, 54, 56; GE  3) When Applicant used marijuana, it was typically at home or, if \nwith other individuals, it was within the wheelchair basketball community at \ntournaments. (Tr. 47-48, 54-55) \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision to completely stop using marijuana \u201cwas more of like a \nphasing out.\u201d He added that a side effect of marijuana use was dehydration. As a spinal \ncord injury patient, he found it necessary to avoid dehydration, which could lead to \nbladder infections. Through exercise and a disciplined diet, he used marijuana less and \nwas able to mitigate the need for its use. (Tr. 33-34, 49-50, 54, 57-58) He had started to \nreduce his marijuana use before he filled out his SF-86 in April 2019.

(SOR \nAnswer) He did not purchase marijuana in 2004, but rather a friend in college offered it \nto him on two separate occasions. The first time he purchased marijuana was after he \nreceived his first medical marijuana card in 2011 from a medical marijuana dispensary. \nHe never purchased marijuana \u201coff the streets.\u201d (SOR Answer; Tr. 23-24, 28) \nApplicant\u2019s medical marijuana card expired in 2018. He has not renewed it nor does he \nhave any intention of doing so. (Tr. 24; AE J) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant used and purchased marijuana with varying \nfrequency, from about April 2009 to about April 2019, while granted access to classified \ninformation. He admitted this allegation. See discussion under SOR \u00b6 1.a supra. (Tr. 26-\n27)  \nApplicant purchased marijuana for pain management only at marijuana \ndispensaries. Applicant did not share with his employer his use of marijuana for pain \nmanagement stating, \u201csome people probably would have been okay with it . . . others . . \n. may have some objections to it.\u201d Applicant did not discuss his pain management \nissues with management primarily because he considered it a personal issue and \ndesired to maintain professionalism in the work place. (Tr. 29-31, 56-57) \nIf his clearance is renewed, Applicant stated that he would continue to abstain \nfrom all drugs in the future to include marijuana. (Tr. 35) Applicant takes his job and \nsecurity \u201cvery seriously\u201d and stated that he is not a threat to national security. He is \ntrusted by his coworkers, management, and customers and has received promotions for \nhis work in support of the national defense. (Tr. 34) \nApplicant has not used marijuana since April 2019. (Tr. 53) He does not \nassociate with anyone who uses marijuana. (Tr. 60) Applicant submitted a signed, \nsworn, statement of intent, dated June 15, 2021, to avoid any future drug use or other \nillegal drugs both presently and in the future, with the understanding that any drug \nviolation will result in the. automatic revocation of clearance. (Tr. 25-26; AE H) Post-\nhearing, Applicant submitted a negative drug test dated June 30, 2021. (AE L) \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his March 31, 2009 SF-86 and \ndeliberately failed to disclose his past marijuana use when he answered \u201cno\u201d to the \nquestion whether he had illegally used any controlled substance in the last seven years. \nApplicant admitted this allegation with explanations. (SOR Answer)  \nApplicant stated he \u201cregretfully\u201d failed to disclose his 2004 two-time college \nmarijuana use.

(SOR Answer) When Applicant completed his 2009 SF-86, it \nwas his first job out of college and he \u201cfelt like it was negligible enough to dismiss . . . \nper [his] judgement at the time.\u201d This was also the first time he applied for a security \nclearance. (Tr. 31-32, 40-41) \nApplicant stated that since 2009, he has matured and grown, and now strives to \nbe a responsible citizen, human being, brother, son, and coworker. He disclosed his \n2004 two-time marijuana use in the interest of honesty, peace of mind, and peace of \nconscience.

(Tr. 37; AE G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) Any substance abuse (see above definition); \n(b) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThese proceedings were initiated after Applicant self-reported his marijuana use \non his April 25, 2019 SF-86, and later during his June 12, 2019 OPM interview. These \nself-disclosures establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f). Further review is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists two conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find application of the \nmitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) to be \nappropriate and mitigating. \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows, \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing.

For the \nrecency analysis, the Appeal Board stated: \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use was in April 2019, about 26 months before his \nJune 2021 hearing. Apart from his two-time use of marijuana use in 2004, he did not \nuse marijuana again until 2011. From 2011 to 2019, he used marijuana with varying \nfrequency, a period of eight years. His marijuana use during those eight years was not \non a regular basis, but rather on an as needed basis; once or twice a week, and \nsometimes he went months without using marijuana. His reason for using marijuana \nwas to mitigate pain and muscle spasms following his 2005 ATV accident that left him \npermanently paralyzed. Applicant explained that he did not want to use opioids for \nlogical and credible reasons. Applicant\u2019s two-time experimental use of marijuana as a \n19-year-old college student in 2004 occurred 17 years ago and is of limited security \nsignificance, since it predates his paralysis. \nUsing marijuana while holding a clearance is arguably of the most concern in this \ncase. Applicant explained his decision to use marijuana with varying frequency came \nabout after learning of pain mitigation success stories from members of the spinal cord \ninjury community. Applicant was in an unenviable position of trying to cope with an \nunfortunate situation. As time evolved, Applicant made significant lifestyle changes \nthrough diet, exercise, and moving geographically closer to his family. He credits his \nfamily as being his primary support system. His testimony and photographs with his \nfamily corroborate that assertion. \nThe record contains persuasive evidence that Applicant has turned the corner on \nachieving drug abstinence. He recognizes the importance of being a responsible family \nmember and employee, and that his actions can affect others. He also fully recognizes \nthat there is no room for any drug use while holding a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nself-reflection, moving closer to his family, change in behavior, and support from his \nfamily, friends, and associates, in addition to his 26 months of sobriety, are indicative of \nan individual who wants to right his course. The absence of evidence of more recent or \nextensive drug use, and his promise not to use illegal drugs in the future, eliminates \ndoubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to \nabstaining from illegal drug use. In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd.

Applicant has engaged in a significant amount of self-\nreflection regarding his behavior, and recognizes that such behavior is incompatible with \nholding a security clearance. Applicant has committed to disassociation from drug-using \nassociates and contacts, and avoiding any environment where drugs are used. He \nproduced a June 26, 2021 drug test stating that he was drug-free. He has not renewed \nhis medical marijuana card, which expired in 2018, and has no intention of doing so. \nLastly, he provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s reference letters document that he is an individual who possesses \ncharacter and integrity. Applicant\u2019s work performance evaluations reflect the caliber of \nthe contribution he is making as an employee. His performance further reflects his work \nbehavior is not indicative of someone with a drug problem. As an employee, he is \nviewed as reliable, a constant learner, and an individual with integrity. At his hearing, \nApplicant acknowledged that future drug abuse is incompatible with his future career \nand family plans, and manifested a steadfast commitment to continue lifestyle changes \nconsistent with total abstinence of involvement with all other illegal drugs. \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility, I did so after assessing his demeanor, overall \ncandor on other matters, and reputation among his superiors and peers. Given the \ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s background, his explanation for his actions, and his \nsubsequent actions, I find credible his assertion that he will not use any illegal \nsubstance in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), 26(b)(3) apply. Drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nIn his March 2009 SF-86, Applicant stated \u201cno\u201d when queried whether in the last \nseven years had he used any illegal drugs. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies because he provided a \ndeliberately false answer about his past marijuana use.

Sept. 24, 2013), the Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability \nof mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in [ \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \nEnclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nMy credibility assessment of Applicant discussed under Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Abuse, supra, is applicable under this section. Applicant stated that he \nincorrectly opined that his two-time experimental college marijuana uses in 2004 was \ninsignificant and not worth mentioning given the fact that he had not used marijuana \nbetween 2004 and 2009, when he filled out his first SF-86. He acknowledged that this \nwas a judgment that he should not have made. He fully disclosed his marijuana use in \nhis April 2019 SF-86, during his June 2019 OPM interview, in his January 2021 SOR \nAnswer, and during his June 2021 hearing testimony. In addition to his explanation, I \nhave taken into account his age at the time he completed this SF-86, that it was his first \njob out of college, and the length of time elapsed from the time he completed his first \nSF-86 in 2009 to 2021, a period of almost 13 years. He no longer uses marijuana and \nno longer associates with anyone who uses marijuana. See discussion supra. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(a), 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) to be appropriate and mitigating. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guidelines H and E is \nincorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant has been and is willing to maintain the conduct expected of one \nentrusted with a security clearance. I note that Applicant has overcome significant \nobstacles in arriving where he is today. After being accepted into one of the most \nprestigious engineering colleges in the United States, he sustained a life-changing injury \nbetween his sophomore and junior years that left him permanently paralyzed and wheel \nchair bound. He returned to that same college when able and graduated with a bachelor \nof science degree in aerospace engineering in 2008. In 2009, he began what remains a \nvery successful career with a major defense contractor where he is employed as a \nsenior principal aeronautical engineer. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant self-reported his drug use on his most recent SF-86 knowing that such \ndisclosure could jeopardize his clearance eligibility. His recognizes that his choice to use \nmarijuana to mitigate his pain was contrary to DOD regulations. He did so in a state \nwhere such marijuana use was legal and commonplace, especially within the spinal cord \ninjury community. His explanation regarding his past marijuana use is more thoroughly \naddressed supra. Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred in April 2019, 26 months \nago, is demonstrative of committed sobriety. His lifestyle changes since he stopped \nusing marijuana are significant and noteworthy. \nApplicant\u2019s employer, friends, and family support him. He has a history of stable \nemployment and a strong work ethic. This level of support and self-introspection should \nensure his continued success. His elderly parents and youngest brother rely on him for \nfinancial support. Applicant demonstrated the correct attitude and commitment to \nremaining drug free. He has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and \ntrustworthy person. He was serious, candid, and credible at his hearing. He cooperated \nfully and provided truthful information during all phases of the security clearance \nprocess. He made a favorable impression on me during the hearing. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. National security eligibility is \ngranted. \nRobert Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

The case was assigned to me on \nApril 25, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing \non May 11, 2022, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on July 8, 2022.

He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Systems Engineer. He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has six delinquent debts owed to creditors on \naccounts that were placed for collection, past due, or foreclosed upon, totaling in excess \nof $140,000. In his answer, Applicant denies allegations 1.a., and 1.b. He admits the \nremaining allegations with explanations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the \nApplicant dated April 20, 2018; November 18, 2019; December 7, 2020; and April 18, \n2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6.) \nApplicant began working for his current employer in March 2021, but has over 40 \nyears of experience in the defense industry. He has had no noted interruptions in his \nemployment. \nApplicant is an excellent employee, and is well-respected in the \nworkplace. He lives in a property he purchased in 2000.  (Government Exhibit 7.) \nIn 2008, during a real estate market downturn, Applicant decided to become a \nreal estate investor in his spare time. Relying on suggestions from acquaintances, he \npurchased a number of rental properties with hopes of making a good investment. \nThings have not turned out favorably for him. He has made connections and aligned \nhimself with people who engage in scandalous schemes to obtain loan modifications, \nwithout following standard business practices. Applicant has naively tried to make his \nway, without proper guidance, through the volatile and highly risky real estate market. \nHis exposure to non-licensed financial advisors has not been helpful. Applicant\u2019s lack of \nsound training in real estate principles, coupled with ill-advised real estate investments, \nhas been telling. \n1.a.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $1,903.  Applicant stated that he hired a credit repair \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompany to assist him in resolving his debts. He learned from them that this debt was \nfor a security system that he installed at one of his rental properties. Applicant stated \nthat he has never asked for a consultation, or quote, or ordered a security system to be \ninstalled, and knew nothing about the debt. The creditor informed Applicant that they \nhad proof that someone had ordered the system online from a computer, and that the IP \naddress could be traced back to him. Applicant negotiated a settlement, and paid the \ndebt off. The debt was removed from his credit report. The debt is no longer owing. \nThis allegation is found for the Applicant. (Tr. p. 31-33, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D and \nE.) \n1.b.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $631.  Applicant learned from the credit repair company that \nthis debt was for a year membership at a gym.  Applicant claimed that he went to this \ngym several times using his credit card, but never signed up for a year-long \nmembership.  The credit repair company informed Applicant that they have removed the \ndebt from his credit report.  The debt is no longer owing.  This allegation is found for the \nApplicant.  (Tr. p. 34-35, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits F, G, and H.)   \n1.c.   Applicant is indebted to a bank on a home equity line of credit (HELOC) account \nthat was past-due in the approximate amount of $46,813, with a total balance of \napproximately $145,602.  Applicant testified that he opened a line of credit in 2010, \nagainst (property #5), a property he owned free and clear since the 1990\u2019s.  Applicant \nenlisted his gentleman friend\u2019s advice, and stopped paying on the loan, to force a loan \nmodification.  Since Applicant\u2019s original loan payment was interest only, he wanted a \nbetter loan.  Applicant followed the advice of his friend.  Applicant stated that he \nstopped paying on the loan in 2015.  Applicant\u2019s stated that he last contacted the \ncreditor in 2016 or 2017.  He also stated that he planned to sell the property to resolve \nthe HELOC.  (Tr. p. 111.)  It was only after receiving the SOR that Applicant made \narrangements to sell the property.  Documentation shows that Applicant sold property \n#5 for $279,000, and closed escrow on February 15, 2022, just seven months ago. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit U.)  A letter from the real estate agent who sold property #5 states \nthat Applicant settled the lien on the property with the proceeds from the sale. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit AA.)  A copy of an email from a bank dated February 16, 2022, \nindicates that a mortgage loan was paid off in full as of that date.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nV.)  It appears that the HELOC is no longer owing.  This allegation is found for the \nApplicant.       \nThe next section of this decision is generally related to allegations 1.d., 1.e., and \n1.f. In 2008, a female friend of the Applicant, (Applicant was dating her sister at the \ntime), told Applicant about the opportunity to purchase inexpensive out-of-state rental \nproperty, with tenants and a property manager already in line.  Applicant\u2019s female friend \nput Applicant in touch with her contact who was allegedly trying to find investors.  \nApplicant spoke to the contact on the telephone and he remembers meeting him at his \noffice.  Applicant stated that he does not remember that a down payment was required, \nbut the way the package was pitched, he paid $2,000 to buy the package, and then \nsigned the papers, and ended up owning the property, deed, and all.  (Tr. pp. 43-44.)

He \npurchased three of these out-of-state homes, and became an instant landlord. \nApplicant knew very little about real estate investing or management and was not \nprepared for what happened next. He never personally saw the property he purchased. \nHe never inspected the neighborhood, or met the tenants. He never reviewed the \ntenants credit history, nor did he ever meet the property manager. Applicant relied \nheavily on what his female friend told him. He was very na\u00efve and never contemplated \nthe risks involved in taking on the management and responsibility of being a landlord for \nout-of-state property. \nIn 2008, the real estate market crashed. His tenants stopped paying the rent. \nHis property manager quit. \nThere was also some vandalism, squatters, and a \nbasement flood when a water heater gave out. Applicant was left without help, and did \nnot know what to do so. \nAgain, relying on advice from his female friend, Applicant attended a real estate \nseminar where he met two gentlemen, who soon became his friends.  They told him that \nthey could help him with his out-of-state properties. These men were not licensed \nbusiness advisors. \nHowever, for some unknown reason, Applicant trusted them \nexplicitly, and accepted their help. One of the gentlemen advised Applicant of his \n\u201cmethodology\u201d to obtain a loan modification. He told the Applicant to stop making the \nmortgage payments on the properties, and to default on the loans. This situation would \nforce the bank to negotiate with the Applicant in refinancing the loans, and to obtain a \nmore affordable monthly payment. \nApplicant paid these gentlemen two or three \nthousand dollars for their advice, and followed it. In 2013, all three properties were \nforeclosed upon. \n1.d.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor on a mortgage account (property #\n 1) that went \ninto foreclosure in 2013.  There is some vague evidence that Applicant may have \nattempted to sell the property, but he ultimately \u201cwalked away\u201d from his contractual \nobligation.

There is some vague evidence that Applicant may have \nattempted to sell the property, but he ultimately \u201cwalked away\u201d from his contractual \nobligation.  A notice of Sheriff\u2019s sale was filed on July 11, 2013.  A final judgment \namount of $55,669.21 was recorded.  (Government Exhibit 11.)  There is no \ndocumentation to confirm that Applicant is fully released from his obligation to the \nlender. \nApplicant has never indicated that he did not have sufficient monies available to \nhim to pay his delinquent debts, pay the mortgages, or to support his investments. He \nwas asked why he did not simply pay off the debt on the out-of-state homes. Applicant \nstated that at the time he defaulted on the loans, he owed about $40,000 on each \nhome. He thought that because the value of a home had decreased to only $1,000 to \n$2,000, he did not want to pay off the debt. So he walked away.  (Tr. p. 59-60.) \nDespite the fact that he was not successful with his out-of-state investment \nproperties, Applicant continued to purchase more properties. About 2008, Applicant \npurchased (property #4.) (Government Exhibit 8.) This was a vacation rental property \nthat Applicant believed needed some fixing and a swimming pool. Someone suggested \nto him that he could use it as his own vacation property when it was not rented. \nApplicant found this appealing. \nApplicant enlisted the help of the same gentleman he \nhad used earlier, his friend, the unlicensed business advisor, to help him obtain a better \nloan. Again, the gentlemen advised Applicant to stop paying the mortgage on the \nproperty to try to get a better loan. (Tr. p. 38.) \nIn June 2012, Applicant co-signed with his friend to purchase (property #6), a \nmulti-unit apartment complex. In November 2012, Applicant purchased (property #7), a \nsecond vacation rental located in the same city where (property #4), the first vacation \nrental is located. These new investments occurred about the same time Applicant had \nstopped making payments on the out-of-state properties #1, #2, and #3, that were going \nthrough foreclosure. \nAs time passed, Applicant continued to enlist the services of his gentlemen \nfriend, the unlicensed financial advisor, for further real estate investment advice. As \npart of his friend\u2019s strategy to obtain a load modification, Applicant was instructed to file \na number of identity theft reports through the credit agencies saying that some of the \nmortgage accounts recorded under his name were not his, when in fact, Applicant knew \nthat they were his mortgage accounts. (Tr. p. 90-93.) Applicant followed this advice. In \n2014, Applicant stopped paying the mortgages on his primary residence (property #8), \non his rental investment, (property #4) and on his home equity line of credit associated \nwith (property #5.) Applicant was successful in obtaining the mortgage modifications on \nhis primary residence, (property #8) and on his vacation (property #4.) He did not \nobtain the loan modification for the line of credit associated with (property #5.) As \ndiscussed above, when Applicant sold (property #5), last year, he states that he paid off \nthe HELOC with the proceeds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nIn 2019, less than three years ago, Applicant purchased another (property #9), \nwhich consists of two land parcels he plans to develop into a 13-unit subdivision with a \npartner. (Government Exhibit 16, and Tr. pp. 106, 115.) Applicant explained that he \nbought the parcels for $350,000. \nHe obtained a hard money loan to make the \npurchase, at 13 percent interest, and he has a monthly payment of about $3,700. (Tr. \npp. 116-117.) \nA close review of Applicant\u2019s financial statement is misleading and \ninaccurate, as it does not show that Applicant is responsible for the entire loan payment. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N.) \nBefore he became an active real estate investor, Applicant purchased (property \n#5), in the 1980\u2019s that he finished paying off in the 1990\u2019s. This property Applicant \npurchased for his parents. Applicant\u2019s parents have since passed away.  In about 2010, \nApplicant placed a HELOC on the property, a line of credit. Applicant used the money \nfrom the HELOC to fix up (property #4), specifically, to install a swimming pool. \nApplicant stated that he has stopped enlisting the help of his unlicensed financial \nadvisor because he now has all of the loan modifications that he needs. (Tr. p. 77.) \nApplicant continues to associate with his acquaintances and friends he has met and \nworked with through his real estate deals that have provided him with advice. He stated \nthat he is current with all of his regular monthly expenses, and has no other delinquent \ndebt. However, he does not follow a financial budget. (Tr. p. 123.) He currently \ngrosses about $10,000 a month from his employer. He also has a company retirement \nplan and other savings. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits W, X and Y.) After paying his regular \nmonthly expenses Applicant states that he has money left over for discretionary \nexpenses. He believes that his financial situation is under control.  \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \n2.a.  In 2015, Applicant obtained a mortgage modification with an application that falsely \nstated that he lived in the property securing the mortgage, or that he had lived there \nprior to being displaced.  This was not true.  (Tr. pp. 67-68.)  The property for which the \nApplicant was obtaining a loan modification was not the Applicant\u2019s primary residence.  \nApplicant stated that he was unaware of what he was signing when he completed the \napplication.  He contends that he didn\u2019t intend to defraud anyone, and was relying on \nhis friend\u2019s advice.  Applicant\u2019s explanation in not credible.  Applicant knew exactly what \nhe was doing when he signed the paperwork.  His purpose was to obtain a loan \nmodification and in order to obtain it, he needed to represent that he resided in the \nproperty, or the property would be considered an investment property, and the interest \nrate on the loan would automatically be higher.  Applicant also admitted that he had filed \na number of identity theft reports through the credit agencies saying that some of his \nmortgage accounts were not his, when in fact they were his mortgage accounts, in order \nto accomplish this loan modification.  This is fraudulent.  Applicant\u2019s belief that this \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nconduct is or was acceptable holds no merit. To trust an unlicensed financial advisor\u2019s \nmethodology to help him obtain his loan modification shows poor judgment and \nunreliability. (Tr. pp. 89-92.) \n2.b.  Applicant completed a security clearance application dated March 23, 2018.  In \nresponse to Section 26, Delinquency Involving Enforcement Other than previously \nlisted, Applicant was asked, \u201cIn the last seven years, have you had a judgment entered \nagainst you?\u201d  Section 26, Financial Record Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts, \nOther than previously listed, asked, \u201cIn the last seven years, have you had any \npossessions or property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or foreclosed? . . . In \nthe past seven years, have you defaulted on any type of loan?\u201d   Section 28, Non-\nCriminal Court Actions, asked \u201cIn the last ten years have you been a party to any public \nrecord civil court action not listed elsewhere on this form?\u201d   Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d, to \nall three questions.  Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his HELOC, and his past- \ndue indebtedness, and his three foreclosures as set forth in subparagraphs 1.d., \nthrough 1.f.   \nApplicant\u2019s excuse for not being truthful was that he was not familiar with the \nterms of the questions that were being asked. He stated that he did not think to ask \nanyone for help, as his mind is pretty proprietary. He stated that he was not trying to \nhide anything from the Government. (Tr. pp. 70-71.) I do not find this explanation \ncredible. \nApplicant is an intelligent, well-educated engineer, who has worked for \ndefense contractors for over 40 years. He is expected to understand the questions on \nthe application. If the questions are complicated or too confusing to the Applicant, than \nsafeguarding classified information would be much too difficult for him. Applicant was \nconsistent in answering each of the three questions in the negative. He knew or should \nhave known how to read and understand the fairly simple questions on the application, \nand he should have been truthful in answering them. \nInstead, Applicant deliberately lied in response to the questions noted above on \nhis security clearance application. \nWithin seven years of the application, he had \nallowed three of his out-of-state properties to go into foreclosure, he had strategically \ndefaulted on his mortgage for his primary residence, strategically defaulted on a \nvacation home, and was delinquent on a line of credit owed to a bank. \nIt is \nincomprehensible how his responses to the questions can be explained any other way. \nIt is clear that he was deliberately not candid or truthful in his responses on the \napplication. \nHis conduct is unacceptable and not tolerated by the Department of \nDefense. \nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant for the period from 2009 through 2012, \nare highly favorable. They reflect ratings of \u201cexceeds\u201d or \u201cfar exceeds\u201d job requirements \nin every category.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit Q.) \nSeveral letters of recommendation submitted on Applicant\u2019s behalf attest to \nApplicant\u2019s good character. He is known to be diligent and conscientious at work, and \nconsidered trustworthy and honest. \nHis is recommended for a security clearance. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits R, S, and AA.) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThree witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. Two of these individuals know \nnothing about Applicant\u2019s finances or real estate matters and had limited understanding \nof the allegations in the SOR. An Aerospace Engineer, who is a coworker of the \nApplicant, and who has known him since 1992, stated that Applicant is trustworthy, and \ncan always be counted on. (Tr. pp. 131-136.) A real estate and mortgage broker, who \nhelped the Applicant sell property #5, who also knows Applicant\u2019s friend, the unlicensed \nfinancial advisor, testified that in his opinion, the advisor is not doing good business. He \nknows that the man does not follow standard business practices, and is known to rip \npeople off. He wants nothing to do with the man who he says has committed multiple \nfrauds, and is a fraudster. (Tr. pp. 139-143.) A retired co-worker, who also submitted a \nletter on Applicant\u2019s behalf, testified that Applicant is a wonderful colleague. He has \ndinner with Applicant on occasion. He states that Applicant is a nice person. He has \nnever observed the Applicant do anything against security policy. (Tr. pp. 145-148.) \nEach of the witnesses recommend Applicant for a security clearance. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe 2008 real estate market crash contributed to Applicant\u2019s failed real estate \ninvestments. \nHowever, since then, Applicant has not demonstrated a pattern of \nreasonable and responsible conduct. He has aligned himself with people who do not \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfollow standard business practices, and use scandalous methods to obtain loan \nmodifications. Applicant has followed their advice a number of times and obtained loan \nmodifications this way. \nApplicant has gone to great extents to avoid fulfilling his \ncontractual obligations in his mortgage contracts by defaulting on three properties, has \nfailed to make payments on his home equity line of credit, and has obtained loan \nmodifications in unscrupulous ways. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nReal estate is a risky business. Applicant assumed the risk when he invested in \nthe out-of-state properties without any proper training or experience in the real estate \nmarket. He purchased three properties intending to make money on his investment. \nWhen the housing market crashed, and his investment went \u201csouth,\u201d he found a way to \navoid the issue. He did not want to bear the burden of the decreased value of the \nproperties, and so he defaulted on his contractual obligations and allowed the banks to \nassume the loss. He defaulting on three mortgage loans, and a line of credit. Instead \nof immediately getting out of the market, like a prudent person would do after such a \ndevastating experience, he continued to invest and purchased more properties. He also \ncontinued to rely on the same people who advised him wrongly in the first place. By \nscrutinizing the timeline, Applicant was actually purchasing more properties while the \nout-of-state properties were going into foreclosure. His conduct was reckless, na\u00efve, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nand dangerous. He was using scandalous tactics to obtain loan modifications to avoid \nconventional mortgage rates. Applicant has always had sufficient financial resources \navailable to him to pay his mortgages, but chose to allow them to go into foreclosure. \nFurthermore, waiting until he received the SOR, before he sold a property to pay off the \nlien that was placed on a home equity line of credit he defaulted on, also shows \nirresponsibility. Applicant\u2019s conduct has been unprofessional and scandalous. He has \nshown poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness. \nNone of the mitigating \nconditions apply. This guideline is found against the Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process \nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a while, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but it not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by for foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant obtained a mortgage modification with an application that falsely stated \nthat he lived in the property or had lived there prior to being displaced. This was not \ntrue. Applicant did not live in the property, and in fact obtained the modification for an \ninvestment property he owned. Applicant also deliberately concealed his derogatory \nfinancial history on his security clearance application. There is no excuse for this \ndishonesty. Deliberately concealing material information from the government on a \nsecurity clearance application raises serious questions about one\u2019s credibility and \ntrustworthiness. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. This guideline is \nfound against the Applicant. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate \nuntruthful responses on the mortgage modification application, as well as on the \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \nshows \npoor \njudgment, \nunreliability, \nand \nuntrustworthiness. In addition, there is evidence of unscrupulous conduct by the \nApplicant, not alleged in the SOR, but directly related to his credibility, that has been \nconsidered in this case. Relying on the advice of an unlicensed financial advisor, with \nno legitimate basis to dispute them, Applicant submitted a number of fraudulent identity \ndisputes to the credit bureaus and/or to the banks to contest mortgage accounts that he \nknew were his own. These are outrageous, scandalous schemes that demonstrate a \npattern of misrepresentations. Considered in totality, Applicant has not shown the \nrequisite good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, required for eligibility to access \nclassified information. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations and Personal Conduct security concerns. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a., and 2.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

(Tr.17-18; Gov 1; AE G, AE H) \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations:  \nOn October 29, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance questionnaire. A \nsubsequent security clearance background investigation revealed Applicant had the \nfollowing delinquent debts: a $13,098 charged-off debt as a result of a voluntary car \nrepossession (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 5); a $7,807 \ndelinquent medical account owed to an unidentified medical creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 4 \nat 2; Gov 5 at 5); a $1,286 delinquent medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at \n5 ?); a $749 delinquent medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 5); a $609 \ndelinquent account that was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 5); a \n$596 delinquent medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 4 at 2); and a $575 delinquent \naccount that was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 4 at 2). \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to file her Federal income tax returns \nfor tax year 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); failed to file her State A income tax returns for tax year \n2017 (SOR \u00b61.i); and failed to file her State B income tax returns for tax year 2017 \n(SOR \u00b61.j). (Gov 2 at 4, 7) \nApplicant faced many personal and financial issues in 2017. Her grandmother \nand uncle became seriously ill.

She was unaware that she was required to file state \nincome tax returns for both State A and State B. She was required to do this because \nshe lived part of the year in State A and part of the year in State B. When she \ndiscovered this was an issue, Applicant attempted to resolve the situation.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR alleges an automobile \ndebt, two consumer debts, and four medical debts. Applicant also failed to file her state \nand federal income tax returns in 2017. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and AG 19(f) apply. \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in her obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government.

The following mitigating conditions potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Applicant suffered several medical complications resulting in \nunplanned medical bills. In 2017, Applicant\u2019s father, grandmother, and uncle became ill \nand passed away. She contributed to their care and paid her father\u2019s funeral expenses. \nThe automobile debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, was also a circumstance beyond her control. \nHer car was totaled in an accident. She thought the insurance company would pay the \ndebt. They denied the claim. Applicant is doing the best she can under the \ncircumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies. Applicant made a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent \ndebts. Applicant resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g. She entered into \npayments plans for the automobile debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and the state tax debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence to show that she was paying the \ndelinquent medical debts. While the SOR pleading was so vague that Applicant could \nnot identify the name of the creditor, she took it upon herself to contact every medical \nfacility where she received treatment. She discovered no collectable medical debts. \nThere are no delinquent medical debts listed in the most recent credit report, obtained in \nSeptember 2022. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies because Applicant filed all of her 2017 state and federal \nincome tax returns in 2019. She received a refund from the federal government and \nowed no money to State A. She entered into a repayment plan with State B. \nWhile the September 2022 credit report listed two new delinquent debts, \nApplicant\u2019s explanation that she prioritized paying her lawyer to represent her in the \nsecurity clearance proceeding is understandable. She intends to pay the delinquency as \nsoon as she can. She currently lives within her means. She is making every effort that \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis within her control to resolve her accounts. Applicant mitigated the security concerns \nraised under Financial Considerations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence \nof actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant \nis not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

I considered Applicant\u2019s past \nfinancial issues as well as her efforts towards resolving her delinquent debt. She \naddressed and is addressing the delinquent debts that she was able to resolve. While \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is not perfect, she has taken steps to improve her financial \nsituation. Her income has increased and she occasionally works part time to \nsupplement her income. Several of Applicant\u2019s debts were caused by circumstances \nbeyond her control. She has taken significant steps to resolve her delinquent debt and \nhas a plan in place to continue to resolve her debts. For these reasons, security \nconcerns raised under the Financial Considerations Guideline are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nWITHDRAWN \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

At that time, he also began selling marijuana. He \nsold and distributed marijuana during his sophomore and junior years. He made a \nmonetary profit by selling marijuana and obtained it free for his own personal use. During \nhis senior year of college, he was asked to leave his fraternity because of his drug use. \nHis drug supplier was arrested for trafficking, and he lost that source of marijuana for \nhimself. He found a new source and continued to buy marijuana so that he could use it \non a daily basis throughout his senior year. Applicant continued his marijuana use through \n2016 when he obtained a security clearance. He has used marijuana \u201cseveral hundred \ntimes.\u201d He claims his last use of marijuana was in June 2018. He ate a marijuana-laced \nchocolate bar. When reporting his use in his July 2019 SCA, he claimed he \u201caccidentally\u201d \nate the marijuana-laced chocolate bar. In his later February 2020 background interview, \nhe told the investigator that he intentionally and knowingly ate the chocolate bar. He held \na security clearance at the time of this knowing use of marijuana. Without specifying what \ndrug it was, Applicant testified that his last use of illegal drugs was on December 31, 2018. \nHe deliberately failed to list his illegal marijuana use on his September 2015 SCA because \nhe believed that if he answered truthfully he would not receive a security clearance.

He did not have a legal prescription for Adderall and Trazodone \nat the time he used them. He purchased the drugs from someone who had a prescription. \nHe purchased the methamphetamines he used from an unknown source. The cocaine he \nused was either given to him by friends or his girlfriend (now wife) purchased it for their \nuse. He deliberately failed to list his pre-2015 drug use and prescription drug abuse on \nhis 2015 SCA. He used all these drugs when he held a security clearance. Applicant \nbelieved that even though he held a clearance at the time of his uses, he did not yet have \naccess to any cleared information so he did not think there was a problem. He did not \nreveal his overall drug history to his current employer until after his security clearance \nhearing. (Tr. 29; GE 1-3; AE J-K) \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately gave false information on both his 2015 and \n2019 SCAs when he stated that alcohol was not involved when he was ordered to seek \nalcohol counseling by the court as a result of his 2013 arrest. (Tr. 34-35; GE 1-2) \nApplicant has not participated in any drug counseling. He was court-ordered to \nattend alcohol counseling related to his 2013 and 2014 arrests.

(Tr. 24, 28, 37-39; GE 1, 3; AE A-I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaw (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.   \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s frequent use, possession, and purchase of marijuana, cocaine, \nmethamphetamines, Adderall, and Trazadone between 2008 and 2019 is supported by \nhis admissions and other evidence. He distributed marijuana over a two-year period while \nattending college. He used all the above drugs after being granted a security clearance \nin 2016. I find all the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nApplicant used multiple illegal drugs and abused prescription drugs on hundreds \nof occasions between 2008 and 2019. Given his pattern of use, his claimed abstinence \nbeginning in 2019 is not sufficient to overcome his prolonged drug use. Although he stated \nthat he did not intend to use any drugs in the future, he did not provide a signed statement \nof intent to abstain from all future illegal drug use. He also admitted that his wife still uses \nmarijuana and cocaine, so he has not disassociated himself from other drug users. \nApplicant\u2019s claimed abstinence is insufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. \nThe frequency and recency of his past use, and his uses while holding a security \nclearance, cast doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and AG 26(b) do not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country; and \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while legal \nthere, is illegal in the United States; security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately provided false information on both his 2015 \nand 2019 SCAs because he believed that if he told the truth about his drug history and \nhis alcohol use relative to his 2013 arrest, he would be denied a security clearance. AG \n\u00b6 16(a) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s use of five different drugs after he was granted a security clearance \nand his failure to disclose to his employer his drug history causes significant concern. \nAdditionally, his most recent false SCA in 2019 shows that he has not learned from his \npast transgressions. His poor judgment was also apparent when he admitted that his wife \nstill uses cocaine and marijuana despite having an infant child in the home. Cumulatively, \nall these actions raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nBased upon the general personal conduct security concern, AG \u00b6 15, and AG \u00b6 16(e) are \nraised by the evidence. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant did not disclose his drug history until completing his 2019 SCA, four \nyears after he certified his false 2015 SCA. He did not make a prompt, good-faith effort \nto correct his previous falsifications. His extensive use of multiple illegal drugs, as recently \nas 2019, while holding a security clearance, and his poor judgment in passively allowing \nhis wife to use illegal drugs while caring for their infant child casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b617(c) does not apply. Although Applicant claims he \nwill not use illegal drugs or abuse prescription drugs in the future, he has not obtained \ncounseling to help correct his aberrant behavior. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, his work \nappraisals, and his community involvement. However, I also considered Applicant\u2019s long \nhistory of illegal drug use and his continued use after obtaining a security clearance. He \nalso deliberately falsified his two SCAs in order to obtain and retain a security clearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the drug involvement and \npersonal conduct security concerns.  \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines H and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m). Her admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact.

She cohabitated with her \nboyfriend, who is her son\u2019s father, until 2021. She now lives with family to reduce her \nmonthly expenses. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006.

In March 2016, Applicant gave birth to her son eight weeks early. She was on \nmaternity leave for 12 weeks after his birth, and was paid 60 percent of her salary during \nthat time. The baby\u2019s premature birth also created hospital bills for her. Applicant stated \nthat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1m are the medical debts related to his birth that insurance did not cover. \n(Tr. 20-21, 28-30) \nApplicant purchased her home in 2014, and it was foreclosed upon in early 2017. \nAt that time, her boyfriend had agreed to split their household expenses each month. She \nclaimed that he was unable to do so during that two-year period because he was in-\nbetween jobs. The record shows that he was unemployed twice in 2014, for about four \nmonths the first time, and for about a month the second time. He was consistently \nemployed after 2014. She tried to sell the home before foreclosure; however, they had a \nflood in the basement, which prevented a sale. (Tr. 42-44, 50-58; AE H, I) \nIn May 2021, there was a fire in Applicant\u2019s apartment building. Her rental unit and \nbelongings suffered water damage from this incident. She was displaced for most of the \nmonth. Her losses were covered by insurance, and her out-of-pocket expenses were less \nthan $1,000. Before renting another unit, she decided to move-in with her mother to \nreduce her expenses. Since her move, her boyfriend was supposed to provide her with \nfunds for child support, but he has not done so, and she has not taken any action to obtain \nit. (Tr. 33-39, 50-58; AE H) \nIn February 2022, Applicant required treatment and examination at the hospital. \nShe stated that her bills from that event were about $1,042. She asserted that she is \npaying those bills first, before addressing her other delinquent debts. (Tr. 40; AE D) \nIn August 2018, Applicant was asked about twelve of the SOR debts by a \ngovernment investigator. She stated that she was going to request validation of six, and \nasserted that she would contact the creditors to make payment arrangements if the debts \nwere hers.

(Tr. 23, 29-30; GE 6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record, and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s $1,338 of medical debt (\u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.m) originating from her son\u2019s \npremature birth occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. This does not \napply to her $49,662 of consumer debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h). The date of last activity for two of \nthe debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f) precedes her son\u2019s birth and financial problems in 2016. \nApplicant has been consistently employed since 2009. She has only resolved two of the \nSOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g) in the last six years. She has not provided sufficient \ndocumentation showing that the other debts cited in the SOR are being paid (except the \njudgment in \u00b61.a), or have been resolved. Despite her promises to pay, her current budget \nshows that she does not have means to address these debts anytime in the near future. \nPromises to pay, which she has been making since 2018, are not a substitute for a \nmeaningful track record of payments and financial responsibility. Her budget shows that \nshe now has over $20,000 of additional consumer debt. Her failure to pay her charged-\noff and delinquent debts is recent, not isolated, and ongoing. This continues to cast doubt \non her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies to \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.i-1.m, but it does not apply to \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s medical debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.m) \noriginating from her son\u2019s premature birth occurred due to circumstances beyond her \ncontrol. However, she did not provide sufficient documentation showing that she acted \nresponsibly in regard to these debts. There is insufficient evidence to show that her \nconsumer debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h) occurred under circumstances beyond her control, and that \nshe acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g because Applicant resolved these debts in \n2019. It does not apply to \u00b6 1.a because it is a judgment, and the payments are not \nvoluntary. She did not provide sufficient documentation to show that she has undertaken \na good-faith effort to repay or resolve the remaining SOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not \napply to \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013e, and 1.h-1.m. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I also considered her letters of recommendation. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of six of Applicant\u2019s \ncharged-off and delinquent consumer debts under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1.m: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

The Government\u2019s \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 7 are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 48 years old, \nmarried, and he does not have any children. As of his October 2019 security clearance \napplication (SCA), he owned a home in state A since October 2017; he previously \nowned a home in state B from 2007 to October 2017. (Items 1, 2, 3; FORM Response) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1991. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2017. As of his October 2019 SCA, he worked as a developer for his employer, a DOD \ncontractor, since February 2017. He worked for a previous DOD contractor from \nJanuary to June 2015. He was a self-employed consultant from February to August \n2013. He briefly served in the U.S. Army Reserve in 1993 and was medically \ndischarged. He has previously held a security clearance. (Items 3, 7; FORM Response) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 13 delinquent student loans totaling $73,659 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.k, 1.m - 1.n) and a $698 delinquent consumer debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l). In his \nAnswer and during his 2020 background interviews, Applicant acknowledged his \ndelinquent student loans and stated that he was unsure what the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l was \nfor. All of Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loans are listed on his November 2019 credit \nbureau report. The student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.k and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l are \nlisted on his August 2020 credit bureau report. All but one of Applicant\u2019s delinquent \nstudent loans, totaling $72,858, are listed on his April 2021 credit bureau report. \nApplicant also discussed his delinquent student loans during his 2020 background \ninterviews. (Items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nDuring his 2020 background interviews, Applicant attributed his delinquent \nstudent loans to his 2013 period of self-employment. In his Answer and FORM \nResponse, he stated that his student loans remained delinquent because he was \nfinancially supporting his sister-in-law, who was disabled and not yet approved for \ndisability benefits, in addition to his best friend, who had difficulty finding employment \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. In his FORM Response, he stated that his spouse was \ndisabled and required assistance with daily activities, which Applicant, at times, had to \npay for; his home required repair after it was damaged by a tornado in 2019, and he \nwas in the process of appealing his denied insurance claim; and he and his spouse \nspent their savings after Applicant\u2019s security clearance was suspended and he lost his \njob. (Items 2, 7; Form Response) \nApplicant stated in his Answer that he and his spouse had one remaining car \npayment due in January 2021, after which time they would have at their disposal $5,000 \nto apply toward their delinquent debts.

He submitted no evidence \nto show he received financial counseling, is following a budget, or engaged any debt \nconsolidation services. (Items 2, 7; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d apply. Applicant was unable to pay his student loans and \nconsumer debt. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b); however, Applicant must \nprovide evidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. Applicant has not \nprovided documentation to corroborate his claims of payment toward his delinquent \nstudent loans. He did not provide sufficient proof of any efforts he made to resolve his \noutstanding debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 27, 2020, Applicant owed collection debts of $199 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $150 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $884 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $12,995 (SOR \u00b6 1.d, student loan), $3,329 (SOR \u00b6 1.f, student loan), $508 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), $293 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), $258 (SOR \u00b6 1.i), $195 (SOR \u00b6 1.j), and $144 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); and a charged- off debt of $8,246 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, car-loan deficiency). As amended, the SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s father-in-law (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and mother-in-law (SOR \u00b6 2.c) are resident citizens of Jordan. When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, she admitted the collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.d, and 1.f, but stated that they have been paid. She denied the collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h based on payment; the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c for lack of knowledge; the car-loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and an associated debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g because she had returned the vehicle to the dealership within two business days of purchase; and the collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.k on which she had opened dispute inquiries. Applicant acknowledged that her in-laws are resident citizens of Jordan, but she denied any inference that she had divided allegiance. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. 3 Financial Applicant is 39 years old and married.

On May 10, 2021, the Government \nrequested a hearing pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Directive. On June 30, 2021, a DOHA \nDepartment Counsel indicated that the Government was ready to proceed to a hearing. \nOn July 19, 2021, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on \nJuly 26, 2021. \nOn receipt of the case file, I informed Applicant of the option of having a virtual \nhearing online using the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS) system. Applicant did not \nrespond before September 1, 2021, when the DCS was no longer available to DOHA. \nAfter some coordination with the parties, on October 22, 2021, I scheduled an in-person \nhearing for Applicant to be held on December 1, 2021. \nAt the hearing held as scheduled, the Government withdrew Guideline B allegation \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. Eleven Government exhibits (GEs 1 through 11) and five Applicant exhibits \n(AEs A-E) were admitted in evidence without any objections. At the Government\u2019s \nrequest, I indicated that I would accept a Request for Administrative Notice Hashemite \nKingdom of Jordan, dated June 30, 2021, as a hearing exhibit (HE I), subject to any \ncomments or objections by Applicant. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) received on December 9, 2021.1 \nI held the record open after the hearing for two weeks for additional documentation \nfrom Applicant. On December 13, 2021, Applicant submitted seven documents, including \ntwo that were duplicative of AEs A and B. The five documents not duplicative were marked \nfor identification as AEs F through J, and accepted into evidence without any objections \nfrom the Government. The record closed on December 14, 2021, when Department \nCounsel assented to the admission of the post-hearing submissions. \nRuling on Request for Administrative Notice \nAt the hearing, the Government submitted a request for administrative notice \nconcerning the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) dated June 30, 2021. The \nGovernment\u2019s request for administrative notice was based on five publications of the U.S. \nState Department: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2020: Jordan, dated \nMarch 30, 2021; Jordan Travel Advisory, dated April 21, 2021; Jordan 2020 Crime & \nSafety Report, dated May 1, 2020; Jordan International Travel Information, dated April \n1 The index to the transcript is incorrect with regard to witness testimony.

Department \nCounsel provided extracts of the source documents and the URLs where the full \ndocuments could be obtained. Applicant confirmed that she received the Government\u2019s \nrequest for administrative notice with the extracts. \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political \nconditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties that I would take administrative notice of the facts \nrequested by the Government with respect to Jordan, subject to the relevance and \nmateriality of the source documentation, including whether the facts are substantiated by \nreliable government sources, and subject to any valid objections from Applicant. When \nthe issue of administrative notice was discussed, Applicant stated that she should \nrespond to the Government\u2019s request. She did not submit any objections to any of the \nfacts proposed by the Government for administrative notice and did not propose any facts \nfor administrative notice after her hearing. Accordingly, I accept the Government\u2019s \nRequest for Administrative Notice Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for review and \nconsideration as HE I. \nAlso, in accord with my obligation to take note of current conditions in the country \nat issue in a Guideline B case, I reviewed an updated travel advisory from the U.S. State \nDepartment, Jordan Travel Advisory, dated December 6, 2021, and, for background \ninformation regarding relations between Jordan and the United States, I reviewed the \nU.S. State Department\u2019s Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, U.S. Relations with Jordan, dated \nDecember 30, 2020. Both publications were accessed online at www.state.gov. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 27, 2020, Applicant \nowed collection debts of $199 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $150 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $884 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $12,995 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d, student loan), $3,329 (SOR \u00b6 1.f, student loan), $508 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), $293 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h), $258 (SOR \u00b6 1.i), $195 (SOR \u00b6 1.j), and $144 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); and a charged-\noff debt of $8,246 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, car-loan deficiency). As amended, the SOR alleges under \nGuideline B that Applicant\u2019s father-in-law (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and mother-in-law (SOR \u00b6 2.c) are \nresident citizens of Jordan. \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, she admitted the collection debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.d, and 1.f, but stated that they have been paid. She denied the \ncollection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h based on payment; the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c for lack of \nknowledge; the car-loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and an associated debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g because \nshe had returned the vehicle to the dealership within two business days of purchase; and \nthe collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.k on which she had opened dispute inquiries. \nApplicant acknowledged that her in-laws are resident citizens of Jordan, but she denied \nany inference that she had divided allegiance. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nFinancial \nApplicant is 39 years old and married. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree earned in May \n2005. (GE 1.) Between August 2001 and March 2005, Applicant obtained several student \nloans to pay for her undergraduate education. One or more of the credit reports in \nevidence show that Applicant had four student loans totaling $17,250 (accounts starting \nwith #45) that had been transferred by Sallie Mae to the federal government, which was \nreporting a balance of $19,676 as of July 2011. As of July 2011, Sallie Mae was holding \nfour other student loans in collection totaling $15,068 (accounts starting with #96). (GE \n8.) When Applicant went to college, she did not fully understand the system with respect \nto paying for her education. She did not apply for some scholarships for which she was \neligible (Tr. 41), and after paying on her student loans for about four years, she became \n\u201cfrustrated\u201d with the lack of progress in lowering the principal and stopped paying the \nloans. (Tr. 46.) \nWhile Applicant was in college, she had an internship with a defense contractor \nfrom November 2003 to September 2004. (GEs 3, 11.) After she graduated, she worked \nfor the defense contractor as a full-time employee for the next nine years. (GE 1.) \nOn July 27, 2011, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a Questionnaire \nfor National Security Positions (SF 86). She responded affirmatively to financial record \ninquiries concerning whether, in the last seven years, she had defaulted on any loan; had \nan account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay according \nto terms; or had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts; and whether she was \ncurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. She listed a student-loan debt of $8,206 \nand a credit-card debt of $10,573, asserting that they were being repaid under established \nrepayment plans, and a delinquent car loan on which she owed $12,180 for which she \nwas attempting to arrange for repayment. (GE 3.) \nAs of August 23, 2011, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed that she had closed \nseveral credit-card accounts after repaying the debts on time and that she and a joint \nowner had opened a credit-card account in July 2011 (balance $7,506). She reportedly \nowed two medical debts in collection for $106 and $418; credit-card collection debts of \n$4,290, $10,373, and $6,199; $12,180 on the car loan; student-loan collection balances \nof $7,946, $2,059, $2,664, and $2,322; and a charged-off credit-card debt of $6,901. The \nfederal government was owed $19,676 in additional student-loan debts that were in \ndeferment after being seriously past due from September 2010 through May 2011. (GE \n8.) \nOn September 8, 2011, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator \nfor the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). She explained that her Sallie Mae \nstudent loans totaled $14,900 and that she started repaying them in late July 2011 when \nshe made a payment of $600. She explained that she arranged to have $300 a month \nwithdrawn from her bank account for the debt. She reported that she also owed direct \nfederal student loans of $19,700, which she started repaying at $100 a month in July \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2011. She stated that those loans would be paid off in 2025. (GE 11.) Applicant admitted \nat her hearing that she did not follow through with those plans. (Tr. 53.) Applicant told the \ninvestigator that she settled the delinquent car loan for $6,090 and made her first monthly \npayment of $200 in August 2011. As for the $10,373 credit-card delinquency, Applicant \nstated had made payments of $200 in July 2011 and $500 in August 2011, and would \npay $500 in September 2011 and $366 in October 2011 with $366 monthly payments \nthereafter. Applicant had not contacted her creditors to whom she owed $4,290 and \n$6,199, as she was waiting until she had reduced the balances of the accounts on which \nshe was making payments. (GE 11.) \nDuring her interview, Applicant attributed her delinquencies to being young and \nirresponsible with her money. She had allowed her then boyfriend and her sister to live \nwith her, and she supported them because they were unemployed. Applicant also gave \nher mother $2,000 a month in financial support. Applicant stated that she could meet her \nfinancial obligations because she was no longer supporting her mother, her sister, or her \nformer boyfriend. Applicant explained that she had paid $6,000 to a debt-settlement firm \nfor assistance in resolving her debts, but when she saw no progress, she decided to \narrange payment plans on her own. (GE 11.) \nIn July 2014, following her mother\u2019s death, Applicant resigned from her job of nine \nyears. She decided to take some time off from working and was unemployed until May \n2015. From May 2015 to November 2015, Applicant worked for a technology company \nas a design engineer. (GE 1.) Wanting a more stable work environment, Applicant took a \njob with a contractor on a federal installation. On December 3, 2015, she completed a \nDeclaration for Federal Employment on which she answered \u201cYes\u201d to whether she was \ndelinquent on any federal debt. She listed three delinquent student loans: $3,835 and \n$14,922, which were late as of May 2013, and $19,752, which was late as of April 2012. \nShe added that she was scheduled to meet with a financial advisor to establish a \nrepayment plan to pay off her student loans within five years. (GE 2.) Applicant did not \nshow for her appointment with the financial advisor. (Tr. 54.) She could not explain why \nshe failed to address her student loans when she had been diligent about cleaning up her \ncredit in other areas. (Tr. 54-55.) \nIn January 2017, Applicant quit her job and moved back to the state where she \nwas raised. She had been required to make presentations to large groups of people, and \nit caused her anxiety. (GE 1.) Applicant worked as a substitute teacher from April 2017 \nuntil November 2017, when she decided to return to engineering full time. From \nNovember 2017 to November 2018, she worked for a company that supports her current \nemployer. In November 2018, she accepted a full-time position with her employer, a \nlaboratory that has DOD contracts. (GE 1.) \nOn December 11, 2018, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an SF 86 \nfor her current background investigation. In response to an inquiry into whether she was \ncurrently delinquent on any federal debt, she listed a $14,659 student loan and stated, \u201cI \nworked to pay off other outstanding debt for [the] last 10 years and was also until recently \nhelping immediate family members financially.

(GE 1.) \nApplicant\u2019s credit report of January 10, 2019, showed two student loans in \ncollection for $12,995 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and $3,329 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Those loans, which had been \nplaced with the U.S. government in November 2009, appear to be the loans once held by \nSallie Mae (account #96). Additionally, an automobile loan obtained in August 2012 for \n$23,768 had been charged off for $6,819 in May 2013 after she stopped making her $646 \nmonthly payments. As of November 2018, the creditor was claiming a debt balance of \n$8,246 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Several debts were in collection status: $884 from April 2014 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c); $508 assigned in August 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); $293 owed since November 2017 to \na cable services provider (SOR \u00b6 1.h); $258 on a cell phone account since October 2015 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i); $199 for insurance assigned in August 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $195 on a cell \nphone account since November 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); $150 for medical services from \nSeptember 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and $144 on an account assigned in June 2016 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.k). (GE 7.) \nDuring an interview with an OPM investigator on February 21, 2019, Applicant was \ngiven five days to provide information about the delinquencies on her credit report that \nshe did not list on her SF 86. When re-interviewed on February 27, 2019, Applicant did \nnot recognize the $144 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k) or the $150 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nShe acknowledged the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.k. As for the cable-services debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h, Applicant explained that when she had her cable service disconnected, she was told \nthere was no balance due. Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $508, Applicant explained \nthat it was a credit-card balance that kept accruing after her automatic payments stopped. \nShe believed the $884 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was on a closed cell phone account. \nHer new cell phone provider promised to pay off the debt and then did not pay it. About \nher federal student loans, Applicant stated that she was trying to consolidate them. \nRegarding the car-loan delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.e), Applicant stated that she made her loan \npayments until 2013. She tried several times to return the vehicle to the dealer who would \nnot accept it, so she eventually just left the vehicle at the dealership. (GE 10.) \nOn February 22, 2019, a collection entity agreed to settle some $13,736 in student-\nloan debts balances on four accounts (accounts starting #96) on receipt of a lump-sum \npayment of $2,128 by February 27, 2019. (AE D.) Applicant contacted her creditor on \nDecember 1, 2021, and she was told that she owed the $2,128. The creditor was looking \ninto the debt and remains willing to accept the $2,128 in settlement if she did not already \npay it. (Tr. 51.) Applicant testified that the settlement may be for the federal student loans \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f, but she was not certain. (Tr. 39, 50.) \nAs of March 13, 2020, the collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c were still on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report as unresolved. Two loans held by the U.S. Department of \nEducation, of $19,752 (likely the direct loans) and $14,922 (likely the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.f) were listed as having zero balances after transfer. The other SOR debts were not \non her credit report with Equifax Mortgage Solutions. (GE 6.)

She provided documentation showing that the cable-services \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.h had been settled on August 4, 2020. (AE A.) The $199 insurance debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) was credited to her account and considered paid as of December 21, 2020. \n(AE B.) The $150 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) had also been paid in full (AE F; Tr. 34-35), \nalthough the record from the creditor does not reflect the date of payment. Similarly, the \ncollection entities holding the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k confirmed that those debts \nhad been paid, but the dates of debt satisfaction are not in evidence. (AEs H-J.) The \ncollection entity holding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c agreed to settle the $884 balance for a \nlump-sum payment of $353 on December 13, 2021. (AE G.) Applicant indicated in an \nemail that the debt has been paid and account closed, although she provided no \ndocumentary proof of the payment to settle that debt. \nOn December 1, 2021, Applicant expressed her intent to repay her outstanding \nstudent loans. (Tr. 43.) Applicant owes direct student loans (reported balance of $19,725, \naccounts starting #45). She had no plan established to resolve the debt. (GEs 6, 11.) \nWhen asked at her hearing about her plan to resolve that student-loan debt still \noutstanding, Applicant responded: \nSo what I\u2019m worried about is this is going to be a repeat of history and I\u2019m \ngoing to have all the conviction in the world at this exact moment [and] it\u2019s \nall going to dissipate when I walk away. But my plan is what it\u2019s always been \nthat I\u2019m going to contact, you know, the people \u2014 whoever they sold it off \nto and I\u2019m going to ask them what the balance is. And I\u2019m either going to \nask for a smaller payoff or \u2014 that\u2019s my plan like right this second and that\u2019s \nwhat I should do. (Tr. 77.) \nApplicant has made no effort to contact her creditors about the car-loan charged \noff for $6,819 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) or the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, which she believes is associated with \nthe car purchase. (Tr. 62.) She testified that she only drove the vehicle for two days before \nshe realized that it was not a reasonable vehicle for her. (Tr. 43.) She does not intend to \nrepay it because she believes she was persuaded to purchase a car that was too big, and \nshe did not want. (Tr. 60-61.) She believes the dealer should not hold her to the loan\u2019s \nterms. (Tr. 61.) \nApplicant had zero balances on all of her open accounts as of December 2021. \n(AE E.) Her current take-home pay for two weeks of work is $3,589. Her spouse is a \nstudent at a local community college and is unemployed. (Tr. 63-64.) They have a son \nwho attends daycare at $600 a week, and Applicant is expecting their second child. \nApplicant\u2019s other monthly expenses include rent at $2,150, around $200 for electricity, \n$50 for gas heat, $100 for the Internet, and $180 for cell phones.

(Tr. 68.) \nForeign Influence \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen from birth. Her parents immigrated to the United States \nand became U.S. citizens by naturalization. They were both deceased by December 2018 \nwhen Applicant applied for security clearance eligibility. Applicant is the fourth of six \nchildren. Her sister and the eldest of her four brothers acquired U.S. citizenship by \nnaturalization. Two of her brothers are U.S. citizens from birth. Her siblings reside in the \nUnited States. (GE 1; Answer.) \nApplicant traveled to Jordan to meet her future in-laws from July 14, 2016, to \nAugust 1, 2016. She returned to Jordan from July 27, 2017, to August 10, 2017, for her \nwedding to her spouse, a Jordanian citizen. Under Applicant\u2019s sponsorship, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse immigrated to the United States and is a U.S. permanent resident. (GEs 1, 10.) \nThe circumstances of their meeting and courtship are not in evidence. Applicant\u2019s spouse \nis currently a student at a local community college. (GE 10; Tr. 64.) During a February 21, \n2019 interview by an authorized investigator for the OPM, Applicant stated that her \nspouse came to the United States in 2017 after their marriage, and that he came to the \nUnited States for better opportunities and a chance to study. (GE 10.) \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are resident citizens of Jordan. (GE 1; Tr. 70.) Applicant \nhas had in-person contact with her parents-in-law only in Jordan, when she went there to \nmeet them and then for her wedding. (GE 10.) Applicant indicated on her December 2018 \nSF 86 (GE 1) and during her February 2019 interview (GE 10) that she had weekly \ntelephone contact with her in-laws. Applicant\u2019s spouse currently calls his parents on a \ndaily basis. Applicant exchanges only a brief greeting with her in-laws to be respectful. \nApproximately once a month and on special occasions, such as birthdays, Applicant \nconverses with her in-laws. (Tr. 70-71, 74.) Her parents-in-law do not know that she is \nunder consideration for security clearance eligibility. (GE 10.) \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law has been blind since he was five years old. (Tr. 44.) He is \nretired from his job with the government of Jordan as a phone operator at a blood bank. \n(GEs 1, 10; Tr. 73.) Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has never worked outside her home. (GEs \n1, 10; Tr. 44, 70.) Applicant and her spouse provide his parents about $2,400 a year in \nfinancial support to cover medical and living expenses. (GEs 1, 10; Tr. 71.) His parents \nown their home in Jordan. (Tr. 74.) They live an area in Jordan that is currently subject to \na Level 4 \u2013 Do Not Travel warning from the U.S. State Department due to terrorism and \ncrime. Applicant\u2019s spouse has three siblings: a brother in Jordan and two sisters who \nreside in the United States. (Tr. 74-75.) No information was provided about his siblings\u2019 \noccupations or activities. \nDuring her February 27, 2019 interview, Applicant was asked by the OPM \ninvestigator whether anyone would have reason for concern on viewing her social media \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccount.

(GE 10.) At her hearing, \nApplicant admitted that she had posted statements that someone might think \ncontroversial. (Tr. 76.) There is no evidence that she has ever acted on her opinions. \nAdministrative Notice \nAdministrative notice is not taken of the source documents in their entirety, but of \nspecific facts properly noticed and relevant and material to the issues. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts requested by the Government in HE I and of other facts \nset forth in the source publications from the U.S. State Department, including the updated \ntravel advisory and the bilateral relations fact sheet. \nJordan\u2019s form of government is a constitutional monarchy ruled by a king who has \nultimate executive and legislative authority. The United States has a long history of \ncooperation and friendship with Jordan, and appreciates the leadership role Jordan plays \nin advancing peace and moderation in the region. The two countries both seek a \ncomprehensive, just, and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and an end \nto the violent extremism that threatens the security of Jordan, the region, and the world. \nBased on shared strategic goals and a close working relationship, in 1996 the United \nStates designated Jordan as a U.S. major non-NATO ally. The United States is Jordan\u2019s \nsingle largest provider of bilateral assistance, providing more than $1.2 billion in 2020. \nDevelopment assistance programs reinforce the United States\u2019 commitment to broaden \ncooperation and dialogue with a stable, reform-oriented Jordan. The two countries have \nhad a Free Trade Agreement in place since 2000, which has helped to diversity Jordan\u2019s \neconomy and increased bilateral trade between the countries by over 800 percent over \nthe last 20 years. A strong U.S. military assistance program is designed to meet Jordan\u2019s \nlegitimate defense needs, including preservation of border integrity and regional stability \nthrough providing materiel and training. \nJordan remains at high risk for terrorism. Local, regional, and transnational groups \nand extremists have demonstrated a willingness and capacity to plan and executed \nattacks in Jordan, a key U.S. ally in combating terrorism and extremist ideology. The \ncurrent travel advisory from the U.S. State Department is Level 4 \u2013 Do Not Travel due to \nCOVID-19. Travelers are advised to exercise increased caution in Jordan due to \nterrorism. The State Department issued a Level 4 \u2013 Do Not Travel warning within 3.5 \nmiles of Jordan\u2019s border with Syria due to terrorism and armed conflict; to designated \nSyrian refugee camps in Jordan due to government restrictions; and to Zarqa, Rusayfah, \nand the Baqa\u2019a neighborhood of Ayn Basha due to terrorism and crime. All U.S. \ngovernment personnel on official travel to Zarqa, Rusayfah, and the Baqa\u2019a neighborhood \nmust be in daylight areas only. Personal travel by U.S. government personnel to these \ncities is not authorized. The U.S. State Department\u2019s annual crime and safety report for \nJordan issued on May 1, 2020, reported that the U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria and \nthe U.S. government\u2019s policies regarding Israel led more than 80% of Jordanians to hold \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nan unfavorable opinion of the U.S. government, although the anti-Western sentiment did \nnot extend to U.S. citizens or culture generally. \nCivilian authorities in Jordan maintained effective control over security forces in \n2020. Yet, significant human rights issues in Jordan included cruel, inhuman, and \ndegrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest and detention, including of activists \nand journalists; infringements on citizens\u2019 privacy rights; serious restrictions on free \nexpression and the press, including censorship and Internet-site blocking; substantial \nrestrictions on freedoms of assembly and association; official corruption; \u201chonor\u201d killings \nof women; trafficking in persons; and gender violence. Impunity remained widespread, \nalthough the Jordanian government took some limited steps to investigate, prosecute, \nand punish officials who committed abuses. There is no indication that the Jordanian \ngovernment used any coercive methods on its resident citizens to obtain U.S. sensitive \ninformation or that the Jordanian government targeted the United States for such \ninformation. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his or her \nfinances in a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board \nexplained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to the contract terms on the account.

AG \u00b6 19(b), \n\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d applies with respect to \nthe car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.e), which was charged off for $6,819. Applicant does not believe \nthat she should repay the balance, and she has taken no steps to resolve the debt despite \nhaving accumulated $60,000 in savings. \nApplicant initially stopped paying her student loans because she could not afford \nthe payments. She lived off savings and had some financial help from her brother when \nshe was unemployed from July 2014 to May 2015 after she chose to take time off from \nworking following the death of her mother. Even so, this case is less about AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d than about AG \u00b6 19(e), in that her financial problems were \nincurred largely because of questionable financial choices, including credit \nmismanagement. AG \u00b6 19(e) provides: \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \n \nApplicant made payments on her student loans through December 2009. As of \nAugust 2011, some of her student loans were in collection while others referred to the \nU.S. government were in deferment after having been in delinquency status. She told an \nOPM investigator in September 2011 that she had repayment plans in place for her \nstudent loans. She did not follow through with the plans. The deferred loans went into \ndefault status. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admission during her September 2011 interview and the \nMarch 2020 credit report, some $19,752 in additional student-loan delinquency could \nhave been alleged in the SOR. As it was not alleged, it cannot be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes. However, the Appeal Board has long held that conduct not alleged \nin an SOR may still be considered for one or more of the following purposes: \n(a) to assess applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence \nof extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to \ndecide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant\u2019s unalleged student \nloan debt is relevant in assessing mitigation, including whether she is likely to resolve her \noutstanding student-loan balances. Some $20,862 in credit-card collection debts on her \ncredit record as of August 2011 are not currently an issue. She apparently resolved those \ndelinquencies before her current background investigation. Applicant indicated in \nSeptember 2011 that she could meet her financial obligations because she was no longer \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupporting her mother, sister, or a former boyfriend. However, she exercised questionable \njudgment within AG \u00b6 19(e) when in August 2012, she took on a $23,768 car loan (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e) with a repayment term of $646 per month for five years for a vehicle that she was \nuncomfortable driving. After the car dealer refused to take back the car, she just left it at \nthe dealership and defaulted on her car payments. \nApplication of disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. The following may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply. Applicant listed the student loans alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f on her December 2018 SF 86. These were the only student loans \nthat appeared on her credit record as of January 2019, although she has acknowledged \nowing more than $19,000 in additional past-due student-loan debt. On February 22, 2019, \nshe accepted a settlement offer from the creditor holding the student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.f. The settlement required that she make a lump-sum payment of $2,128 by \nFebruary 27, 2019, to resolve a $13,736 balance. On December 1, 2021, she contacted \nthe entity holding those student loans and was told that she still owes the settlement \namount. Applicant provided no proof of settlement for those loans or the $19,752 in \nadditional student-loan delinquency that has dropped from her credit report. She has \nmade no efforts to contact the creditor about the car-loan deficiency in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Debts \nthat remained unresolved over several years can properly be characterized as a history \nof delinquent debt sufficient to raise security concerns under Guideline F. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. July 31, 2018). \n13 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA relevant consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b) is whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner to address her legitimate debts. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, \nn. 9 (App. Bd. Jan. 23, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, \n2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component of sound financial judgment is whether \nApplicant maintained contact with her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current or settle her debts. Her evidence falls somewhat short in \nthat aspect. Applicant settled the cable-services debt before the SOR was issued. Her \npayment to resolve the insurance debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was credited to her account on \nDecember 21, 2020, after she received the SOR. The collection entities holding the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k confirm that those debts have been paid, but their letters do \nnot report the dates of debt satisfaction. The collection entity holding the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c agreed to settle Applicant\u2019s $884 balance for a lump-sum payment of $353 on \nDecember 13, 2021. Applicant credibly asserts that the debt has been paid. Yet Applicant \ndid not offer a credible explanation for her delay in addressing those debts. Moreover, AG \n\u00b6 20(b) has no applicability to the car-loan deficiency, which she continues to disregard \nand is seemingly unwilling to address. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) warrants some consideration. Applicant\u2019s financial support for her \nmother and sister prior to September 2011, when they could not provide for themselves, \ndemonstrates family loyalty, which is a positive character trait. Applicant\u2019s subsequent \nperiods of unemployment from July 2014 to May 2015 and from January 2017 to April \n2017 followed voluntary resignations. Even so, the death of her mother in July 2014, \nwhich caused her to leave her longtime job, is a circumstance contemplated within AG \u00b6 \n20(b). Applicant worked as a substitute teacher from April 2017 to November 2017, which \nmay not have provided her enough income to address her delinquencies, although she \nprovided no details in that regard. However, Applicant has been consistently employed \nas an engineer since November 2017. She has worked full time for her current employer \nsince November 2018, and she accumulated some $60,000 in savings over the next three \nyears. \nThe Appeal Board has long stated that the timing of an applicant\u2019s efforts at debt \nresolution is relevant in evaluating the sufficiency of his or her case in mitigation \n(\u201cApplicants who begin to resolve their debts only after having been placed on notice that \ntheir clearances or trustworthiness designations are in jeopardy may be disinclined to \nfollow rules and regulations when their personal interests are not at stake.\u201d). See ADP \nCase No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01556 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2018)). Applicant had the financial means to have paid her smaller \ndebts sooner. Even so, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns with respect to \nthose debts which she settled under terms satisfactory to her creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c \nand 1.h-1.k). \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) has been shown to apply to her student loans \nor to the car-loan deficiency (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and associated debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g).

She is not sure that she paid the settlement amount, and the creditor \ntold her she owes the debt. If those loans have been settled, there is the matter of the \nadditional delinquent student-loan debt, which available credit information indicates \nexceeds $19,000. She has no established repayment plans in place for that student-loan \ndebt, the charged-off car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.e), or the associated $508 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \nWhile she may feel that she should not have to pay the deficiency balance on the car loan \ninasmuch as she turned in the vehicle, she did not provide any evidence of actions taken \nto dispute her legal liability for the debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) was not shown to apply. \nA security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. See ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App.  Bd. July 17, 2015). \nApplicant has taken steps to improve her finances. She owed no debt on her open \naccounts as of December 1, 2021. While she expressed a willingness to make payments \ntoward her student loans that are unresolved, her history of not making promised \npayments under previously established plans raises considerable doubts about whether \nshe can be counted on to make timely payments according to established terms in the \nfuture. Applicant has little confidence in her own commitment to address her student \nloans. The financial considerations security concerns are not fully mitigated. \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are resident citizens of Jordan. At Applicant\u2019s hearing, \nthe Government learned that Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s brother also resides in Jordan, but that \nrelationship was not alleged as raising Guideline B concerns. Accordingly, review of \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts and connections to determine whether they present a \nheightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b) \nis limited to her parents-in-law.  Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) provide: \n \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the familial ties \nand the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood \nof vulnerability to coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly \ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government; a close friend or family \nmember is associated with, or dependent on, the foreign government; or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In considering the \nnature of the foreign government, the administrative judge must take into account any \nterrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nJordan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States. The two countries share the \nmutual goals of a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace between Israel and the \nPalestinians, and Jordan is a committed ally in countering the violent extremism that \nthreatens Jordan and the region. The United States provides Jordan with significant \ndevelopment aid and military assistance to ensure that Jordan remains stable and \nprosperous. However, Guideline B concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the \nUnited States. Even friendly nations may have interests that are not completely aligned \nwith the United States. The Appeal Board has long held that \u201c[t]he United States has a \ncompelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, \norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-11570 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Jordan is not known to conduct \nintelligence operations against the United States. There is no report of Jordan using \ncoercive methods on its resident citizens to obtain U.S. sensitive information. However, \nJordan has some human rights problems and is at significant risk of terrorist activity within \nits borders. The risk of terrorism in Jordan has led the U.S. State Department to continue \nto advise travelers to exercise increased caution when in the country and to not travel to \ncertain areas of Jordan. Applicant\u2019s in-laws live in an area of significant risk with regard \nto terrorist activity, so the risk is heightened in that regard. \nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s spouse has close ties of affection to his parents, whom \nhe currently calls on a daily basis. To be respectful, Applicant will exchange greetings \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith her in-laws when her spouse calls them. Approximately monthly and on special \noccasions, Applicant will have extended conversations with her in-laws. She has had in-\nperson contact with her husband\u2019s parents only twice: when she was in Jordan in July \n2016 to meet them and in July 2017 for her wedding. Even so, there is a rebuttable \npresumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family \nmembers of his or her spouse. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-12659 (App. Bd. May 30, \n2013). Applicant and her spouse send his parents about $2,400 a year for their support. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 could apply in whole or in part with \nrespect to Applicant\u2019s foreign ties and contacts. They are: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nConcerning AG \u00b6 8(a), Applicant\u2019s father-in-law had been an employee of Jordan\u2019s \ngovernment prior to his retirement, but his duties answering the phone at a blood bank \ndo not generate security concerns. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law did not work outside her \nhome. However, AG \u00b6 8(a) is difficult for Applicant to satisfy, given her spouse\u2019s close \nties to his parents, and the risk of terrorism where his parents live. On a daily basis, \nApplicant\u2019s communication with her in-laws is casual in that it involves no more than a \nbrief greeting, but it is frequent. AG \u00b6 8(c) was also not established. \nIn evaluating whether Applicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States\u201d to trigger AG \u00b6 8(b) in mitigation, it is noted that \nApplicant has not exhibited or expressed any preference for Jordan. Applicant was raised \nand educated in the United States. Her parents are deceased, but her siblings are U.S. \nresident citizens. There is no indication that the Government inquired about the \ncircumstances under which Applicant met her spouse or the nature of their dating \nrelationship. She sponsored her spouse for his U.S. permanent residency, and he is \nattending a community college in the United States. Their son was born in the United \nStates. He is in daycare, and they are expecting their second child. Applicant has spent \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher entire career as an engineer in the United States. There is no evidence that she has \nany intention of moving to Jordan. There is no evidence that she has any financial assets \nin Jordan. Applicant\u2019s clear preference for her life in the United States weighs favorably \nin assessing whether she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest for the United \nStates. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies in mitigation of the foreign influence concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security clearance eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines F and B are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \nWith respect to Guideline B, personal character is less at issue than are her \ncircumstances. The Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. \n28, 2015) that \u201ccommon sense and a knowledge of the ways of the world suggests that \neven those whose character is unimpeachable could be faced with circumstances that \nwould seriously tempt them to place the safety of parents, siblings, or parents-in-law \nahead of other competing interests.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 19-01688 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, \n2020), the Board stated that \u201c[a]pplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an \napplicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgement that people may act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, such \nas a family member.\u201d Applicant is a self-proclaimed human rights activist, who has \nadmitted to having posted some controversial statements on social media. No negative \ninference is drawn from her expressing her personal opinions, given there is no evidence \nthat she has ever acted contrary to the U.S. interests. However, her statements do raise \nher public profile and make it more likely that she could come to the attention of someone \nwho might target her for classified information. Her openness about her social media \nposts suggests that she is likely to report any attempt at undue foreign influence. \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws do not know that she is under consideration for a security clearance. \nWhile the risk of undue foreign influence cannot be completely discounted, it is mitigated \nby her longstanding ties to the United States. \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nApplicant\u2019s attitude toward some of her debts is of significant security concern. She \ndisregarded her repayment responsibility for some debts because she saw no detrimental \nimpact by her not paying them. This demonstrated tendency to act in self-interest is \nincompatible with the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that is required to \nhold security clearance eligibility. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding \nan applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant \nor renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990). Based on the evidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests \nof national security to grant security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.k: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

The record did not indicate his educational history. He has been employed as a senior information technology administrator by a defense contractor since April 2003. Applicant previously held a security clearance during his military service. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1989 through 1996, when he reportedly received an honorable discharge. (Item 3) The SOR alleged identical facts, under Guidelines J and E, concerning Applicant\u2019s 1994 conviction for felony sexual offenses involving a minor. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the Guideline J allegation. Although he did not respond to the Guideline E allegation, I consider it admitted given his Guideline J response.

On \nJanuary 13, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines J and E. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 3, 2021, and requested a decision \nbased on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On July 9, 2021, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \npleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 8.

The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2021. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItems 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 8 are admitted \ninto evidence. Item 8 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, \nI conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 8. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 8 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise an objection to Item 8 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond \nto the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item \n8 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant did not respond to the FORM \nor object to Item 8. \nI sua sponte took administrative notice of the documents discussed below, which \nare identified in the record as Administrative Exhibits (AX) I through IV. \nAdministrative Notice \nA 1991 sexual battery statute and its 1993 amended version were referenced in \nthe record. Because the statute underlay the 1994 conviction alleged in the SOR, the text \nof the statute and its amended versions are relevant to my decision. Since they were not \nsubmitted by either party, I sua sponte took administrative notice of the statute and its \namended version, as well as the legislative history of the amendment, and appended \ncopies to the record as AX I through IV. \nThe 1991 statute contained a separate section pronouncing that \u201c[a]ny person who \n[stood] in a position of familial or custodial authority to a child 12 years of age or older but \nless than 18 years of age\u201d and who \u201cengage[d] in sexual activity with that child is guilty of \na felony of the first degree.\u201d \u201cSexual activity\u201d was defined as \u201cthe oral, anal, or vaginal \npenetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another . . . .\u201d The separate section was \nremoved and its substance was incorporated into the provisions of the amended 1993 \nstatute. Specifically, the incorporated provisions declared that it was a felony of the first \ndegree for a person who was \u201cin a position of familial or custodial authority to a person \nless than 18 years of age\u201d to engage \u201cin any act with that person while that person is 12 \nyears of age or older but less than 18 years of age which constitutes sexual battery.\u201d \nAlthough the term \u201csexual activity\u201d was no longer referenced in the 1993 amended statute, \nthe term \u201csexual battery\u201d was similarly defined as \u201coral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or \nunion with, the sexual organ of another . . . .\u201d (AX I, III) \nPresumably Applicant was convicted upon the 1991 statute in effect at the time of \nhis criminal conduct. However, the statutory references in the record created confusion \non that issue. Applicant\u2019s plea agreement dated July 1994 (Item 5 at 12-13) referenced \nthe 1991 statute (AX I), while his arrest record dated March 1994 (Item 5 at 3) and court \nrecords (Item 5 at 1-2) referenced the 1993 amended statute (AX III). Because the 1991 \nand 1993 versions of the statute are substantially similar, that ambiguity is \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsequential in the matter before me. The 1992 version of the statute (AX II), which \ndid not contain a provision or section about persons in a position of custodial authority, \nwas included merely for reference. The legislative history (AX IV) was included to highlight \nthe changes between the 1991 and 1993 versions of the statute. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 59, married his second wife in 2013. His first marriage of six years \nended by divorce in 2009. He has one adult son from his first marriage. The record did \nnot indicate his educational history. He has been employed as a senior information \ntechnology administrator by a defense contractor since April 2003. Applicant previously \nheld a security clearance during his military service. He served in the U.S. Air Force from \n1989 through 1996, when he reportedly received an honorable discharge. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged identical facts, under Guidelines J and E, concerning Applicant\u2019s \n1994 conviction for felony sexual offenses involving a minor. In his SOR answer, \nApplicant admitted the Guideline J allegation. Although he did not respond to the \nGuideline E allegation, I consider it admitted given his Guideline J response. (Items 1, 2) \nApplicant had contact with the victim as an advisor to their church\u2019s youth group, \nin which she served as president. A criminal investigation was initiated after the victim \nreported that Applicant raped her. Applicant stated: \u201cApparently, [the victim] had sought \ncounseling and revealed our prior relationship to her counselor and subsequently, her \nparents.\u201d Throughout the record, Applicant repeatedly referred to his sexual contact with \nthe victim as consensual and, aside from his guilty plea, never acknowledged raping her \nor any other nonconsensual sexual contact. (Item 7 at 1-2; Item 8 at 3) \nApplicant reportedly told the victim that if she told anyone that he raped her, it \nwould ruin the church and her family. According to one witness (Witness A), Applicant \nadmitted that he raped the victim. During a phone call he initiated to Witness A, Applicant \nindicated that the victim accused him of rape. Witness A then asked Applicant whether \nhe raped the victim. Believing that his reply would be kept in confidence, Applicant \nadmitted to Witness A that he raped the victim. During a subsequent call Applicant \ninitiated to Witness A a few days later, Applicant asked Witness A to see if the victim \nwould be willing to meet with Applicant and talk about the possibility of an out-of-court \nsettlement. (Item 5 at 3, 9, 10) \nIn March 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with multiple felony sexual \noffenses after an investigation indicated that he raped the victim on four occasions \nbetween August 1992 and August 1993, and attempted to rape her in September 1992. \nThe charges reflected Applicant\u2019s custodial authority over the victim because of his role \nas the church\u2019s youth group advisor; and that the victim was a minor. Applicant stated \nthat she was age \u201c16 years and 9 months\u201d at the time of the offenses for which he pleaded \nguilty. (Item 5 at 3; Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 3; Item 2) \nApplicant was originally charged with four counts of engaging in sexual activity with \na victim age 12 to 18 years old as a person in a position of custodial authority; and one \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncount of attempting sexual activity as a person in a position of custodial authority. In July \n1994, Applicant pleaded guilty to amended charges pursuant to a plea agreement in \nexchange for which certain charges were nolle prossed. In August 1994, the court \naccepted Applicant\u2019s plea and sentenced him to five years of prison followed by ten years \nof probation, and ordered him to undergo counseling and register as a sex offender. The \ncharges to which Applicant pleaded guilty were: two counts of sexual activity by a \ncustodial authority (a first-degree felony); and one count of attempting sexual activity by \na custodial authority (a second-degree felony). Special conditions of his probation \nincluded that Applicant could not: 1) have either direct or indirect contact with the victim; \n2) have unsupervised contact with females under 18 years of age; or 3) supervise anyone \nunder age 18, unless approved by his probation officer. (Item 5 at 1-2,12-13; Item 7 at 4; \nItem 8 at 3) \nAlthough it is unclear for how long Applicant remained incarcerated or the date his \nprobation ended, the record indicated that he was released on good behavior from prison \nabout two and one-half to three years into his sentence and successfully completed \nprobation in about November 2009. Immediately following his release from prison, he was \nrequired to report to his probation officer on a monthly basis, and then was transitioned, \nin about May 2000, to an administrative probation, which afforded him the freedom to \ntravel. He underwent court-ordered counseling with a sex-offender therapist in connection \nwith his probation, weekly at first and then monthly, for an undefined period. (Item 5; Item \n7 at 3-4; Item 8 at 3) \nThroughout the record, Applicant expressed remorse, and professed to have \naccepted full responsibility, for his criminal conduct. He also insisted that he had been \nopen and honest about it in his personal and professional life. Conversely, he repeatedly \ncharacterized the sexual contact underlying his conviction as consensual and claimed to \nhave had a romantic relationship with the victim based on a mutual attraction. \nIn a November 2004 signed sworn statement (apparently provided in connection \nwith a previous background investigation), Applicant stated: \nI am deeply remorseful for my actions in 1992 that led to the criminal charge \nand subsequent incarceration and probation. At the time [the victim] told me \nthat if our relationship was discovered she would tell the authorities that she \nconsented. I realize under [my home state\u2019s laws] she was not legally \nrecognized as being of the age to grant consent and I hold no ill will against \nher for the charge brought against me due to our relationship. I have not \nhad any contact with her since right after the break-up and I do not plan to \never have contact with her in the future. . . My 1994 charge of sexual \nbattery/coercion is common knowledge to my family, friends, and co-\nworkers. . . . As a registered sexual offender, my offense is a public record, \nwhich is something I have come to accept through my incarceration and \ntherapy. (Item 7) \nApplicant also averred that his 1994 conviction resulted from a \u201crelationship\u201d he \nhad with the victim. He claimed that they \u201cstarted out as friends and then developed a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmutual attraction which led to a sexual relationship over a period of about two months in \nearly 1992.\u201d He asserted: \u201cI ultimately ended the relationship because I felt guilty and \nknew it was not a healthy union for either of us. I also left the church to put some distance \nbetween us.\u201d He maintained: \u201cAt the time of my extra-marital affair my wife had no \nknowledge of it. After I was charged was when she found out and she subsequently left \nme and filed for divorce.\u201d His ex-wife was granted custody of their son. (Item 7) \nApplicant explained in his 2004 statement that he was experiencing marital \nproblems during his self-described consensual relationship with the victim, yet also \nstated: \u201cI realized that does not excuse my behavior.\u201d Applicant contended: \u201cI have rebuilt \nmy life and done everything in my power to ensure I am never involved in a situation that \ncould lead to criminal charges in the future.\u201d (Item 7 at 2, 4) \nDuring his August 2019 security clearance interview (in connection with the current \nbackground investigation), Applicant reiterated that he had an extra-marital affair with the \nvictim. While he acknowledged having sexual relations with the victim on three separate \noccasions, he maintained that they were consensual. He claimed that he ended the \nrelationship with the victim after deciding that it was inappropriate. He characterized the \n\u201ccriminal activity\u201d for which he was convicted as sexual battery/coercion of a female age \n17. Although he acknowledged that he had no justification for this \u201ccriminal activity,\u201d he \nalso rationalized that it occurred because he had low self-esteem and was struggling with \nhis wife and marriage. He averred that he had spent 10 years trying to figure out what \nhappened. He affirmed that he would not ever allow his criminal activity to recur, avoided \nany and all risky environments or any perceived evil, no longer volunteered or had any \ncontact associated with a vulnerable population. (Item 8 at 3) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant stated: \nI came to the conclusion [sic] long time ago that my past is something I can\u2019t \nchange or hide from. Furthermore, my criminal history is public information. \nI have always been upfront and forthcoming about my past to my employer, \nsupervisors and anyone else that should be aware of my past. [About] 27 \nyears ago I stepped up and paid my debt to society and faced my past with \nbrutal honesty. The brief consensual affair with the [] victim []was illegal and \nmorally wrong. I fully acknowledge that I was the adult in the situation and I \nshould have recognized the situation for what it was. \nApplicant proffered that he has been entrusted with the protection and integrity of \nunclassified data and company proprietary information for more than 17 years and has \nreceived praise from cyber-security professionals. He asserted that his \u201cadvanced skill \nsets and deep experience\u201d could serve the national interests if he were granted a security \nclearance.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v.

The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nThe record establishes the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the \nconcerns under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nThe sexual offenses for which Applicant was convicted were egregious, particularly \ngiven the victim\u2019s age and his position as an advisor to the church\u2019s youth group. I did not \nfind credible his protestations of a benign relationship with the victim. There is substantial \nevidence that his sexual contact with the victim was not consensual. I found the evidence \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat Applicant reportedly admitted to raping the victim compelling. Even assuming \narguendo that Applicant had not had sexual intercourse with the victim against her will, \nthe charges for which he pleaded guilty and was convicted together with the special \nconditions of his probation denote the severity of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct. The fact \nthat he was a member of the U.S. military at the time of these offenses further exacerbates \nthe security concern with his criminal conduct. I considered the significant time that has \npassed without recidivism or new criminal charges. However, the nature of his criminal \nconduct and the fact that he remains a registered sex offender preclude mitigation. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s failure to be forthright about his criminal conduct and to fully accept \nresponsibility for his unlawful actions casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(b) are not established. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns under this guideline, as set out in AG \u00b6 15, include: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d \nIn its FORM, the Government argued that the disqualifying conditions set forth in \nparagraphs 16(a) and 16(b) under Guideline E are established by the evidence in the \nrecord, presumably based on Applicant\u2019s lack of candor about the nature of his sexual \ncontact and relationship with the victim. However, the Government did not allege facts \nsurrounding his lack of candor in the SOR. Thus, I will consider those facts only to \nevaluate mitigation and the whole-person concept. \nNone of the other listed disqualifying conditions under Guideline E applies to the \nfacts alleged in the SOR given my adverse determination under Guideline J, including AG \n\u00b6 16(d) as argued by the Government in its FORM. However, the facts alleged in the SOR \nestablish the general concerns involving Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment and \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the \nconcerns under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline J, the security concerns raised under \nthis guideline have not been mitigated. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor about the nature of his \nsexual contact and relationship with the victim further magnifies the security concerns \nabout his personal conduct. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines J and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his 1994 conviction for felony sexual offenses involving a minor. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 86) \nApplicant\u2019s wife did not \u201ccome clean\u201d about the extent of their financial problems until early \n2020, after Applicant told her that their financial problems, previously unbeknownst to him, \ncompelled his facility security officer to speak with him. (Tr. 58, 86) \nIn 2012, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s anxiety began taking a toll on her health, as she had \u201c\u201dan \nexceptional [sic] difficult time recovering from the birth\u201d of their first child. (Tr. 51) After \nrecovering from childbirth, she hired a nanny and returned to work. The help of a nanny did \nnot ameliorate the anxiety that Applicant\u2019s wife experienced before taking maternity leave. \nIn fact, her multiple roles as \u201can employee, a mother, a wife, and an employer,\u201d triggered \npostpartum depression. Although her doctor prescribed medication in 2013, the illness did \nnot resolve until 2015. (Tr. 52) That year, Applicant\u2019s wife left her job and took one that was \nmuch closer to home. Her new position paid only about half of what she earned previously. \n(Tr. 73) By then, Applicant and his wife had fallen behind on their mortgage loan and their \nhome equity line of credit, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, and on one of \nApplicant\u2019s credit card debts, as alleged in subparagraph 1.c. Moreover, they had failed to \nfile their federal and state income tax returns for 2014 through 2018, as alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.d through 1.f. \nSOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b relate to a home Applicant and his wife purchased \nin 2013. (GE 1 at 40: AE B) When they financed their mortgage loan, their lender did not \nescrow the property taxes, as Applicant and his wife decided to make payments to the tax \nauthority directly. (Tr. 59) In 2018, they did not set aside enough money to pay their \nproperty taxes. Consequently, when the taxes became due, they could not afford to make \nthe payments. (Tr. 59) The mortgage company then began prorating the delinquency and \nadding it to the monthly mortgage payment, resulting in an $800 monthly increase. (Tr. 60) \nApplicant and his wife began to fall behind on their mortgage. They then applied for a loan \nmodification. (Tr. 61) While they were negotiating a modification, the lender filed a \nforeclosure action. (Tr. 61) After the bank approved the loan modification, Applicant and his \nwife began rehabilitating the mortgage. By May 2020, they had caught up on the mortgage \npayments through the rehabilitation plan. (Tr. 94) The lender then dismissed the \nforeclosure action. (GE 2) As of the date of the hearing, both the mortgage and the home \nequity line of credit accounts were current. (AE B, AE C) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c, totaling $385, is the final interest charge on a \ncredit-card bill that Applicant and his wife paid in a lump sum. He suspects that the interest \naccrued while the lump-sum payment was in the mail. (Tr. 101) Applicant and his wife \nsatisfied this debt in July 2020. (GE 2 at 13) \nApplicant and his wife began struggling with federal income tax payments in 2012, \nthe first year they hired a nanny. They had difficulty properly accounting for the payroll tax \nand related taxes associated with employing a household caregiver. (Tr. 26) When \nApplicant\u2019s wife calculated the income tax due for tax year 2013, it totaled $10,000. (Tr. 52) \nThey were unable to afford this payment, and things \u201cspiraled from there.\u201d (Tr. 53) Each \nsuccessive tax year, Applicant\u2019s wife did not file their federal or state income tax returns. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen she eventually told Applicant about these failures, she explained that she did not \nknow how to rectify the prior years\u2019 deficiencies and was afraid they would owe taxes that \nwere beyond their incomes. (GE 1 at 36) In lieu of complying with their income-tax return \nfiling obligations, Applicant\u2019s wife focused on whatever financial problem was \u201con the \nhorizon,\u201d and she let the tax issues spiral out of control. (Tr. 53) Ultimately, they failed to \nfile their federal income tax returns for 2014 through 2018. \nIn February 2020, Applicant and his wife retained an accountant. (GE 2 at 8) With \nhis help, they filed their delinquent state income tax returns and paid the deficiency, totaling \n$2,309. (GE 2 at 17-19) After resolving the delinquent state income tax returns, Applicant \nthen focused on the delinquent federal income tax returns, filing them by the summer of \n2020. (Tr. 24) Currently, he owes a balance of $183,000. (AE E; Tr. 23-24) \nAfter filing their delinquent income tax returns in July 2020, Applicant and his wife, \nwith the help of their accountant, initially requested to arrange an installment plan with the \nIRS to repay the tax delinquency. (Tr. 24) The IRS rejected this plan. After the rejection, \nApplicant in November 2021 then filed a request to pay the delinquency through a \nwithdrawal from his 401k plan. (Tr. 24, 26) The approval is still pending. The approval \nprocess is taking a long time because there was initially a dispute about the amount of tax \ndelinquency. Specifically, after Applicant\u2019s accountant filed the returns, the IRS refused to \naccept the respective Schedule H forms, contending that the accountant\u2019s inclusion of \nthem in the tax returns was erroneous. (Tr. 26) Applicant and his spouse then instructed \ntheir accountant to re-file the returns without the Schedule H. Several months later, the IRS \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s accountant calculated the taxes correctly when he initially filed \nthe returns with the Schedule H forms. \nApplicant\u2019s accountant, an expert in assisting individuals resolve tax delinquencies, \ntestified that it was unusual for the IRS to make such a mistake. In addition, he testified \nthat the approval process for a 401k withdrawal was taking two to four times longer than \nusual. (Tr. 31) He is having similar problems with other clients and attributes it to staffing \nproblems at the IRS and lingering problems stemming from the pandemic. (Tr. 31-32) \nApplicant has a balance of $180,000 in his 401k plan. (AE L) He requested to \narrange a temporary payment plan while the approval of the 401k withdrawal plan is \npending. (Tr. 33) The IRS rejected this offer, and advised him to wait until they make a \ndecision on the 401k plan. Applicant was then informed that while the approval process is \npending, there will be a hold on any collection actions. (Tr. 34) \nIn March 2021, Applicant and his wife retained a financial counselor. With his help, \nthey crafted a budget. According to the budget, they have $5,706 of monthly discretionary \nincome. (AE G at 6) Applicant and his wife have a stronger, more transparent relationship, \nas they now communicate regularly about their finances. (Tr. 63) They discuss any \npotential expenditure before making it, and they sit down weekly \u201cto talk about what is \ngoing on in [their] family, what [their] financial obligations are, [and] how [they are going to] \nhandle things that pop up.\u201d (Tr. 62) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) \nApplicant satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c. I resolve this debt in his \nfavor. His remaining debts, together with his late income tax return filings, however, trigger \nthe application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d 19(c); \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations;\u201d and 19(f),\u201dfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this \ncase: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant was unaware of his financial problems, as his wife managed the family \nfinances, fell behind on bill payments, and tax filings, and would lie to him about their \nfinances when he would periodically ask about them. Ultimately, however, applicants have \na responsibility to keep up with their finances, regardless of whether this responsibility is \nostensibly managed by a spouse or a domestic partner. The probative value of Applicant\u2019s \ncontention is further undercut by the number of years that he and his wife failed to file their \nincome tax returns or pay the delinquencies. Under these circumstances, the fact that \nApplicant\u2019s wife misled him about their financial stability does not constitute a circumstance \nbeyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant and his wife now work with a financial counselor who helped them \norganize a budget and manage their finances. In addition, Applicant and his wife now \ncommunicate about financial management and set aside time to discuss spending \ndecisions and pay bills. Since they have been transparent about their finances, they have \ncaught up on their mortgage payments and the payments on their home equity line of \ncredit. As for Applicant\u2019s tax problems, he and his wife retained an accountant who helped \nthem file their delinquent tax returns and is working diligently to help them resolve their tax \ndelinquencies. Although the amount of delinquent federal income tax is significant and \nApplicant has not yet begun to satisfy it, he initiated corrective actions one year before the \nissuance of the SOR. (See e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar 7, 2018)) \nMoreover, the delay in paying the tax delinquency does not relate to any lack of ability or \nwillingness to do so. Rather, it stems from the onerous nature of the resolution process, as \nthe IRS initially rejected the returns, contending that Applicant mistakenly filed them, then \ntold him a few months later, that they were, in fact, mistaken, and that his and his spouse\u2019s \njoint returns were originally filed correctly in July 2020. Applicant is working closely with his \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccountant and has ample income to either pay his tax debt through an installment \nprocess, a withdrawal from his 401k account, or some combination of both options. \nMoreover, the IRS stayed any collection activities pending the resolution of the \ndelinquencies. Under these circumstances, I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d) and 20(g) apply, \nand that Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThere was clearly a serious lack of communication between Applicant and his \nspouse, which lasted for several years during their marriage. His wife\u2019s shame at losing \ncontrol of the finances led her to lie to Applicant about their financial well being and \ngenerated a security concern for Applicant. He is not blameless, as his failure to work \ntogether with his wife on financial issues, while she was balancing multiple demands of \nmanaging her job, raising their children, working with the nanny, and overcoming an illness \nreflected a high degree of inattentiveness. Nevertheless, Applicant and his spouse have \naddressed their financial problems, paying the delinquent credit card balance, becoming \ncurrent on their mortgage and line of credit accounts, filing their delinquent income tax \nreturns, and working with their accountant to arrange the payment of their tax delinquency. \nIn addition, they are working with a financial counselor who has helped them better \nmanage their finances, and improve their communication skills so that these problems do \nnot recur in the future. \nSecurity clearance determinations are not intended to punish applicants for past \nshortcomings. When considered together with Applicant\u2019s outstanding work record, and his \nmodel character, as demonstrated by his assistance to the local military academy \nundergraduates, I am confident that Applicant will resolve the tax delinquency, and that no \nadditional financial problems will recur. I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since September 2009. He applied for and obtained a security clearance in 2010. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2004 and took additional college courses in 2009 without earning another degree. Applicant has been married since May 2000 and has three children. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) Applicant used marijuana from March 2006 until December 2006 to attempt to relieve stress and headaches. During this 2006 timeframe, he used marijuana about four to six times per month. He claimed he stopped using marijuana in December 2006 because he did not believe that his marijuana use was helping with his stress. (Items 5, 6) From April 2014 to February 2019, Applicant used marijuana for recreational purposes and to help alleviate stress and insomnia. He used marijuana about two to four times per week for a total of about 500 times over four and a half years. Applicant used marijuana with his wife, to whom he is still married, and with whom he still resides. He used marijuana while holding a security clearance throughout this period.

The Government exhibits included in the FORM are admitted in \nevidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since September 2009. He applied for and obtained a security \nclearance in 2010. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2004 and took \nadditional college courses in 2009 without earning another degree. Applicant has been \nmarried since May 2000 and has three children. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant used marijuana from March 2006 until December 2006 to attempt to \nrelieve stress and headaches. During this 2006 timeframe, he used marijuana about \nfour to six times per month. He claimed he stopped using marijuana in December 2006 \nbecause he did not believe that his marijuana use was helping with his stress. (Items 5, \n6) \nFrom April 2014 to February 2019, Applicant used marijuana for recreational \npurposes and to help alleviate stress and insomnia. He used marijuana about two to \nfour times per week for a total of about 500 times over four and a half years. Applicant \nused marijuana with his wife, to whom he is still married, and with whom he still resides. \nHe used marijuana while holding a security clearance throughout this period. There is \nno evidence that Applicant reported his 2014 to 2019 marijuana use to his employer. \nApplicant claimed that he will no longer use marijuana as he does not like the effects it \nhas on him. (Items 3, 4) \nApplicant reported his relevant marijuana use on the Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) he submitted in January 2020 and September 2009. He \ndiscussed his marijuana use when he was interviewed for his background investigation \nin April 2020 and December 2009. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) \nUnder Guidelines H and E, the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use from \n2014 to 2019 while he held a security clearance. In his response to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the Guideline H marijuana use allegation. He denied the Guideline E personal \nconduct allegation, stating that, while he may have shown \u201cquestionable judgment,\u201d he \nwas open and honest about his marijuana use during the 2020 investigative process.2 \n(Items 1, 2) \n2 Applicant\u2019s 2006 marijuana usage was not alleged in the SOR.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nFrom 2014 to February 2019 Applicant illegally possessed and used marijuana \nwhile he held a security clearance. Marijuana is a controlled substance and is illegal \nunder federal law. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \nApplicant's illegal drug use from 2014 to 2019 was frequent and occurred while \nApplicant was a mature adult. Throughout this period, Applicant held a security \nclearance. He presumably knew that using marijuana was an issue as he was \nquestioned about it and other illegal drug use during his 2009 clearance process. While \nhe last used an illegal drug in February 2019, this period of abstinence is significantly \nless than his period of use while holding a clearance. \nApplicant volunteered his marijuana use in his 2020 SF 86 and during his 2020 \nsubject interview. However, as Applicant began using marijuana again after earlier \ndivulging his use to the Government, I find his more recent openness to hold minimal \nmitigation value. Similarly, the recurrence of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use in 2014 after \nstopping for almost eight years undermines his continued abstinence. Given the \ncircumstances, Applicant has not abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate \nperiod, and I am unable to conclude that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 26(a) \nis not established. \nWhile Applicant acknowledged his past drug involvement and substance misuse, \nhe failed to provide sufficient evidence of disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts. Applicant used marijuana with his wife, with whom he still resides. He \nprovided insufficient evidence that his wife no longer uses marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) \nand 26(b)(2) are not established. While he certifies in his SF 86 that he will no longer \nuse illegal drugs, Applicant does not provide a signed statement acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(3) is not established. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable, and Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use \nis not mitigated. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but\nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive\ninformation; and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement is cross-alleged under Guideline E. That conduct \nreflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 \n16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is \nsufficient for an adverse determination under the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guideline. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. While Applicant has not used \nmarijuana in three years, he used it repeatedly and consistently for four and a half years \nprior to that. Earlier in his life, after eight years of abstinence, he began using marijuana \nagain, so he has a history of using marijuana after a period of abstinence. He used \nmarijuana after he knew or should have known that the Government had concerns \nabout its clearance holders using illegal drugs. These factors make me doubt that \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use is unlikely to recur or that he has taken sufficient positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThese factors also cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and his \nability and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 54 years old. He married in 1989 and separated from his wife in 1992. A divorce was never finalized. Since 2010 Applicant has cohabitated with a woman. He has six children. He received his high school diploma in 1985 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy after graduation. In 1995 he was administratively separated under Other Than Honorable conditions. He claimed at the hearing that his discharge was subsequently upgraded. He held a security clearance while in the Navy and during periods of subsequent employment. He was employed by a DoD contractor as a tradesperson since November 2018 and at the time of his submission of his e-QIP. In March 2022, he began working for a different DoD contractor. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 16-20, 35, 41-42.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) In paragraph 1 of the SOR, the Government listed numerous acts of misconduct by Applicant resulting in the issuance of bench warrants for failure to appear in court, including an outstanding bench warrant issued in June 2017 and charges of contempt of court on at least four occasions. The SOR also alleged that in 1994 Applicant was taken to Captain\u2019s Mast for offenses involving fraudulent checks. In addition, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately provided false information three times on his May 2019 e-QIP. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in paragraph 1, except he denied the falsifications by vir",

On March 22, 2022, Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on April 5, 2022. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Video Teleconference Hearing on \nApril 25, 2022. The case was heard as scheduled on June 16, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 24, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 54 years old. He married in 1989 and separated from his wife in 1992. \nA divorce was never finalized. Since 2010 Applicant has cohabitated with a woman. He \nhas six children. He received his high school diploma in 1985 and enlisted in the U.S. \nNavy after graduation. In 1995 he was administratively separated under Other Than \nHonorable conditions. He claimed at the hearing that his discharge was subsequently \nupgraded. He held a security clearance while in the Navy and during periods of \nsubsequent employment. He was employed by a DoD contractor as a tradesperson since \nNovember 2018 and at the time of his submission of his e-QIP. In March 2022, he began \nworking for a different DoD contractor. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nrelation to his employment. (Tr. at 16-20, 35, 41-42.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nIn paragraph 1 of the SOR, the Government listed numerous acts of misconduct \nby Applicant resulting in the issuance of bench warrants for failure to appear in court, \nincluding an outstanding bench warrant issued in June 2017 and charges of contempt of \ncourt on at least four occasions. The SOR also alleged that in 1994 Applicant was taken \nto Captain\u2019s Mast for offenses involving fraudulent checks. In addition, the SOR alleged \nthat Applicant deliberately provided false information three times on his May 2019 e-QIP. \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in paragraph 1, except he denied the \nfalsifications by virtue of responding only to the underlying claims of criminal conduct. \n(Answer at 1-3.) \nThe details regarding each of the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 1 are as \nfollows: \n1.a Outstanding bench warrant issued June 2017. Applicant failed to appear in \ncourt on June 15, 2017, as required for a readiness hearing on a driving violation citation. \nOn June 20, 2017, the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest and set bail at $10,000. \nThe underlying charge was issued in about February 2017 and was for Driving with a \nSuspended License (DSL), after his license was suspended or revoked for driving under \nthe influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant license has been suspended or revoked since \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nabout 1994 for DUI. He was originally arraigned on the DSL charge on May 1, 2017, after \nbeing stopped for speeding. He was also charged with speeding. In his Answer, Applicant \nadmitted the SOR allegation about an outstanding bench warrant and wrote that he was \nhomeless at the time and had custody of his son. He explained that he had no funds \navailable to pay a fine, although there was no fine to pay at the court hearing he missed. \nHe blamed his five-year delay in resolving the bench warrant on his work schedule, which \nincluded travelling overseas. At the DOHA hearing, he testified that he resolved the \noutstanding warrant in May 2022. He provided no documentation, however, to support \nhis testimony. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 21-25, 33; GE 7 at 9, 17.) \n1.b Additional bench warrants, and May 2009 arrest for Fugitive from Justice in \nanother state. The SOR alleged that bench warrants had been issued for Applicant\u2019s \narrest for failure to appear in court in State 1 in or about July 2005, September 2006, \nFebruary 2009, as well as the June 2017 bench warrant alleged in SOR 1.a. The SOR \nalso alleged that Applicant was arrested in May 2009 in State 1 for being a Fugitive from \nJustice in State 2. Following his arrest, he was extradited to State 2 on June 19, 2009. In \nhis Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in this subparagraph 1.b. He testified that \nthe bench warrants were issued because he was delinquent on his child support \npayments. At the DOHA hearing, he clarified that he assumed the bench warrants were \ndue to child support issues. He testified that he has two ongoing child support issues that \nhe hopes to resolve with an insurance payment for a car accident. He also explained that \nhe was extradited to State 2 for failure to pay a probation fine. He sought to shift the blame \nfor the non-payment of the fine in State 2 to a woman with whom he once had a \nrelationship. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 25-29, 36-37; GE 6 at 7; GE at 7 at 1, 5, 7, 17, 21.) \n1.c Multiple charges for Driving on a Suspended or Revoked License due to a prior \nDUI. Applicant was issued citations for this driving offense in or about December 1994, \nDecember 1995, March 2008, August 2008, December 2016, and February 2017. In his \nAnswer, he admitted these allegations and citations. He testified at the DOHA hearing \nthat he still has to complete an 18-month program to be eligible to receive his driver\u2019s \nlicense. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 29-33; GE 6 at 6; GE 7 at 13, 15.) \n1.d Multiple charges of Contempt of Court. Applicant has been found in contempt \nof court on at least four occasions, specifically in May 2005, September 2007, May 2009, \nand May 2012. In his Answer, Applicant admitted this allegation. At the DOHA hearing, \nhe explained that the contempt citations were likely due to delinquencies in his child \nsupport payments over a number of years. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 33-38; GE 6 at 6- 7; GE 7 \nat 10, 21.) \n1.e October 1994 Non-Judicial Punishment for issuing fraudulent checks. In his \nAnswer, Applicant admitted that he was charged with this offense. Included in the record \nevidence is a report of investigation prepared by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, \ndated October 18, 1994, which states that Applicant was punished administratively on \nOctober 16, 1994, in connection with a related Naval Criminal Investigative Service \ninvestigation into fraudulent check activity.

At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied the misconduct. \nHe admitted that he received another Captain\u2019s mast in 1995 and was administratively \nseparated from the Navy. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 38-43; GE 6 at 4; GE 8.) \n1.f. Falsification on e-QIP under Section 22 - Police Record. The focus of the \nGovernment\u2019s three falsification allegations under Section 22 of the e-QIP is whether \nApplicant has ever been convicted of an offense and sentenced to a term of imprisonment \nexceeding one year, or charged with a felony offense, an offense involving firearms, or \nan offense involving alcohol or drugs. He answered this question in the negative when in \nfact he had been charged with a felony offense and was convicted and sentenced to a \nterm of imprisonment exceeding one year. Separately, he was charged with an offense \ninvolving both drugs and a firearm. He has also been charged with an offense involving \nalcohol. The details are as follows: \n1.f.i Failure to disclose Applicant\u2019s April 2004 arrest in State 2 for \nPossession of Marijuana 5 Lbs or Greater. This was a felony charge. In his e-QIP, \nApplicant characterized this charge as a misdemeanor. The FBI report in the DOHA \nrecord reflects that both the charge at this arrest and the charge to which he pled guilty \nwere felonies. He was sentenced to two years of incarceration and five years of probation. \nIn August 2009, his probation was revoked because his fine had not been paid, and he \nwas sentenced to serve up to nine months in jail. Applicant\u2019s extradition from State 1 to \nState 2 in 2009, discussed in SOR 1.b above, was in response to his probation revocation. \nHe was released from jail in February 2010. In his July 2019 background interview, he \nfailed to voluntarily disclose that the charge was a felony. When confronted with the \nGovernment\u2019s information that the charge was a felony and he was sentenced to two \nyears of confinement, he did not dispute either fact. In his Answer, he wrote that the \ncharge was \u201cpresented\u201d as a misdemeanor though he acknowledged that the offense \n\u201ccarried\u201d a two-year sentence. He also denied that he possessed five pounds or more of \nmarijuana. At the DOHA hearing Applicant insisted the 2004 charge was for a \nmisdemeanor. He also denied being sentenced to two years of incarceration. Applicant \ndid not deny that he served nine months in jail after his probation was revoked for non-\npayment of the $8,000 fine imposed as part of his original sentence. His testimony was \ninconsistent with the FBI report in the record evidence that the charge was a felony and \nthat he was sentenced to two years of incarceration. His testimony was unconvincing and \nlacked credibility. Applicant\u2019s e-QIP falsification was deliberate. (Tr. at 43-47; GE 1 at 33-\n34; GE 2 at 12; GE 6 at 10-12.) \n1.f.ii Failure to disclose a December 1995 arrest and felony charge of \nPossession, Purchase Cocaine Base for Sale and related charges, including Possession \nof a Controlled Substance while Armed. Applicant pled guilty to Transportation with the \nIntent to Sell Narcotics Controlled Substance and was sentenced to 270 days in jail and \nthree years of probation. This charge is a felony, and it involved drugs and a firearm. \nApplicant failed to disclose this arrest and the charges, and he did not voluntarily disclose \nthem during his July 2019 background interview. In his Answer, Applicant did not try to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexplain why he did not disclose, in his e-QIP, these charges and conviction, for which he \nserved jail time. At the hearing, he sought to explain his omission based on the number \nof years that had passed since these charges. His testimony was unconvincing and \nlacked credibility. Applicant\u2019s e-QIP falsification was deliberate. (Tr. at 47-52; GE 1 at 32-\n34; GE 2 at 12; GE 6 at 5.) \n1.f.iii Failure to disclose February 1993 arrest and charge of DUI with a BAC \nover 0.10%. The documentary records in evidence reflect that Applicant was arrested for \nDUI on December 5, 1994. In his e-QIP, Applicant provided two separate dates for this \narrest, December 1993 and December 1994. At his hearing, Applicant testified that he \nonly had one DUI and that was in 1993. His license was suspended at that time. In his \nbackground interview, however, he described his DUI arrest as occurring in December \n1994. In his Answer, Applicant admitted to this arrest, though he denied having a BAC \nover 0.10%. I am unable to find in the evidence any official record of a second DUI offense \nin 1993, and Department Counsel did not note any such record. Applicant truthfully \ndisclosed on his e-QIP his one DUI, which occurred in December 1994 according to the \nofficial records. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 53-55; GE 1 at 32-33; GE 2 at 11; GE 7 at 11.) \n1.g Falsification on e-QIP under Section 24 \u2013 Use of Alcohol. Applicant failed to \ndisclose on his e-QIP treatment received in May 1993 at a Navy Counseling and \nAssistance Center (CAAC) as a result of his use of alcohol. Applicant was referred to \nLevel II treatment for alcohol abuse at a Navy CAAC and completed his treatment in May \n1993. The e-QIP question in Section 24 asks if the individual has ever been ordered or \nasked to seek counseling or treatment as a result of his use of alcohol. The question also \nasks if the individual has ever voluntarily sought counseling or treatment as a result of his \nuse of alcohol. Applicant answered both questions in the negative, which was incorrect. \nIn his Answer, he claims he was never ordered to attend CAAC, but he states that upon \nhis arrival at a new duty station he was sent to CAAC. It is unclear what he meant by \nthose statements. At the DOHA hearing, he clarified that he simply forgot about the \ntreatment. He further explained that he never sought the treatment nor was he ever \nordered to attend it. He testified that his attendance at the CAAC was simply part of the \nrequirement of reporting to a new duty station. He explained in his July 2019 background \ninterview that the CAAC alcohol education program also satisfied the education \nrequirements he was ordered to take after what he described as his 1993 DUI conviction. \nUnder the wording of the e-QIP question, his attendance at CAAC alcohol education \ntreatment required an affirmative answer. Applicant\u2019s testimony on this SOR allegation \nwas confusing, disjointed, unconvincing, and lacked credibility. Applicant\u2019s e-QIP \nfalsification was deliberate. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 55-59; GE 1 at 35-36; GE 2 at 11, 14.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government cross-alleges as criminal conduct the personal conduct \nallegation set forth in subparagraph 1.a. concerning the outstanding June 2017 bench \nwarrant. In his Answer, he denied having ever been involved in any criminal activity. He \nwrote that all of the alleged incidents of criminal activity were the result of \u201c\u2019being in the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwrong place at the wrong time.\u2019\u201d (Answer at 3; Tr. at 59.) As discussed above, Applicant \ntestified that the 2017 bench warrant was resolved, but he provided no supporting \ndocumentation. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR \nidentifies three past-due debts that have been referred to collection. The debts total about \n$9,000. In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations, but asserted that two \nof the debts had been resolved and that he has been trying to contact the creditor to \nresolve the third debt (SOR 3.b) (Answer at 3.) \nThe current status of the allegations in paragraph 3 of the SOR is as follows: \n3.a. Cellphone account in collection in the approximate amount of $1,416. \nApplicant admitted that he failed to pay this bill when it was due because he lost his job \nin 2018 and was unemployed for about two-to-three months (June 2018 to August 2018). \nHe testified that he paid this account in June 2021. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 60-61; \nGE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 6.) \n3.b. Rental account in collection in the approximate amount of $7,305. Applicant \nwas unable to pay his rent due to his loss of employment in June 2018. He was \nunemployed from June to August 2018. He vacated his residence in October 2018 with \nabout four months of rent ($1,780 per month) unpaid. Applicant testified that since he \nreturned from his most recent overseas business trip in 2021, he has tried to contact this \ncreditor, but he has not been successful. Applicant\u2019s background interview conducted by \na U.S. Government investigator occurred in July 2019. The investigator\u2019s report of \ninvestigation summarizing the interview was attached to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories in the \nrecord. Applicant noted in his interrogatory responses that he agreed with the report as \naccurate and adopted the report as his own statement. In that report, it was noted that \nApplicant was in contact with this creditor at the time of the interview. He was told he \nwould receive in the mail a statement with the balance due. He told the interviewer that \nhe planned to pay the debt off in installments by May 2020. He provided no documentary \nevidence addressing the current status of this debt or his claimed attempts to seek a \nresolution. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 61-63; GE 1 at 9, 15; GE 2 at 5, 14; GE 4 at 2; \nGE 5 at 5.) \n3.c.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior. \nThe record evidenced established three of the four falsification allegations in the \nSOR (1.f.i, 1.f.ii, and 1.g) and all of the misconduct allegations (1.a through 1.e). The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. SOR 1.f.iii is not established. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged falsifications and other personal misconduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) was established with respect to SOR 1.g by Applicant\u2019s voluntary \ndisclosure of his CAAC treatment after his DUI arrest and the court sentence, which \nincluded taking an alcohol education class. Applicant made no prompt good-faith \ndisclosure of the two charges that are the subject of SOR 1.f.i and 1.f.ii, so AG \u00b6 17(a) \ndoes not apply to those allegations. \nMitigation of the remainder of the SOR allegations under this paragraph (1.a \nthrough 1.f.ii) has not been established under AG \u00b6 17(c). The misconduct was serious \nand frequent. Most recently, his 2017 bench warrant has remained unresolved for the last \nfive years. Applicant testified that he resolved it shortly before the DOHA hearing, but \nprovided no supporting documentation. Applicant\u2019s irresponsible and unlawfull personal \nconduct over almost three decades casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe Government could have cross-alleged under Guideline J much of Applicant\u2019s \npersonal misconduct set forth under Guideline E, but chose instead to only cross-allege \nSOR 1.a under this guideline. I cannot consider unalleged conduct as disqualifying. \nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 31(a) has not been established because the one criminal offense for \nwhich Applicant was charged does not constitute a pattern of minor offenses. \nThe record evidence supporting SOR 1.a, however, fully establishes concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 31(b). This evidence shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his criminal conduct. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth four mitigating conditions under Guideline J. The following two \nmitigating conditions have possible application to the facts in this case: \n(a) so much time has passed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nNeither mitigating condition has been established. The criminal behavior is recent \nand did not happen under unique circumstances. The record contains no evidence to \nsuggest that it is unlikely that bench warrants for Applicant\u2019s arrest due to his driving on \na suspended license are unlikely to recur. Since 1993, he has not held a valid driver\u2019s \nlicense. Moreover, Applicant did not establish that he resolved a bench warrant that has \nremained outstanding for the last five years. This bench warrant casts doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. The three debts alleged in the SOR are recent, \nfrequent and did not occur under any unique circumstances that are unlikely to recur. The \ndebts cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially established. At least two of the debts may have arisen \nat a time when Applicant was unemployed in 2018 and may have been due to conditions \nthat were largely outside of his control. In 2021 he paid two of the debts (SOR 3.a and \n3.c), but he has not acted responsibly with respect to his largest debt for unpaid rent (SOR \n3.b). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is only partially established. Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the two smallest SOR debts. He has not initiated a good-faith effort to repay his \nlargest debt (1.b). \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, Applicant has not fully established mitigation of the security concerns \nraised in the SOR under this guideline. Paragraph 3 is resolved against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Further comment is warranted. Applicant\u2019s \nrepeated failures to appear in court and his being in contempt of court on multiple \noccasions, along with his failures to pay fines for criminal offenses, portray an individual \nwho is not reliable and trustworthy and who does not have the good judgment expected \nof an individual granted national security eligibility. Most recently, he did not establish that \nhe has resolved his 2017 bench warrant. Even if it has been resolved, as he says, it \nremained outstanding for five years. But given my concerns about his credibility, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that he resolved the bench warrant cannot be given credence. It is \nillogical to suggest that an applicant with a long-term, probably outstanding bench warrant \nis a suitable candidate for access to classified information. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.fii and 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.iii: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a. and 3.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since about June 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time. He is either a college graduate or just a few credits short of a degree. He is divorced with three children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 50, 72; GE 1) Applicant has a history of substance abuse and criminal offenses related to his substance abuse. He became addicted to prescription opioid painkillers after he injured his back sometime between about 2008 and 2011, resulting in significant pain. The physician\u2019s assistant who prescribed the medication was later sanctioned for overprescribing \u201coxycodone, hydrocodone, and other controlled substances\u201d to patients he was treating for pain management. Applicant\u2019s addiction led to doctor shopping for prescriptions, alcohol abuse, employment issues, marital difficulties, and financial problems. In addition to the opioid painkillers, he would sometimes drink between a pint and a fifth of vodka a day (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 3.a). (Tr. at 18-38, 82-96, 126; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, attachments A, F, P, S; GE 1, 2) Applicant was arrested in May 2013 and charged with two felony counts of falsely obtaining a prescription in December 2012 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.c). The essence of the offense is that he obtained a prescription for a controlled substance from one provider without informing the provider that he also received the controlled substance from another source.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since about June 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for \nthe first time. He is either a college graduate or just a few credits short of a degree. He \nis divorced with three children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 50, 72; GE 1) \nApplicant has a history of substance abuse and criminal offenses related to his \nsubstance abuse. He became addicted to prescription opioid painkillers after he injured \nhis back sometime between about 2008 and 2011, resulting in significant pain. The \nphysician\u2019s assistant who prescribed the medication was later sanctioned for \noverprescribing \u201coxycodone, hydrocodone, and other controlled substances\u201d to patients \nhe was treating for pain management. Applicant\u2019s addiction led to doctor shopping for \nprescriptions, alcohol abuse, employment issues, marital difficulties, and financial \nproblems. In addition to the opioid painkillers, he would sometimes drink between a pint \nand a fifth of vodka a day (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 3.a). (Tr. at 18-38, 82-96, 126; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR, attachments A, F, P, S; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant was arrested in May 2013 and charged with two felony counts of falsely \nobtaining a prescription in December 2012 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.c). The essence of the \noffense is that he obtained a prescription for a controlled substance from one provider \nwithout informing the provider that he also received the controlled substance from \nanother source. He pleaded guilty on June 11, 2013, to falsely obtaining a prescription. \nThe second count was dismissed. He was sentenced to up to five years in prison, which \nwas suspended upon his completion of probation for 36 months, and included \nconditions that he complete substance abuse treatment, and not possess or use \ncontrolled substances or alcohol. The felony was reduced by the court to a \nmisdemeanor in December 2017. (Tr. at 38-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, \nattachments A, G, H, N, P; GE 1-3) \nApplicant was arrested in August 2013 and charged with six felony counts of \nfalsely obtaining a prescription between April 1, 2013, and June 10, 2013 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n2.c). He pleaded guilty in October 2013 to three felony counts of falsely obtaining a \nprescription. The three remaining counts were dismissed. In January 2014, he was \nsentenced to up to five years in prison and $15,000 in fines. The prison term and \n$14,397 of the fine were suspended upon his completion of probation for 36 months. \nConditions of his probation included a drug and alcohol evaluation and completion of \nany recommended substance abuse treatment, and to not possess or use controlled \nsubstances or alcohol. The felonies were reduced by the court to misdemeanors in \nFebruary 2018. (Tr. at 38-41, 98; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, attachments A, H, N, P; \nGE 1-3) \nApplicant continued to abuse opioid painkillers and alcohol notwithstanding the \ntwo convictions and probation. He completed a 36-day inpatient substance abuse \ntreatment program from about February 2014 to April 2014. He reported that he was \ndrinking between a pint and a fifth of vodka a day with the opioids. He was diagnosed \nwith alcohol dependence and opioid dependence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 3.a, 3.b).

(Tr. at 40-43, 96; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, \nattachments I, P, R, S; GE 2, 5) \nApplicant did not follow through on aftercare or outpatient treatment, and he \nrelapsed after leaving the treatment facility. He found that alcohol enhanced the effects \nof the opioids. He was driving under the influence of opioids and alcohol when he was \narrested in May 2014. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was about two and a half \ntimes the legal limit. He was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs \n(DUI). He pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of impaired driving in May 2014. He was \nsentenced to 90 days in jail, with the 90 days suspended, and a fine (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 3.b, \n3.c). (Tr. at 42-46, 102-103; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, attachment J; GE 1-3, 5) \nIn June 2014, Applicant was found in violation of his probation for the 2013 \nconvictions, and his probation was revoked and restarted. He was sentenced to 150 \ndays in jail for the June 2013 conviction, with all but three weeks served at a work \nrelease facility (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He was sentenced to 365 days in jail for the August 2013 \nconviction, with all but three weeks served at a work release facility (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Tr. at \n47-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nAfter he completed the work-release program, Applicant resumed abusing \nalcohol and opioids, including oxycodone, morphine, and fentanyl (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b). \nFrom about April 2015 to June 2015, he used heroin during a period that he could not \nobtain the prescription opioids. Heroin was also cheaper than the prescription opioids. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.e). In June 2015, he checked into the same substance abuse treatment \nfacility for inpatient treatment for 45 days. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence \nand opioid dependence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f, 3.d). The facility certified that he successfully \ncompleted the inpatient program in July 2015. He was then provided a 45-day aftercare \nprogram. He was advised to remain abstinent from alcohol and opioids. In August 2015, \nhe successfully completed a workout-based life coaching program. (Tr. at 49-50, 51-57, \n59, 97-99; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, attachments K, L, P, R, S; GE 2, 5) \nApplicant did not use heroin after his discharge from the facility, but he returned \nto abusing alcohol and opioids, including fentanyl (SOR \u00b6 2.b). He was again driving \nunder the influence of opioids and alcohol when he was arrested in December 2015. His \nBAC was about two times the legal limit. He was charged with DUI and alcohol-\nrestricted driver. In March 2016, he pleaded guilty to DUI, and the alcohol-restricted \ndriver charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to four days in jail and a fine (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). (Tr. at 51-55, 102-103; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, attachment M; GE 4) \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has used any illegal controlled substances \nafter 2016. His parents, who could always tell when he was using, have not observed \nany indication of use in years. He returned to the workout-based program in 2016. He \nenrolled in a 90-day workout and addiction-recovery program in March 2019. The \nprogram \u201crequires at least 90 days of commitment to strenuous activity, dedication to \nsobriety, and active involvement in [their] fitness, nutritional, spiritual, and life coaching \ncurriculum.\u201d He continues to be actively involved in the program, and he sees a \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntherapist unrelated to that program.

He has disassociated himself from drug-using associates and contacts, and he \npassed numerous drug tests. He signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr. at 59-65, 70-82, 100-\n102, 107-121, 125-126, 135; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, attachments O, P, Q, T, U; \nGE 2; AE A, B) \nIn 2020, Applicant was prescribed a prescription opioid to deal with pain in a \ntooth before a root canal (SOR \u00b6 4.a). He did not enjoy the experience and did not use \nthe drugs again after the procedure was completed. He stated that he has not had \ncravings for opioids in four or five years, and the short use of a prescription medication \nin 2020 did not change that. (Tr. at 67-70, 94-96; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant stated that he does not believe that alcohol was ever his real problem, \nand that he never really enjoyed large amounts of alcohol. As such, he does not feel \nthat he has to completely abstain. He describes his drinking as occasional and \nresponsible. He stated that his last drink was in November 2021 (SOR \u00b6 3.f). (Tr. at 45, \n50, 65-67; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nAugust 2018. He reported most of his substance abuse and criminal history, but he \nintentionally failed to report his heroin use (SOR \u00b6 4.b). He admitted that he felt, and \ncontinues to feel, shame about his heroin use. (Tr. at 56-58, 103; Applicant\u2019s response \nto SOR; GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in June 2019. He \ndiscussed his addiction to opioid painkillers, including oxycodone, but he did not \nmention heroin use. He admitted heroin use in interrogatories in January 2020 after he \nwas specifically asked about heroin use as documented in records obtained by the DOD \nfrom the substance abuse treatment facility where Applicant was treated in 2014 and \n2015. He admitted at his hearing that if the DOD did not know about his heroin use, he \nwould be conflicted and it would be very hard to discuss it, even at his hearing. He \nclarified that if he was directly asked about his heroin use, he would be honest. (Tr. at \n104-106; GE 2) \nApplicant called three witnesses, and he submitted documents and letters \nattesting to his excellent job performance and strong moral character.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nApplicant has numerous arrests, convictions, and probation violations. The above \ndisqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe last alleged criminal offense occurred in June 2016, six years ago. He \nappears to have turned his life around. However, he was willing to be untruthful on his \n2018 SF 86, and he did not correct the lie until he was specifically confronted. It is a \ncriminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or \nfraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the executive branch of the \nGovernment of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are within the \njurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. It is not mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of substance use disorder; and \n(e) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed \nby a duly qualified medical or mental health professional; \nApplicant possessed and abused prescription opioids, fentanyl, and heroin. He \nwas arrested and convicted for multiple counts of falsely obtaining a prescription. He \nwas diagnosed with opioid dependence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(d) are applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges Applicant\u2019s opioid dependence diagnosis. That part of the \nallegation is established. It also alleges that \u201c[f]rom February 2014 through May 2014 \n[Applicant] \u201creceived inpatient and substance abuse and alcohol abuse treatment. . . . \n[He] did not follow through with aftercare or outpatient treatment and relapsed after \nleaving the facility.\u201d It should be obvious that Applicant\u2019s treatment does not raise a \ndisqualifying condition. He completed inpatient treatment. The question is whether his \nrelapse and failure to follow through on aftercare and outpatient treatment are sufficient \nto establish AG \u00b6 25(e) as a disqualifying condition. I am not convinced that the \nrecommendations that he attend aftercare and remain abstinent are enough to qualify \nas a failure to complete a prescribed drug treatment program. AG \u00b6 25(e) is not \napplicable, and that part of the allegation is concluded for Applicant.

The opioid dependence diagnosis is also alleged under SOR \u00b6 2.f. As such, SOR \u00b6 \n2.d is superfluous, and it is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThere is no evidence of any illegal drug use after 2016. I believe Applicant\u2019s \nparents that they knew when he was using. He appears to be on the right path. \nHowever, I have concerns that Applicant legally used prescription opioids in 2020, \nknowing that he is an addict; he continues to drink, albeit not in several months; and he \nwas willing to lie about his past use of heroin. \nApplicant\u2019s extensive criminal drug abuse continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are \ninsufficient to alleviate those concerns. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s opioid abuse, he would sometimes drink between a pint \nand a fifth of vodka a day. He was drinking and using opioids during his two DUIs, and \nhis BAC was about two and a half times the legal limit on one arrest and two times the \nlegal limit on another. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, and continues to \ndrink despite the recommendation that he remain abstinent. The above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant downplayed his drinking, essentially stating that it was incidental to his \nopioid abuse. Based on the amount he was drinking, his BAC levels on his two DUIs, \nand his alcohol dependence diagnoses, I cannot find it merely incidental. I believe his \ncontinued drinking puts everything at risk, including his recovery from opioids. None of \nthe mitigating conditions are sufficient to overcome concerns about his alcohol abuse, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, G, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct, alcohol consumption, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, and criminal conduct security concerns. The adjudicative guidelines give me \nthe authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of issue information \nthat can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I \nhave concluded the issues are not partially mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e-2.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and documentary evidence in the record are sufficient to \nestablish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant claims to have incurred most of his debts during his marriage with his \nspouse, and says that since his separation, she has been unwilling to contribute toward \nresolution of the debts. Applicant is unable to resolve them or he has been unable to \nmake significant progress to their resolution. \nApplicant\u2019s unresolved debts are numerous, long-standing, and a continuing \nfinancial concern. Additionally, his overall financial responsibility has been significantly \nimpugned and he has done little to resolve his debts despite knowing of their security \nsignificance since he was interviewed in 2018 and despite having a reliable employment \nhistory in his current job since January 2020. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s financial condition as a result of the separation may have \nbeen compromised by his spouse\u2019s current inability or unwillingness to contribute to debt \npayments, he remains responsible for the debts and has not made significant progress \ntoward resolving them. An applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before \nresolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). A promise to resolve \ndebts in the future is not a substitute for a track record of making payments in a timely \nmanner or otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 17-04110 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Applicant has not shown sufficient evidence of his plan of action \nto address his debts, despite being over four years since separating from his spouse. \nAlso, there is no evidence that he sought personal financial counseling to address his \nunique circumstances except for his divorce attorney trying to negotiate a settlement with \nhis spouse. \nBased on the record presented, I am not persuaded that Applicant\u2019s remaining \ndebts will be satisfactorily resolved. I also have not been presented with sufficient \nevidence showing Applicant\u2019s current financial status, ability to pay debts and expenses \nin a timely manner, and any formal personal financial counseling to assist him in avoiding \nfuture financial mistakes. As a result, and without more documentary evidence, I remain \ndoubtful about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. For \nthese reasons, none of the mitigating conditions fully apply to the SOR debts and his \noverall financial responsibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.o:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s \ndifficulties with his marital relationship and financial hardships that resulted. I also \nevaluated this case under the conditions in which a conditional clearance may be granted. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor, or to \nfurther inquire about financial matters. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. \n23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance is denied. \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

The 2019 credit bureau report, which reports the $906 charge off, reflects a \nzero balance; however, the 2020 credit bureau report reflects both a charge-off and \noutstanding balance of $906.

The \n2019 credit bureau report reflects that Applicant opened this account in 2011, and the \naccount was reported in 2019 with the notation that \u201cfirst payment [was] never \nreceived.\u201d Applicant stated in his Answer that he understood this debt would be forgiven \nafter the college lost a class action lawsuit.

(Items 1, 4-8) \nSOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.w and 1.x are for two medical accounts, placed for collection for \n$87 and $350, respectively. Applicant indicated during his background interview that \nboth medical bills stem from injuries he sustained in a 2018 motorcycle accident, in \nwhich he was hit by another driver. He received a settlement from the accident and was \nawaiting his attorney\u2019s instructions as to when to pay the associated medical bills. He \nwas unaware that any of the medical bills had been placed in collection. He indicated \nthat SOR \u00b6 1.x was reported on his credit report with Credit Karma, but SOR \u00b6 1.w was \nnot. He indicated that he would contact his attorney and pay any remaining outstanding \nmedical bills. (Items 1, 4-8) \nIn his Answer, Applicant stated that both medical debts were to be paid by a \nformer employer, from 2017 to 2018, for an on-the-job injury that was to be covered by \nworkers\u2019 compensation.

He also indicated that he made \nchanges since incurring these financial delinquencies, and he no longer uses credit \ncards. He indicated that he lived within his means and had no intention of having any \nfuture delinquent debts. He stated in his Answer that he would never risk his job to \nrepay a debt. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant had any financial \ncounseling. (Items 4, 8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d apply. Applicant was unable to pay his debts. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nhis financial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. Applicant failed to provide \nany documentation of his efforts to resolve his delinquent debts, or that any of his \ndelinquent debts had been resolved. There is no evidence that Applicant had any \nfinancial counseling. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.x: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

The past-due amounts and the balances increased from the July 2019 credit \nreport to the June 2020 credit report, but they decreased from the June 2020 credit \nreport to the March 2021 credit report, which indicates that Applicant is paying his child \nsupport and arrearages. His child support payments and arrearages are being \ngarnished from his pay checks. He is paying $717, $705, and $513 per month, for a \ntotal of $1,935 in monthly child support payments. The March 2021 credit report lists \none account as no longer past due. Applicant\u2019s oldest child is 18 years old and not \nattending college. His child support payments for that child continue to be paid at the \nsame rate, except they will be used to pay the arrearages, which will be paid quicker \nsince the whole payment is going to the arrearages. His two middle children turn 18 in \n2023.

Applicant could not afford to make a lump-sum \npayment, so he arranged for monthly payments of $250 to be automatically debited \nfrom his credit union account. He paid $100 in December 2020, then started monthly \npayments of $250.

Four medical debts \ntotaling about $1,385 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.q) are listed on the July 2019 credit report, but they \nare not listed on the two more recent credit reports.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ndischarge, child support arrearages, a charged-off auto loan, unpaid medical debts, and \ndelinquent consumer debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2005 divorce and the loss of \nincome after he quit a job in July 2016 that he had held since 2009. He did not agree \nwith the ethics and practices of the company\u2019s new management. His medical debts are \ncopayments for his children that his ex-wife failed to bring to his attention. He left his job \nvoluntarily, and his arrests had to have some effect on his finances. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems were only partially beyond his control. \nApplicant\u2019s child support payments are being garnished from his pay checks, \nwhich is standard in many child support cases. His monthly child support payments total \n$1,935. Applicant\u2019s oldest child is 18 years old and not attending college, which means \nthat his payments for that account should all go toward the arrearages. The March 2021 \ncredit report lists one account as no longer past due. \nApplicant paid or is paying the non-medical delinquent debts. His medical debts \nare a bit more difficult to decipher because they are not identified in the SOR by name \nor account number. He provided proof that he paid or is paying several medical debts, \nand the most recent credit report only lists four medical debts totaling about $1,385. \nApplicant asserted that his finances are currently not perfect, but he and his girlfriend \nare paying their debts. She has a job and contributes to the household\u2019s finances. He is \nworking a second job to help him pay his child support. \nApplicant has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made \na good-faith effort to pay his debts. His finances do not cast doubt on his current \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence, which is somewhat countered by his arrest history. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.q: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Since December 2019 Applicant has been employed as an IT technician \ncontractor at the same Marine Corps camp at which he served as a civilian police officer. \nWith contract changes, he is presently working in the same capacity at the same location \nfor a third company. He is seeking to retain his security clearance in relation to his \nemployment. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 16-19, 65; GE 1 at 11-12; GE 4 at 5.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a that in September 2018 there \nwas a probable cause determination was made that Applicant had committed three \ncrimes, specifically Obstruction of a Criminal Investigation, Attempt to Commit a \nConspiracy, and Supervising and Aiding a Prostitute. The SOR further alleged in this \nsubparagraph that Applicant\u2019s employment as a police officer with the U.S. Marine Corps \nwas terminated following that probable cause determination. \nIn his Answer Applicant denied having ever been involved in any criminal activity. \nHe wrote that there was \u201cno probable cause as I was never arrested or charged with any \ncrime.\u201d He noted that the investigation into his activities was dropped. He explained that \nhis civilian employment with the Marine Corps was terminated \u201cbecause I was a \nprobationary employee involved in a criminal investigation.\u201d (Answer at 1.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe Government cross-alleged in subparagraph 2.a the allegations set forth in \nsubparagraph 1.a. \nThe Government\u2019s Documentary Evidence \nOn September 12, 2018, the U.S. Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division \n(CID) initiated an investigation of Applicant following receipt of information that he had \ndirected his wife, a Marine Corps sergeant at the time, to delete text messages and other \nevidence on her personal cellphone to cover up her activities of soliciting herself for \nprostitution on a specialized \u201cdating:\u201d website (the Website). The CID coordinated its joint \ninvestigation of Applicant\u2019s wife and Applicant, with a Regional Special Assistant United \nStates Attorney (SAUSA) because Applicant worked as a civilian at the Camp. (GE 2 at \n2; GE 3 at 2.) \nThe CID investigated Applicant\u2019s wife for violations of the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice involving Pandering and Prostitution. The CID interviewed a Marine Corps \nsergeant (the Marine) who was a sex customer of Applicant\u2019s wife and identified her in a \nphotographic lineup. In an interview of a civilian at the Camp, the civilian reported to \ninvestigators that he overheard Applicant telling others that his \u201cwife goes on dates with \nrich men for extra money.\u201d After hearing this comment, the witness confronted Applicant. \nApplicant told him that his wife does not have sex for money on her \u201cdates\u201d so it was legal. \nThe CID also conducted a review of text messages between Applicant and his wife. Two \nof the messages discuss \u2018their infidelity.\u201d Other messages between Applicant and his wife \ncontain discussions about the wife\u2019s \u201cprostitution activities.\u201d (GE 3 at 2-13.) \nThe record includes a CID report, dated September 14, 2018, regarding a search \nof Applicant\u2019s cell phone, which revealed that he supervised his wife as she solicited \nherself for prostitution on the Website. The CID report also states that on September 14, \n2018, the SAUSA concluded that probable cause existed to believe that Applicant \ncommitted four Federal crimes in connection with these activities. The personnel security \ntracking system was updated to reflect that Applicant was the subject of a criminal \ninvestigation. In his August 27, 2021 response to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant \nconfirmed his separation from civilian employment at the Camp in September 2018 during \nhis probationary period due to \u201callegations of obstructing a criminal investigation, attempt \nto commit a conspiracy, and supervising or aiding a prostitute.\u201d (GE 2 at 2-3; GE 3 at 2; \nGE 4 at 2, 3.) \nA CID report, dated January 11, 2019, reflects that investigators interviewed the \nMarine, who had paid Applicant\u2019s wife $250 on two separate occasions \u201cfor her company \nwhich resulted in sexual intercourse.\u201d The Marine advised the CID investigators that \nApplicant met the Marine at the Marine\u2019s residence and advised that he and his wife had \nbeen questioned by CID investigators.

(GE 3 at 4, 13.) \nIn November 2019 the Marine Corps administratively separated in lieu of trial \n(SILT) Applicant\u2019s wife from the Marine Corps under Other Than Honorable (OTH) \nconditions. The CID investigation of Applicant\u2019s wife was closed on November 27, 2019, \nfollowing her SILT. All of her property seized during the investigation was returned to her. \nThe investigation of Applicant remained open pending \u201cthe adjudication of [Applicant.]\u201d \nOn January 6, 2020, the SAUSA determined that no action would be taken against \nApplicant, and the investigation was closed later that month. (Tr. at 28-29; GE 3 at 13, \n14-15, 16-17, 19, 21; GE 4 at 5.) \nDOHA Hearing Testimony \nApplicant learned that he was under investigation shortly before his civilian \nemployment with the Marine Corps was terminated in September 2018. He had learned \nthat his wife was under investigation for prostitution a few days before that. The \ninvestigation began after Applicant had a conversation with co-workers in which he \ndiscussed his wife going out on \u201cdates\u201d with rich men who paid for her company. The \ndates were arranged through the Website. She had been using the Website to arrange \ndates for a couple of months prior to the investigation. Applicant believes that his \nconversation with his co-workers was misinterpreted. (Tr. at 20-22, 26, 34.) \nApplicant admitted that he was aware that his wife advertised herself on the \nWebsite as available for paid \u201cdates.\u201d He denied, however, that he was aware that his \nwife was having sex with the men who paid her to go out on dates. Applicant spoke with \nthe Marine after Applicant became aware of the investigation. He testified that the Marine \ntold him that prior to his dates with Applicant\u2019s wife, there was no agreement that they \nwould have sex on their dates. The sexual intimacy just \u201chappened\u201d between \u201ctwo \nconsenting adults.\u201d Applicant claimed that he cannot remember how he learned about his \nwife\u2019s sexual activities with the Marine. He does recall asking the Marine not to talk to \ninvestigators if they asked to interview him. He wanted the Marine to keep the \u201cpersonal \nmatters\u201d between himself and Applicant\u2019s wife. Applicant had developed a friendship with \nthe Marine because Applicant found him to be \u201cvery respectful and just a man of great \nmoral character.\u201d The Marine was discharged from the Marine Corps under OTH \nconditions as a result of his patronizing prostitution from an active-duty Marine. Applicant \nremains in contact with the Marine once or twice a month through social media. (Tr. at \n22, 25-26, 32-34.) \nThe dating activity of Applicant\u2019s wife occurred during a period when, according to \nApplicant, the couple were \u201cin a financial bind.\u201d He claimed he took a large pay cut to \nbecome a police officer at the Camp. Applicant had previously worked as a car salesman \nand as a pizza delivery driver.

Applicant and his wife viewed the dating activity as \na way for his wife to earn extra cash by going out \u201cto dinners and get paid and make a \ncouple of hundred dollars an hour just to go out.\u201d The plan was for her to develop \u201cSugar \nBaby/Sugar Daddy\u201d relationships and earn money on the side of her duties as a Marine \nSergeant. Applicant testified that he had discussed this plan with his wife, and they agreed \nthat she would not engage in any \u201cintimacy.\u201d He claimed that restriction was specifically \nstated in her online profile on the Website. He testified, \u201cUnfortunately, one of these dates \nresulted in intimacy, and that\u2019s what landed us here.\u201d He claimed that he subsequently \nlearned that his wife had sex with other \u201cSugar Daddies\u201d during the period when she was \ngoing out on dates arranged through the Website. (Tr. at 22-26, 37; GE 1 at 12-13.) \nApplicant agreed that he asked his wife \u201cto delete text messages that had personal \nconversations.\u201d He denied, however, that he ever \u201csupervised [his wife] as she solicited \nherself online.\u201d He admitted that he approved or disapproved her dating specific men \nbecause he wanted her to limit her dating to older men to avoid a risk of \u201cattraction.\u201d He-\nalso admitted that he logged on to her webpage on the Website \u201cafter the fact, going \nthrough the conversations just to verify\u201d that she advised her clients that their dates would \nnot involve \u201cintimacy.\u201d (Tr. at 27-28.) \nApplicant agreed that a SAUSA had found probable cause to believe that Applicant \nhad committed certain crimes, which authorized the investigators to seize and conduct \nsearches of Applicant\u2019s electronic equipment, including his Smart Watch. Based upon \nthat finding of probable cause, the investigators also took DNA samples from Applicant \nand uploaded that to Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), the U.S National DNA \ndatabase maintained by the FBI. The investigators also took Applicant\u2019s fingerprints and \n\u201cmugshots,\u201d which were uploaded to the FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) \n(Tr. at 29-30, 59-60.) \nAt the time Applicant was terminated as a civilian police officer, he was just \ncompleting his two-year probationary period as a U.S. Navy employee. He appealed his \ntermination, but was unsuccessful. The SAUSA declined to prosecute Applicant for his \nconduct in relationship to his wife\u2019s prostitution activities. Applicant speculates that was \nbecause \u201ctheir probable cause wasn\u2019t strong enough.\u201d (Tr.at 30-32; GE 4 at 5.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife also testified. She served in the Marine Corps from 2010 to \nNovember 2019. She learned about the Website from another Marine. She discussed the \nidea with Applicant, and he agreed to her signing up on the Website to offer her services \nas a \u201cdate.\u201d Her Website profile did not explicitly mention sex. The discussions about sex \ncame up after she met her dates in person and they had spent some time together. She \nwas only on the Website \u201ca couple\u201d or \u201ca few months\u201d and had about five or six dates, \nthough she cannot remember a \u201chard number.\u201d She had ongoing relationships with two \nof her dates. On her other dates, she was typically paid about $200 plus some expenses. \nShe had sex with all of her dates, except the first one. After her first date, she \u201cstarted to \nrealize like - - okay, this is what it\u2019s really about.\u201d She claimed that all her husband knew \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas that she was \u201cgoing to hang out with a friend.\u201d She also testified that he was not \naware that she was having sex on her dates. (Tr. at 39-49.) \nThe investigators seized her cellphone as part of the investigation. At the hearing \nshe initially denied that her husband ever asked her to delete messages from her phone. \nShe said it all happened so quickly. She clarified her testimony by stating that she did not \nrecall him asking her to do so. She acknowledged that she did delete messages from her \nphone. (Tr. at 49-52.) \nMitigation \nAfter his termination from the Navy in 2018, Applicant began his studies in the field \nof IT Management. He was hired at the Camp as a Federal contractor. He claims that he \nhas \u201cexcelled\u201d in his new career and has been promoted twice and that his references \npraise his work and character. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 32-33, 35.) \nApplicant submitted four character reference letters. A former supervisor praised \nApplicant\u2019s integrity and work ethic. A co-worker from Applicant\u2019s current employment \ndescribed Applicant as honest and trustworthy. A third letter was written by the Marine, \nwho paid Applicant\u2019s wife for sexual services and was discharged from the Marine Corps. \nHe wrote that he spoke with Applicant after the Marine\u2019s activities with Applicant\u2019s wife \nbecame known through the CID investigation. The Marine believes that Applicant was not \naware of his wife\u2019s paid sexual activities before they were uncovered by the CID \ninvestigation. He wrote that his belief was corroborated by Applicant. The fourth reference \nletter was prepared by a friend and co-worker of Applicant, who then became Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor. He described Applicant as a reliable and dependable hard worker. (AE A \nthrough D.) \nApplicant also testified that he has been found eligible to be granted a permit to \ncarry a concealed weapon (CCW). He believes that this permit constitutes evidence of \nhis trustworthiness. There is no evidence in the record, however, as to what the standard \nis for a citizen in his state or county to obtain a CCW permit or the nature of the \ninvestigation into his background. Moreover, the record contains no evidence that the \nissuing authority was aware of and weighed Applicant\u2019s criminal actions in connection \nwith his wife\u2019s prostitution activities and the CID investigation. (Tr. at 64.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes a condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAs noted above, the Government is obligated to establish controverted facts such \nas those Applicant disputes in this case. The applicable standard of proof for the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d The Appeal Board has defined the term \n\u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance of the \nevidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-00496 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019). This standard is less \ndemanding that the probable cause standard applicable in criminal cases. Id. \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d \nstandard that Applicant engaged in criminal behavior because the evidence uncovered \nby the investigators was sufficient to establish the higher standard of probable cause for \nthe investigators to seize evidence and to take a DNA sample and fingerprints from \nApplicant. Accordingly, the record evidence establishes the above potentially \ndisqualifying condition. \nThis evidence shifts the burden to Applicant to establish mitigation. AG \u00b6 32 sets \nforth four mitigating conditions under Guideline J. The following three mitigating \nconditions have possible application to the facts in this case: \n(a) so much time has passed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. The criminal behavior did not \nhappen so long ago or under any unusual circumstances to support a conclusion that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. The fact that Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred when he was employed as \na U.S. Navy police officer raises serious questions about his judgment. \nApplicant claimed that he confronted the Marine about his sexual activity with \nApplicant\u2019s wife. He admitted at the hearing, however, that he asked the Marine to refuse \nto be interviewed by investigators. He also asked the Marine to keep his sexual activities \nwith Applicant\u2019s wife private as a personal matter. It is reasonable to conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s real purpose in meeting with the Marine was to obstruct the investigation of \nhis wife and himself, not to confront the Marine. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct of attempting \nto obstruct a criminal investigation seriously undercuts his credibility and shows poor \njudgment. \nThere is no reliable evidence that Applicant did not engage in the criminal behavior \nalleged in the SOR. Neither his testimony nor his wife\u2019s testimony regarding his lack of \nawareness of his wife\u2019s activities as a prostitute was credible. I base this credibility \nassessment upon the demeanor of both Applicant and his wife and the discrepancies in \nsome of the specifics of their testimony. Also, the reference letter from the Marine who \npaid for the wife\u2019s sexual services is inherently unreliable and untrustworthy. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence of rehabilitation is limited to his success in his new career in \nthe IT field. The absence of any criminal behavior in the record since the CID investigation \nclosed in 2020 carries limited weight since so little time has passed. Such evidence \nmerely means that no new investigations or charges have been brought against \nApplicant. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s failure to accept responsibility for his criminal conduct \nundercuts any claim of reform and rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 20-00331 at 8 (App. Bd. \nAug. 2, 2021). \nIt should be noted that the absence of criminal charges brought by the SAUSA \ndoes not preclude a finding that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct. ISCR Case No. \n17-00810 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019) (sustaining judge\u2019s finding that the applicant \nengaged in prostitution even though the citation was dropped). In DOHA proceedings, a \nfinding of criminal conduct can be made even if an applicant has not had criminal charges \nbrought against him. ISCR Case No. 02-00500 at 3, n.2 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2004). The \ndisqualifying condition quoted above specifically makes this point, stating that evidence \nof criminal conduct raises potentially disqualifying security concerns \u201cregardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(b). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that that individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes all of the above potentially disqualifying \nconditions. This evidence shifts the burden to Applicant to establish mitigation. AG \u00b6 17 \nincludes three conditions that could mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s \npersonal conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been established. Applicant\u2019s \noffenses were not minor, infrequent, or happened so long ago that they are unlikely to \nrecur and do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nApplicant has not taken any positive steps to reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. He has not even admitted his role in his wife\u2019s \ncriminal conduct. He also still associates with his wife by continuing his marriage and \nliving with her. Overall, he has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his \npersonal conduct or his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress resulting from \nthat conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Further comments are \nwarranted. Applicant seeks to deny charges of criminal conduct and inappropriate \npersonal conduct by stating that he was unaware that his wife\u2019s \u201cdating\u201d activities involved \npayments for having sex with the men she \u201cdated.\u201d His testimony generally and \nspecifically about his claimed lack of knowledge about her prostitution activities was not \ncredible. His actions reveal a serious lack of judgment. Moreover, he has not minimized \nthe potential for exploitation, coercion, or duress. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Items 1 \nthrough 4 were admitted into evidence, and are hereinafter referred to as Government \nExhibits 1 through 4. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 39 years old. He is separated from his spouse and has two minor \nchildren. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Vulnerability and Threat \nAnalyst. He is seeking to obtain eligibility for a public trust position in connection with \nhis employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, and has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 2001 to June 2004, \nand then in the Active Reserves from 2004 to 2009. Applicant first obtained a security \nclearance during his time in the military. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in May 2018. From about May \n2009 to about April 2019, Applicant has used marijuana with varying frequency. He \nstates that he has used marijuana six times over the past eleven years. Applicant \nstates that he has held a security clearance for almost twenty years now, and that he \nused marijuana while possessing a security clearance. \nIn April 2019, he used \nmarijuana in the form of edible gummies. He used marijuana to help him relax and \nsleep. Applicant indicated that his separation and pending divorce caused him to have \nproblems sleeping. Applicant seemingly used the marijuana as a coping mechanism. \nIn his security clearance application dated December 12, 2019, Applicant stated that, \u201cI \nsmoked pot while I was in between jobs.

DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to \nthe procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access to \ndetermination may be made. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the \nguidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant used marijuana for at \nleast a ten-year period, from 2009 to about April 2019, at times, while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. His actions are not mitigated. Applicant states that he is no longer \nusing marijuana. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information,\nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 17 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One of the conditions is potentially applicable: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.   \nApplicant used marijuana for many years, and while possessing a security \nclearance. The use of marijuana is in violation of Federal law. It is also against DoD \npolicies. \nApplicant is prohibited from using marijuana while holding a public trust \nposition.  His conduct shows poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a public trust position, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant has chosen to live his life to his \nconvenience, and has disregarded the law. Knowing that the use of marijuana is illegal, \nApplicant has disregarded the law and used it anyway. Applicant has engaged in \nconduct involving questionable judgment. \nUnder the particular facts of this case, \nApplicant does not show the requisite character or judgment of someone who has the \nmaturity, integrity, and reliability necessary to access classified information. At this \ntime, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a position of trust. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a public trust \nposition is expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not demonstrated \nthe level of maturity needed for access to sensitive information. Applicant served in the \nmilitary and held a security clearance during that time. \nHe understands the \nrequirements associated with holding a position of trust and knows that illegal drug use \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis not tolerated. \nApplicant is not an individual in whom the Government can be \nconfident to know that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, \neven when no one is looking. In this case, Applicant is not subject to random drug tests \nand so no one knows when he has marijuana in his system. This is dangerous and \nunacceptable. Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a public trust position. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and \noutstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with \nexplanations and clarifications. He claimed his income stream declined considerably \nbetween 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 after COVID hit and \u201cground his business \n(aerospace) to a halt,\u201d and severely limited his ability to pay his monthly expenses and \naddress his debts. With a substantially reduced salary, he encountered difficulties \nmeeting his household expenses and addressing his debts as well. He claimed that \neach of the accounts covered in the SOR remains delinquent. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 61-year-old engineering consultant of a defense contractor who \nseeks a security clearance.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n                                                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \n The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent \naccounts between 2019 and 2020 as the result of incurred heavy business and personal \nlosses. Applicant assumed personal responsibility for both his business and personally \nincurred debts. \nFinancial concerns \nCredit reports reveal that Applicant\u2019s three reported delinquent debts remain \nunaddressed and unresolved. These debt delinquencies warrant the application of two \nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligation.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted individual debts require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006).

He has been employed by a defense contractor as a \ncyber-intelligence analyst since September 2019. He reported being unemployed from \nJuly 2018 to October 2018 when funding for a new job was delayed. He averred in his \nAnswer that he was unemployed for an unknown period between 2008 and 2010, causing \nhim to lose a home to foreclosure, but did not provide details. He was married in 2008, \nseparated in 2016 and divorced in June 2021. He reported having a cohabitant since \n2019, which appears to be his current partner. He has three children with whom he shares \ncustody with his former spouse. He completed an associate\u2019s degree in 2012, and took \nadditional college courses from 2014 to 2015. He has never held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts that have been either placed for collection \nor have been charged off, totaling about $50,000, and a home foreclosure judgment in \n2010. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e, 1.k-1.m, and 1.u. He \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.f-1.j, and 1.n-1.t, with explanations. The evidence provided in \nthe FORM is reliable and sufficient to support the SOR allegations. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are creditor accounts totaling about $1,891. Applicant claimed \nin his Answer that he is in the process of paying off these debts, but he noted that they \nare no longer active accounts on his credit report. However, both accounts appear on \nApplicant\u2019s January 5, 2021 credit report as accounts in collection.

Applicant \nnoted in his Answer that he is in the process of paying the debts in full. All three accounts \nappear on Applicant\u2019s January 5, 2021 credit report as past-due accounts that have been \ncharged off. There has been insufficient evidence presented to show that these accounts \nhave been or are likely to be resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.j are collection agency accounts totaling about $5,539. Applicant \nsubmitted sufficient documentation to show that these accounts have been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l are bank credit accounts totaling about $2,738.

Applicant has shown that he \nhas budgeted to pay the auto loan in monthly installments under an agreement with the \ncreditor. His agreement shows the loan went to a final judgment on February 16, 2021, \nand he owes $31,904. Installments were to begin on June 1, 2021, and he was to pay \n$500 per month. He claims that he has begun those monthly payments, but did not \nprovide sufficient documentary evidence of payments made. Although Applicant may in \nfact be paying this debt as he stated, there is insufficient evidence that it is being \nsatisfactorily resolved through a record of regular and consistent monthly payments over \na sufficient period of time to show a willingness and intent to complete the plan. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.p, and 1.s are credit accounts and a collection account totaling about \n$2,714. Applicant has provided sufficient evidence that these debts have been \nsatisfactorily resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.r, and 1.t are credit accounts totaling $1,334. Applicant claimed in \nhis Answer that he is in the process of paying off these debts, however he noted that they \nare no longer active accounts on his credit report. There has been insufficient evidence \npresented to show that these accounts have been or are likely to be resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.u is a home foreclosure and final judgment in 2010. Applicant stated that \nhe purchased the home in 2008 just before the recession. He claims he lost his job and \nwas unable to make payments on the mortgage. He has not provided sufficient evidence \nto show the circumstances of this mortgage default and foreclosure, to include records \nrelated to payments and deficiencies on the mortgage, the extent of his unemployment, \nhis financial situation at the time, attempt to resolve the debt under mortgage recovery \nplans being offered at the time, attempts to sell the home before defaulting, or other \nmeasures to avoid foreclosure and judgment. \nThe record suggests that he generally had not made significant efforts to address \nhis debts until 2020 and 2021, apparently after being interviewed by a government \ninvestigator in May 2020. In his personal subject interview from May 2020, Applicant \nstated that his financial problems began between 2015 and 2018. He separated from his \nspouse and lost a job. He went from a dual income earning $80,000 to earning $48,000 \nper year. He applied for a loan consolidation in 2017 or 2018, but it was disapproved. \nApplicant now earns about $160,000 per year, and has been fully employed since 2010 \nexcept for a few months of unemployment from a company job offer not being fulfilled. He \nstated that he is \u201cattacking his debts.\u201d \nApplicant stated that he is following the rules of a nationally recognized money \nmanagement advisor and accounting for \u201cevery cent of each paycheck,\u201d but he provided \nno indication of formal financial counseling or completion of a program that addresses his \nunique situation. Additionally, his budget documents do fully indicate assets, debts, and \npayments besides recurring expenses and his $500 allocation apparently toward the auto \ndebt mentioned above. He provided a final judgment of dissolution of marriage, but not \nthe marriage settlement agreement or the family law financial affidavit mentioned in the \nagreement.

He noted in his Answer that \nhe and his current partner have used stimulus checks and tax refunds to pay off debts \nusing the \u201csnowball\u201d system from a nationally known financial advisor. They no longer \nuse credit cards and have an emergency fund. He noted that they paid his partner\u2019s debts \nfirst. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and documentary evidence in the record are sufficient to \nestablish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant claims to have incurred most of his debts as a result of his contentious \nrelationship with his ex-spouse. His unresolved debts are numerous, long-standing, \nrecent, and continuing financial concerns. Additionally, his overall financial responsibility \nhas been significantly impugned, and his current financial status has not satisfactory \naccounted for his past behavior. \nAlthough his financial condition may have been compromised by his former \nspouse\u2019s actions, he has not shown sufficient evidence to support improper or \nunauthorized financial activity, or efforts to resolve his debts over the years. Applicant did \nnot take significant actions to resolve his delinquent debts until after he was interviewed \nby a government investigator. An applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy \nbefore resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to \nclassified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) Applicant also \nhas promised to resolve his auto debt through an installment plan, but this debt was \nreduced to a judgment before he agreed to make payments, and he has not presented a \nsufficient track record of consistent and reliable payments to persuade me that it will be \nresolved. Applicant also stated that he would resolve other debts in the future. However, \na promise to resolve delinquent debts in the future is not a substitute for a track record of \npaying debts in a timely manner or otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. \nISCR Case No. 17-04110 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nApplicant stated that he is working on debt resolution by following a well-know \nfinancial advisor\u2019s plans. This is laudable and may be acceptable in certain situations, \nhowever, Applicant has not shown sufficient evidence of his plan of action to address his \nremaining debts, except for a budget, or that he sought personal financial counseling to \naddress his unique circumstances. \nBased on the record presented, I am not persuaded that Applicant\u2019s remaining \ndebts will be satisfactorily resolved. I also have not been presented with sufficient \nevidence showing Applicant\u2019s current financial status, ability to pay debts and expenses \nin a timely manner, and any formal or personal financial counseling to assist him in \navoiding future financial mistakes. He may be on the way to turning his financial life \naround; and he made significant efforts to address some of his debts, but insufficient \nevidence of financial responsibility was presented. As a result, and without more \ndocumentary evidence, I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. For these reasons, none of the mitigating conditions \nfully apply to the unresolved debts and his overall financial responsibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s \ndifficulties with his marital relationship, and financial hardships that resulted. I also \nevaluated this case under the conditions in which a conditional clearance may be granted. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor, or to \nfurther inquire about financial matters. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. \n23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e; 1.k-1.m; 1.q-1.r; 1.t-1.u: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.j; 1.n-1.p; 1.s: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance is denied. \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Items 2, 3) \nThe collection agent for the loan account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b obtained a $4,628 \njudgment against Applicant in about May 2019. Applicant reached a settlement with the \ncollection agent to resolve the debt via a lump sum payment of $2,812, which he paid in \nDecember 2020. He derived the funds for the payment from a $2,380 employment bonus \nand savings. In 2020, he created a \u201csmall emergency spending fund\u201d savings account to \nwhich he contributed funds from his \u201cincreased earnings\u201d and the decreased expenses \nthat stemmed from \u201cstaying at home more due to COVID-19\u201d and \u201coverall lifestyle \nchanges.\u201d The record did not indicate the amount of his contributions or the balance of \nthe savings account. Applicant\u2019s October 2021 credit report showed the loan account with \na $0 balance. This debt has been resolved. (Items 2, 3) \nApplicant and his ex-wife jointly financed the purchase of a vehicle during their \nmarriage for her primary use. After the divorce court initially assigned his wife \nresponsibility for making the loan payments, she surrendered the vehicle as part of her \nChapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings and received a discharge of the loan in December \n2018. The lender sold the vehicle at auction and charged-off the $17,000 deficiency \nbalance, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The divorce court ordered the parties to \u201cequally satisfy\u201d \nany deficiency balance. In his SOR answer, Applicant stated that he planned to negotiate \na payment plan to resolve the full amount of this debt since his ex-wife has been unwilling \nto satisfy this debt \u201cwithout further court involvement.\u201d His October 2021 credit report \nindicated no change in the alleged balance on this loan account. This debt remains \nunresolved. (Items 2 \u2013 4, 6 \u2013 8) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is a credit-card account with a delinquent balance \nof $18,695 that the creditor charged off in about May 2019. Applicant has been paying \n$187 per month towards this debt since at least August 2019. Although this debt is not \nyet resolved, the reduced balance of $13,646 on Applicant\u2019s October 2021 credit report \nshows that he has been complying with the payment plan. (Items 2 \u2013 8) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is a credit-card account with a delinquent balance \nof $12,911 that the creditor charged off in about May 2019. Applicant has been paying \n$130 per month towards this debt since at least June 2019. Although this debt is not yet \nresolved, the reduced balance of $9,271 on Applicant\u2019s October 2021 credit report shows \nthat he has been complying with the payment plan. (Items 2 \u2013 8) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a credit-card account with a delinquent balance \nof $5,409 that the creditor charged off on a date not indicated in the record. Applicant \nestablished a plan to pay $200 per month towards this debt in December 2020. He made \nthe payments from December 2020 through February 2021. However, he missed the \nMarch through May 2021 payments due to an inadvertent debit-card issue. He \nreestablished the payment plan in June 2021. Although this debt is not yet resolved, the \nreduced balance of $3,997 on Applicant\u2019s October 2021 credit report shows that he has \nbeen complying with the payment plan.

The loan became delinquent once his \nex-wife stopped contributing to the monthly payments after relocating to State B following \ntheir separation. Applicant initiated action through the lender\u2019s mortgage assistance \nprogram to save the home from foreclosure, but the lender only offered him the option to \nmake a lump-sum payment of $8,000, which he stated he could not afford. Despite his \nefforts, he was unable to sell the home in time to avoid the December 2018 foreclosure. \nApplicant never received any statements or other information from the lender following \nthe foreclosure. In June 2019, the house sold at auction for an amount Applicant believed \nexceeded the amount he owed on the loan at the time of the foreclosure. In response to \nthe SOR, Applicant contacted the lender who advised that there was a $0 balance \noutstanding on the loan account and provided a December 2020 statement corroborating \nsame. Applicant disputed the account with the credit bureau agencies. In January 2021, \none of the agencies confirmed the account but reported it as closed with a $0 balance. \nApplicant\u2019s October 2021 credit report also showed a $0 balance on the loan account. \nThis debt has been resolved. (Items 2 \u2013 4, 6 \u2013 8) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to the tumultuous period in his life \nbetween about 2017 and 2019, when he and his ex-wife were separated and divorcing. \nTheir divorce proceedings were complicated by the fact that they were held in his wife\u2019s \nnew state of residence (State B) while Applicant remained in State A, by a protracted \ncustody battle, and by their strained relationship. The financial impact of this period \nincluded litigation-related fees (including for his own attorney and a guardian ad litem he \nhired to represent his children\u2019s interests), travel costs, court-ordered child and spousal \nsupport, and employment income loss. Applicant stopped working between July and \nOctober 2017 due to the impact the divorce was having on his ability to focus at work. \n(Items 2 \u2013 4) \nApplicant\u2019s employment income was $151,600 annually as of December 2019. He \npaid $1,650 per month for child support from November 2017 through June 2019. His \nchild support order ended after he was awarded primary residential custody of the \nchildren. He does not receive any child support from his ex-wife. He has paid $1,000 per \nmonth for spousal support since June 2017, and $1,084 per month since June 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s recent credit report revealed no new delinquent debts.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG.

An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). Having considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could \nmitigate the concern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant made meaningful progress in addressing the delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR. He resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and has consistently \nmade monthly payments to resolve those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.f. He \nestablished a reasonable basis to dispute the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, and took action \nto resolve the issue. His recent credit report demonstrates that he lives within his means, \nis managing his current finances responsibly, and has not incurred any new delinquent \ndebts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered that Applicant did not resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 1.f until after the date the SOR was issued, and has not yet resolved the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. However, the record establishes that he acted responsibly to address his \nindebtedness in light of circumstances surrounding his separation and divorce that were \nbeyond his control. Moreover, the actions he took, both before and after the SOR was \nissued, demonstrate a track record of responsible action that leads me to conclude that \nhe will follow through with his plans to resolve his remaining delinquent debts. \nThe AGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each and every \ndebt alleged in the SOR, or to be debt free. Applicant has implemented a plan to resolve \nhis financial problems and he has made substantial progress implementing his plan. \nGiven the responsible manner in which Applicant has addressed his delinquent debts, I \nconclude that his finances are under control, unlikely to recur, and no longer cast doubt \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and \n20(e) apply to mitigate the Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nor continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She \nhas been offered a position contingent on holding a security clearance. That \ngovernment contractor is sponsoring her for a clearance. She has had intermittent \nemployment since she was medically retired from the U.S. Army in 2016. She held the \nrank of major when she was retired. She receives retirement pay from the Army of \n$1,400 monthly and a disability pension from the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs (VA) \nof $692 monthly, based upon a 40 percent VA disability rating. She holds a master\u2019s \ndegree. She recently married and has no children. (Tr. at 19, 24; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file her 2013-2017 federal income \ntax returns. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nApplicant admitted the single allegation in her SOR answer. She provided a \nvariety of reasons why she was unable to timely file her federal tax returns for years \n2013-2017. Those reasons include: she was either performing duties as an Army \nreservist or placed on active duty orders, which created pay/tax issues for her; she \nrented her house out half the year, which caused tax issues; in April 2014, tax filing time \nfor tax year 2013, she was assigned to a task force requiring her to work 15-18 hours a \nday so she did not have the time to file her taxes, but she did file for a six-month filing \nextension; her tax records were stored at her home in a different state and she had little \nopportunity to access them; she had medical issues involving the functioning of her \nbrain, a condition which was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis, which ultimately led \nto her medical retirement from the Army in 2016; she was homeless for approximately \n18 months staying with friends on occasion. (Tr. 21-24, 42-43) \nApplicant received a lump-sum payment of approximately $197,000 from a family \ntrust fund in 2016 or 2017. She did not use this money to hire an accountant or tax \nprofessional to prepare her unfiled federal returns from 2013-2017. She claimed to \ninterview several certified public accountants about her situation, but she asserted that \ndespite the lump sum payment, she could not afford to pay any of them a fee of \n$10,000.

She stated that \nin 2017-2018, she received some financial counseling assistance from a group that \nworks with military veterans. (Tr. 24, 26, 28-29, 60-61) \nIn April 2019, Applicant completed interrogatories sent by DCSA CAF \nadjudicators. As part of her response, she provided wage and income transcripts \nobtained by her from the IRS for tax years 2013-2017. At that time, she had not filed her \nfederal returns for those years. She stated in her response, \u201cI hope to have all returns \nfinished by December, including 2018.\u201d Presumably, her reference to December meant \nDecember 2019. She did not file her federal returns by her hopeful deadline. (GE 2) \nAs stated above, the SOR was issued to Applicant in February 2021. She \ntestified that she hired a tax attorney/CPA to file all of her unfiled federal returns from \n2013-2020. Applicant admitted she did not timely file her federal returns for years 2018-\n2020. Since the unfiled tax returns for those years were not alleged in the SOR, I will \nnot use that evidence for disqualification purposes, but I may use it to assess credibility, \nfor the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and in considering the whole-person \nfactors. Applicant presented documentation showing that her 2013 federal return was \nfiled in August 2022 (AE F); her 2014-2016 returns were filed in November 2021 (AE E, \npp. 1, 44, 89); and her 2017 return was filed in August 2022 (AE G).  \nApplicant testified that she did not deliberately refuse to file her federal tax \nreturns. She needed help with the task and did not get it. He medical issues impacted \nher ability to complete her taxes. (Tr. 32-34, 49) \nApplicant provided character letters from five colleagues and former supervisors, \nincluding two retired Army major generals. All of her references state that Applicant is \ntrustworthy and reliable based upon their personal knowledge of her. They all seem to \nplace the responsibility on the Army for not providing Applicant the proper means to \ntransition out of the service with her medical problems. This they believe ultimately led \nto her tax problems. All recommend that her clearnce be continued. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and documentary evidence establish that she failed to \ntimely file her 2013-2017 federal tax returns. I find the above disqualifying condition is \nraised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nWhen a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how \nlong an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax \nreturns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete \nmaking payments. The Appeal Board's emphasis on security concerns arising from tax \ncases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016 (reversing \ngrant of security clearance and stating, \"His delay in taking action to resolve his tax \ndeficiency for years and then taking action only after his security clearance was in \njeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not \nreflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted \nwith the nation's secrets.\"); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of \ncircumstances beyond applicant's control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax \nliens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant's wages, and emphasizing the \napplicant's failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, \nand insufficient discussion of Applicant's efforts to resolve tax liens). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant stated that there were a number of reasons why she was unable to file \nher federal tax returns for 2013-2017 in a timely manner. While several of those \ncircumstances were beyond her control, e.g. her medical issues and her medical \nretirement, some of them were not. She had the financial resources when she received \nher lump-sum trust fund payment of almost $200,000 in 2016-2017 to hire a \nprofessional to complete her federal tax returns. She chose not to do so. She also failed \nto inquire about seeking tax assistance from the military tax assistance offices. She \nfinally acted to hire a tax professional in 2021 who filed her missing returns in either \nJune 2021 or August 2022, after the SOR had issued. Applicant\u2019s actions do not \namount to responsible actions under the circumstances. While it appears Applicant\u2019s \nmissing 2013-2017 tax returns are all filed, they are all at least four years late and as \nmuch as eight years late. Additionally, she continued her pattern of failing to timely file \nher federal returns after 2017. Her non-filing and delay in filing shows a lack of \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s medical issues that hampered her filing her tax returns, \nher medical retirement, her personal difficulties in accessing her tax records, and her \ngood character evidence. However, her lack of priority in handling her tax issues over a \nmulti-year period causes me to question her trustworthiness, reliability, and good \njudgment, and thus, her eligibility for access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 82, 112) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges in about August 2009, Applicant was charged with DUI. He \nclaimed he drank four drinks over about a three-hour period at a party.

(Tr. 84, 93) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges in about March 2013, Applicant was charged with DUI. Applicant \nclaimed that he drank two to five beers at a friend\u2019s residence over a five-hour period, \nand then he elected to drive a friend home before going to his own home. (Tr. 85-86, 123) \nThe police stopped Applicant because he was blocking an intersection. (Tr. 86) Applicant \nwas stopped in the intersection because he was unsure about which way to turn. (Tr. 86) \nHe was arrested for DUI, but not charged with DUI. (Tr. 90) He refused a breathalyzer \neven though he was aware that he should have metabolized one beer per hour and not \nbeen intoxicated by the time the police stopped him. (Tr. 123-124) He was also aware \nthat the refusal of a breathalyzer would result in suspension or revocation of his driver\u2019s \nlicense, and the refusal would be admissible in a DUI trial.

(Tr. 92-93) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges in about May 2017, Applicant was charged with Operating a \nVehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol (OUI). He claimed that he went to dinner \nand had three, maybe four drinks over about a three-hour period. (Tr. 39, 95, 125) The \npolice stopped him possibly for swerving while driving; he refused a breathalyzer; and he \nwas arrested for OUI.

(Tr. 95) He was charged with OUI Second \nOffense. (AE N (arraignment)) He pleaded guilty to OUI First Offense. (file) He received \na fine of $1,250. In November 2017, he completed a 24-hour class over a weekend and \nlearned about alcohol consumption. (Tr. 40-47, 96-97; AE B; AE F) He abstained from \nalcohol consumption from May to November 2017. (Tr. 41, 53) No incident report from \nhis security record concerning the 2017 OUI was offered as an exhibit at his hearing. (Tr. \n102) \nApplicant admitted he had a problem with alcohol consumption, and it is a \u201clifelong \nissue\u201d for him. (Tr. 43, 49, 63) He described himself as a \u201crecovering alcoholic.\u201d (Tr. 63) \nHe decided to limit his alcohol consumption after November 2017 to two standard drinks \nin an evening. (Tr. 49, 51-52, 165-166) He claimed he has only consumed about 20 drinks \nin the last year, or perhaps it was 24 or 25 drinks. (Tr. 50, 62) He typically drinks no more \nthan three beers in a weekend or possibly two or four drinks in a month. (Tr. 50-51, 53, \n105; SOR response \u00b6 39) He may not drink anything for a month. (Tr. 105) He has not \nbecome intoxicated since 2017. (Tr. 53) He most recently consumed alcohol a month \nbefore his hearing, and on that occasion, he drank one beer. (Tr. 102-103) \nApplicant occasionally reviews the workbook he received from his alcohol-related \nclass in 2017 to reinforce and refresh what he learned about limiting his alcohol \nconsumption. (Tr. 60, 66, 97; AE F) He understands the risks of excessive alcohol \nconsumption and believes he will not engage in excessive alcohol consumption in the \nfuture. (Tr. 66) In June 2021, he moved overseas, and attendance at alcohol counseling \nor classes was difficult. (Tr. 100) He attended two sessions over the Internet about alcohol \nconsumption in 2021 after he received the SOR. (Tr. 61, 97-98) Those two sessions are \nthe only counseling or treatment he has received for alcohol since 2017. (Tr. 65) He never \nhad a one-on-one session where an alcohol or medical counselor reviewed his history of \nalcohol consumption. (Tr. 128) He was never advised that his history warranted a \nrecommendation of abstinence from alcohol consumption. (Tr. 128)  \nApplicant has never been diagnosed with alcohol dependence or alcohol use \ndisorder. (Tr. 113) He exercises to reduce stress. (Tr. 54, 62) He has not engaged in any \nquestionable conduct after 2017. (Tr. 110) His support group is his girlfriend and a close \nfriend. (Tr. 64) He does not drive after consuming alcohol.

(AE G) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nTwo alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) provide: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established. The SOR alleges four alcohol-related \nincidents involving the police and courts. Applicant was arrested in 2007, 2009, 2013, and \n2017 for alcohol-related driving offenses. In his 2009 DUI, his test indicated a .23 percent \nBAC. He refused to consent to a BAC test for the other three arrests. Although the term \n\u201cbinge\u201d drinking is not defined in the Directive, his BAC for the 2009 DUI is high enough \nto establish Applicant engaged in binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired \njudgment. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFour alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-23(d) are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and \nis making satisfactory progress; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization \nand has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information.

See AG \u00b6 \n23(b). \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant attended two \nalcohol-related sessions over the Internet in 2021; however, he had relapses after \nprevious classes, and he is not currently \u201cparticipating in a counseling or treatment \nprogram.\u201d See AG \u00b6 23(c). He did not provide a written \u201cfavorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member \nof a recognized alcohol treatment program.\u201d See AG \u00b6 23(d). \nApplicant claimed at his hearing that he drank four drinks over about a three-hour \nperiod at a party in 2009. He said he did not remember the BAC test result, but finally \nsaid it could have been a .2. The OPM ROI indicates his BAC was .23 percent. Applicant \nhad a right to refuse to consent to tests for BACs when he was arrested for DUI; however, \nthose refusals leave me without evidence to corroborate his claimed low levels of alcohol \nconsumption. His erroneous description of his alcohol consumption for his DUI in 2009 \ncasts doubt on the credibility of his description at his hearing of his current alcohol \nconsumption. Absent a credible, persuasive description of alcohol consumption, there is \nno assurance that Applicant is currently consuming alcohol responsibly. AG \u00b6 23(b) is not \nfully established in this instance. \nAfter careful consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption, I have continuing doubts \nabout the risks of poor decisions after excessive alcohol consumption. It is too soon to \nconclude alcohol-related incidents involving the police and courts or compromise of \nclassified information are unlikely to recur. Not enough time has elapsed without alcohol-\nrelated misconduct to eliminate doubt about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Alcohol consumption concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline G are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior avionics acquisition and integration analyst. He \nworked for DOD contractors from 2008 to present. In 2015, he received a master\u2019s \ndegree. He honorably served in the Army from 1986 to 2008 and overseas in Republic of \nKorea, Iraq, and Afghanistan. He had an exemplary Army career, rising to the rank of \nCW4 and being on the promotion list for CW5. His highest award is a meritorious service \nmedal. He has five air medals for flying missions in combat zones. His frequent and \nlengthy deployments had an adverse effect on his family life, and he made significant \nsacrifices on his nation\u2019s behalf over his many years of service on active duty and as a \ncontractor. There is no evidence of security violations or abuse of illegal drugs. \nThe evidence against grant of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is more \npersuasive at this time. Applicant has four alcohol-related driving offenses in 2007, 2009, \n2013, and 2017. He refused tests for BAC for three of the arrests and consented to a test \nin 2009 which resulted in a BAC result of .23. He initially claimed that he only consumed \nabout one beer per hour for four hours before the 2009 DUI arrest. This claim damaged \nhis credibility, and his assertions of responsible alcohol consumption are not accepted \nwithout corroboration. He is not participating in an alcohol counseling or treatment \nprogram, and he did not provide a written \u201cfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program.\u201d See AG \u00b6 23(d). The DUIs did not happen under unusual \ncircumstances, future alcohol-related incidents are likely to recur and continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

(GE 2, 3; Tr. 40-49) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was fired from certain jobs, failed to provide the \ncorrect dates when she was employed by different employers, failed to disclose she was \nterminated or fired from certain jobs, and deliberately failed to provide accurate \ninformation to the government investigator about the discrepancies in her SCAs until she \nwas confronted with the facts. \nIn February 2014, Applicant was fired from her employment at CC due to \nattendance issues and was not eligible for rehire (SOR \u00b6 1.d). She worked for CC from \nFebruary 2012 to February 2014. In her 2016 SCA, she disclosed she was employed by \nCC from May 2007 to February 2014.

She testified that she had several managers while at CC and she had \nhealth issues which resulted in her attendance issues. She explained she came to work \none day and the manager immediately asked her to come to the back office and told her \nshe was terminated due to attendance. Her explanation for failing to disclose the \ninformation on her 2020 SCA was that she thought she had disclosed it on her original \nSCA and it had repopulated when she completed the 2020 SCA. She said it was a mistake \nfor not ensuring the SCA was accurate. (GE 1, 2, 4, 5; Tr. 89-96, 109-113) \nIn December 2016, Applicant was fired from her employment at AP and was not \neligible for rehire (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant disclosed in her 2016 SCA that she was hired by \nAP in October 2016 and worked for them to the present, which was December 1, 2016, \nthe date of the SCA. (Tr. 78-80; GE 3) \nApplicant testified that she had been hired at AP and was terminated for failing to \nshow up for her assignment. She stated she did not recall being terminated at that time. \nShe testified that several months later, she reapplied for a job at AP and was told she \nwas not eligible because she had failed to show up previously and had been terminated. \nShe said this is when she learned she had been terminated earlier. (Tr. 80-87) \nIn her 2018 SCA, she disclosed that she had been hired by AP in October 2016 \nand left in June 2017. AP provided substitute or temporary workers for different jobs. In \nher 2018 SCA she stated \u201cI worked [at] different location[s]. Filled teachers absent at \ndifferent school.\u201d (GE 2). She listed the reason for leaving was, \u201cDid not provide enough \npromising hours.\u201d She did not disclose she was fired. (GE 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2020 SCA, she did not disclose her employment with AP. In Section \n13C, which asked about employment that had not previously been disclosed, if she had \nbeen fired, she responded \u201cNo.\u201d During the background interview, she told the \ninvestigator that she had worked for AP from October 2016 to June 2017, and she left \nbecause she was not getting enough hours to work. The investigator confronted her with \nthe dates AP provided regarding her employment, which were from November 29, 2016, \nto December 5, 2016, and that she had been terminated. She explained to the investigator \nthat she was terminated due to not fulfilling the job duty. She further explained that she \ndid not disclose the termination because she was rehired by AP in error. At her hearing, \nshe testified that she did not recall being terminated until she reapplied for a position with \nAP three or four months after she first applied. She said she was with AP for a couple of \nmonths. This is contrary to their records.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that \nApplicant was fired by two employers and not eligible for rehire and was fired by another \ntwo employers for unfavorable employment or conduct. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose on her August 2020 SCA her firing from CC (SOR \u00b6 1.d) that was alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e. Her explanation for failing to disclose the information on her 2020 SCA was she \nthought she had disclosed it on her original SCA and that it had repopulated when she \ncompleted the 2020 SCA. She did disclose her employment with CC on her 2016 SCA. \nThe 2016 version of the SCA did not ask if she had been terminated or fired. Applicant \ncompleted a Declaration of Federal Employment form in November 2016. In the \ndeclaration she disclosed she had been terminated by CC in February 2014. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e also alleged that she deliberately failed to disclose in her August 2020 \nSCA that she was fired from AP. In December 2016, Applicant was fired from her \nemployment at AP and was not eligible for rehire (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant disclosed on her \n2016 SCA that she was hired by AP in October 2016 and worked for them to the present, \nwhich was December 1, 2016, the date of the SCA. (GE 5) \nApplicant testified that she was terminated by AP for failing to show up for her \nassignment. She testified that several months later she learned she was terminated. In \nher 2018 SCA, she disclosed that she had been hired by AP in October 2016 and left in \nJune 2017, because the job did not provide enough promising hours. In response to \nsection 13C, which asked if she had been fired from any employment not previously \nreported, she stated \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 2) In Applicant\u2019s 2020 SCA, she did not disclose her \nemployment with AP. In Section 13C, which asked about employment that had not \npreviously been disclosed, if she had been fired, she responded \u201cNo.\u201d During the \nbackground interview, she told the investigator that she had worked for AP from October \n2016 to June 2017, and she left because she was not getting enough hours to work. The \ninvestigator confronted her with the dates AP provided regarding her employment, which \nwere from November 29, 2016, to December 5, 2016, and that she had been terminated. \nI did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. I find that she deliberately failed to disclose \nher termination from AP and the correct period of time she worked there in her 2020 SCA. \nI further find that she intentionally provided false information to the investigator on why \nshe left that employment. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j) \nI also find that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts in her April 2018 SCA \nby failing to disclose she had been fired by BB due to unfavorable conduct (SOR \u00b6 1. f). \nI find she also deliberately falsified material facts during her January 2, 2019 interview \nwith a government investigator when she told the investigator the reason she left BB \nemployment was because she found a better job, when in fact she had been fired for her \nconduct by putting WD-40 on chips and potentially harming another employee.

Because it was for a relatively short period of time and she was not \nterminated, I find she did not deliberately falsify this information on her 2016 and 2018 \nSCA. I find for her on SOR \u00b6 1.k. However, with regard to her period of employment \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l, I find she deliberately failed to provide the accurate dates. There is \na considerable discrepancy between what she disclosed (May 2007 to February 2014) \nand the period she was actually employed (February 2012 to February 2014), and the \nfact that she was terminated from employment. \nI find none of the disqualifying conditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c and 1.d. \nApplicant was terminated or fired from these jobs due to attendance issues or not \ncompleting the job satisfactorily. This is not the type of personal conduct that raises \nsecurity concerns. I find the above disqualifying conditions apply to the remaining \nallegations. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. I have considered whether Applicant\u2019s \nactions were due to carelessness or were deliberate. I understand the difficulty in \nproviding dates of employment when the person has multiple jobs over an extended \nperiod of time. The concern is that Applicant obviously was aware that she was terminated \nfrom certain jobs and it is about those jobs that she failed to provide accurate information. \nApplicant did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the omissions and \nfalsifications before being confronted. She was given an opportunity to do so when she \nwas interviewed by a government investigator, but failed to do so. Failing to be honest on \nan SCA and when interviewed by a government investigator is not minor. She repeatedly \nfailed to disclose accurate information about derogatory information from her past. I \ncannot find her actions happened under unique circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nHer conduct casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose information in her SCAs and provide \ntruthful responses to a government investigator raises serious concerns. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.k:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",
