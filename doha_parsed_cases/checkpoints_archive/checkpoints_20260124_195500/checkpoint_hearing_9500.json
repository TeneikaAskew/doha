Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on July 12, 2007, and again on March 9, 2009, to request a security clearance \nrequired as part of his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results \nof the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nand Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn May 5, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Item \n1) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 17, 2009. He signed a notarized Answer on \nJune 1, 2009, and requested a decision without a hearing. In his Answer, Applicant \nadmitted to all allegations in the SOR. On July 21, 2009, DOHA Department Counsel \nsubmitted a file of relevant materials (FORM) in support of the government\u2019s preliminary \ndecision to deny Applicant's request to be granted a security clearance. The FORM \ncontained six documents, identified as Items 1 through 6. The FORM and attached \nItems were forwarded to Applicant on July 22, 2009, and he received the package on \nAugust 6, 2009. Applicant was given 30 days from the date he received the FORM to \nrespond. He timely responded to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 3, 2009, for an administrative decision based on the record. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nrelating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The request, along with 15 documents \npertaining to the PRC, are included in the FORM as Items I through XV. The facts \nadministratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not \nsubject to reasonable dispute and are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 36 years old, joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1992 and attained the \nrank of sergeant. He completed a security clearance application in 1996 (Item 6) and \nheld a Secret clearance starting in 1997. He was honorably discharged in 2005. He has \nbeen employed by a defense contractor since that time, holding the position of technical \ncontroller. His job requires him to live overseas and, since 2005, he has lived in the \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) (Items 4, 6). \n \nIn April 2005, Applicant met a Chinese woman at a bar in the UAE. They had \nwhat he describes as a \u201cone-night stand\u201d the night they met. He returned to the bar in \norder to meet her again. During two of their encounters, he paid her for sex. \u201cAt his \nbehest, their dating ended up leading to cohabitation\u2026\u201d in May or June 2005. Several \nmonths later, she informed Applicant that she was married and her husband was in \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nChina. She stated that he abused her and she came to the UAE to get away from him \nand to find employment. She left her daughter in China with her husband and mother. \nShe obtained a divorce in November 2006 (Item 5). \n \n \nAfter Applicant and the woman began living together, she did not work as a \nprostitute, and she has told him that she was not a prostitute. She is no longer \nemployed outside the home. Several of her friends, who are prostitutes, have visited \nthem at their home. Applicant has encouraged her to dissociate herself from these \nfriends. Applicant informed his on-site supervisor and program manager about his \nrelationship. He did not inform the company security officer of his cohabitation with a \nforeign national until September 2006. He states that he did not know he was required \nto do so, and he followed what he thought at the time was correct procedure by \ninforming his chain of command (Item 5). \n \nApplicant and the Chinese citizen married in March 2007, and they currently live \ntogether in the UAE. His wife\u2019s mother and 14-year-old daughter are citizens of the PRC \nand live there. His wife has siblings, but Applicant was unable to provide information \nabout them on his security clearance application (Items 4, 5).  \n \nApplicant's mother-in-law is a farmer. His interaction with her and his \nstepdaughter is limited because of the language barrier. Between 2007 and 2008, his \nwife traveled to China to see her family four times: February 2007, Spring 2007, and \nFebruary 2008 and September 2008. She usually stays two to four weeks. Applicant \npays for her trips. Between September and October 2008, Applicant traveled to China \nwith his wife. He informed the company security office of this trip in advance, and \nchecked if there were any requirements to be met. He was told to register his visit with \nthe U.S. Embassy in China. He states that, \u201cWhile on this trip I was unable to locate the \nUS Embassy, and therefore did not register my trip.\u201d During the trip, he met his \nstepdaughter and other relatives. The record does not state whether or not he met his \nspouse\u2019s siblings, and does not provide any information as to their occupations (Item 5). \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse bought her mother and daughter an apartment in China in \nDecember 2007 at a cost of approximately $25,000. Applicant contributed $4,000 to \nhelp with installing required fixtures and furnishings in the apartment. In his \nInterrogatory response, he referred to it as \u201cour apartment.\u201d The house was purchased \nso that Applicant's spouse would have a place to stay on her future trips to China. The \ntitle is solely in the name of Applicant's spouse. Applicant believes that Chinese law \nprohibits him, as a foreigner, from having title to the property. According to Applicant, \nChinese citizens have a \u201cfamily book\u201d that lists members of each family. Applicant \nstates that his wife believes he will have to obtain a \u201cChinese Residency Visa or most \nlikely Chinese Citizenship to get me listed in said \u2018family book\u2019.\u201d It is unclear whether \nApplicant intends to seek inclusion in his wife\u2019s \u201cfamily book.\u201d (Item 5). \n \n \nApplicant's wife has a bank account in China. She keeps funds there for her \nmother to withdraw to support herself and the stepdaughter. As of March 2008, it \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ncontained about $2,000. Applicant's name is not on the account, and he maintains that \nhe cannot obtain information about it or make withdrawals. However, he can and does \nmake deposits through wire transfers from the UAE. During his trip to China in \nSeptember 2008, he asked the bank to enable him to wire funds directly from his U.S. \nbank account to the Chinese account so that he could avoid the extra fees charged for \nthe UAE wire transfers (Item 5). \n \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \n \n \nThe PRC has an authoritarian government dominated by the Chinese \nCommunist Party, which ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed.2 \nOpenness and economic reform have increased, and foreign journalists were allowed \ngreater freedom during the Olympic Games. In addition, the United States and China \nhave cooperated in some areas, including various law enforcement matters, \ntransnational health issues, and threats posed by North Korea\u2019s and Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprograms.  \n \n \nHowever. according to the State Department\u2019s 2008 Human Rights Report, the \nChinese government\u2019s human rights record remained poor and worsened in some \nareas. The government engaged in harassment, detention, and imprisonment of those \nperceived as threatening to the government, as well as unlawful killings by security \nforces, physical abuse and torture of prisoners, and denial of fair public trials. \nAuthorities monitored telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, text messages, \nand internet and email communications. Security services routinely monitored and \nentered residences and offices to gain access to computers, telephones, and fax \nmachines. In 2009, the State Department warned that foreign visitors may be placed \nunder surveillance, hotel rooms and telephones may be monitored, and personal \npossessions may be searched without the traveler\u2019s knowledge or consent. In addition, \nAmericans in China, including those staying with relatives or friends, must register with \nlocal police when they arrive. \n \n \nThe PRC possesses large military forces that are transforming into a smaller, \nmore mobile high-tech military. Civil-military integration has led to increase use of \ncommercial systems in military applications. The PRC has aggressively targeted \nsensitive and protected U.S. economic and militarily critical information subject to export \ncontrol laws. The PRC blends intelligence and non-intelligence assets, relying on covert \nespionage activity by personnel from government ministries, commissions, institutes, \nand military industries independent of the PRC intelligence services, and by targeting \nethnic Chinese who have access to sensitive information. Americans of Chinese \nancestry are considered prime intelligence targets. \n \n \nAmong the record number of countries (108) that engaged in collection efforts \nagainst the United States in 2005, the PRC was among the most aggressive. Ethnic \nChinese with U.S. citizenship and/or legal residency have been convicted of procuring \n \n2 The facts cited derive from the documents submitted by Department Counsel, identified as I through XV. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nand exporting or attempting to export sensitive U.S. technology to the PRC. U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials have rated China\u2019s espionage and \nindustrial theft activities as the leading threat to the security of U.S. technology. The \nU.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\u2019s 2007 Report to Congress \nconcluded that Chinese espionage activities in the United States are so extensive that \nthey comprise the single greatest risk to the security of U.S. technologies. \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors \nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative \nof a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines \nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this \ncase, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration \nof the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline B. \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.5 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the  \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.6 \n \n \n \n3 Directive. 6.3. \n \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n6 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern under Guideline B: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all the disqualifying conditions, and find that the \nfollowing are relevant to the case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n \nThe possession of close family ties with a resident or citizen of a foreign country \nis not, of itself, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, the country in question must \nbe considered and, in particular, whether or not that country targets United States \ncitizens to obtain protected information. The PRC is an active collector of such \ninformation, and so presents a heightened risk of exploitation, manipulation, or \ncoercion.7 Applicant and his wife share living quarters. He has family members who are \ncitizens and residents of the PRC. He has helped his foreign relatives by providing \n$4,000 to purchase and furnish an apartment for them in China. His wife maintains a \n \n7 ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nbank account in China so that her mother can withdraw cash to support herself and \nApplicant's stepdaughter. Applicant transfers funds to this account in China, and is \ntrying to establish a direct link between his U.S. account and her Chinese account to \nmake such transfers easier. Applicant's relationship with his wife, and his demonstrated \nties of obligation to his Chinese relatives, represent a heightened risk of exploitation, \nand support application of AG \u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d).  \n \n \nI have also considered the mitigating conditions under Guideline B, especially the \nfollowing:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \n \n \nIt cannot confidently be predicted that Applicant would not be placed in a position \nthat could force him to choose between U.S. and foreign interests. He is bound by \nstrong ties of affection to his wife, a citizen of a country that routinely targets U.S. \ninterests to obtain sensitive information. Applicant has not presented information that \nwould show his foreign relatives could not be subject to coercion that would force him to \nchoose between their interests and those of the United States. AG \u00b6 8 (a) cannot be \napplied. \n \n \n In evaluating mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b), I considered Applicant's 13 years of \nhonorable military service, and his continued service to the government through \nemployment with a defense contractor. However, Applicant's current situation must be \nevaluated as well. Nothing in the record establishes Applicant's current ties to the \nUnited States. He has lived outside the United States for four years, and there is no \nevidence concerning U.S. family, property, or other indications of strong ties to the \nUnited States. Within weeks of arriving in the UAE, he had established a liaison with a \n\n \n8 \n \n \nforeign national, and sought to continue it, despite having a security clearance at the \ntime. He contributed to the purchase of foreign property, and he seeks to link his U.S. \nbank account with a Chinese account. It is unclear whether he plans to conform to \nChinese law by meeting the requirements for him to be entered in his wife\u2019s \u201cfamily \nbook,\u201d which might entail his obtaining a Chinese visa. His ties to his current wife and \nher family are more current and obvious than his ties to the United States, and it cannot \nbe determined, based on these facts that any conflict of interest would be resolved in \nfavor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his wife\u2019s foreign family appear to be casual, as they \nspeak different languages and cannot communicate with each other. However, his \nwillingness to provide several thousand dollars to help purchase a home for them, and \nhis wish to continue depositing funds to his wife\u2019s account in China that is used to \nsupport them, indicates that he has a sense of obligation to them. Given these facts, \nforeign influence that would sway Applicant in their favor cannot be ruled out. AG \u00b6 8(c) \ndoes not mitigate Applicant\u2019s situation.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to inform his security officer until he had been cohabitating with a \nforeign national for almost one-and-one-half years. He claims that he had no knowledge \nthat he had to inform the company security officer. However, he informed his chain of \ncommand of his relationship, which offers some mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(e). However, \nthis mitigation is insufficient to outweigh the unmitigated facts that raise security \nconcerns. I find against Applicant on Guideline B. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guidelines. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited guideline, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant began a relationship with his wife, a foreign national, he was 31 \nyears old. He was a mature, responsible adult who had served 13 years in the Marine \nCorps and had held a security clearance since 1997. Despite his experience and \nknowledge of the obligations imposed on those who hold security clearances, he began \nand continued an intimate relationship with a foreign national, raising serious questions \nas to his trustworthiness and good judgment. The relationship continues and his \ninvolvement with Applicant's Chinese family has increased over time. Within the past \nyear, he has traveled to China to meet his foreign relatives. He has provided funds to \nhelp them purchase and furnish a home. There is every indication that the relationship \nwith these family members will continue, as demonstrated by Applicant's and his wife\u2019s \nintent to use the home when she visits China in the future. Moreover, Applicant's close \nand ongoing relationship is with foreign nationals of China, a country whose aggressive \ntargeting of sensitive United States information poses a heightened risk of exploitation.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance shows he has not satisfied the doubts raised under the guideline for foreign \ninfluence. Such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.e.  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n_\n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old married woman with one adult child . A prior marriage 1 ended in divorce in 1995 (Exhibit 1 at 17). She was born and raised in the PRC. In 1987, she immigrated to the United States with her then-husband, a professor who had earned a scholarship at a U.S. university (Tr. 41). After the divorce, she enrolled in college, earning an associate\u2019s degree in computing, drafting, and design in 1997 (Tr. 36). She did not receive any education in the PRC past high school. Applicant has been working either in the civil engineering or drafting field since earning her associate\u2019s degree. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002 (Tr. 42). Since 2007, she has been working for her current employer, a defense contractor (Tr. 38). Applicant has no relationship with her first husband. In May 2007, she met her current husband (Tr.44).

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Ying Zhi Zhang, Personal Representative\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant, a naturalized United States (U.S.) citizen originally from the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC), failed to mitigate the foreign influence concerns generated by\nher close relationship with two family members who are PRC citizens and residents.\nClearance is denied. \nOn March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nB, foreign influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 11, 2009, admitting all of the allegations\nand requesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 2009. On June 12,\nAugust 31, 2009\n\nApplicant\u2019s son served as her personal representative.\n1\n2\n2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for July 8, 2009. It was held\nas scheduled. At the hearing, I received two government exhibits and the testimony of\ntwo Applicant witnesses. The transcript was received on July 16, 2009.\nRuling on Evidence\nDepartment Counsel requested I take administrative notice of the facts set forth\nin 15 exhibits that I marked and identified as Exhibits I through XV. I took administrative\nnotice of the facts set forth in all of the administrative notice exhibits except Exhibits VII\nand IX. The following is a summary of the adjudicative facts:\n1. The PRC is a totalitarian state with a large and diverse intelligence\ninfrastructure in the United States (Exhibit III at 1; Exhibit VI at 8). It seeks\nto collect both military and industrial information, and represents a growing\nthreat to national security (see generally, Exhibit IV at 33 - 40);\n2. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials rate the PRC\u2019s\nespionage and industrial theft activities as the leading threat to the\nsecurity of U.S. technology (Exhibit V at 9);\n3. The PRC continues to abuse human rights in violation of internationally\nrecognized norms (see generally, Exhibit III). It routinely monitors its\ncitizen\u2019s communications (Exhibit III at 10). PRC security personnel may\nsometimes place foreign visitors under surveillance (Exhibit II at 2).\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 59-year-old married woman with one adult child . A prior marriage\n1\nended in divorce in 1995 (Exhibit 1 at 17). She was born and raised in the PRC. In\n1987, she immigrated to the United States with her then-husband, a professor who had\nearned a scholarship at a U.S. university (Tr. 41). After the divorce, she enrolled in\ncollege, earning an associate\u2019s degree in computing, drafting, and design in 1997 (Tr.\n36). She did not receive any education in the PRC past high school.\nApplicant has been working either in the civil engineering or drafting field since\nearning her associate\u2019s degree. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002 (Tr. 42).\nSince 2007, she has been working for her current employer, a defense contractor (Tr.\n38).\nApplicant has no relationship with her first husband. In May 2007, she met her\ncurrent husband (Tr.44). They married four months later (Id.). He is also a PRC native.\nHe immigrated to the U.S. in 1998 on a tourist visa (Tr. 45). He remained in the U.S.\nafter the visa expired (Answer at 3). In March 2008, he applied for permanent residence\nstatus (Exhibit 2 at 3). It was granted in September 2008 (Tr. 44; Exhibit A). He is a chef\n\n3\nwho works in a Chinese restaurant (Tr. 45). He and Applicant live in separate towns in\nthe same state. They visit one another a few days per month (Id.). His parents are\ndeceased (Tr. 47). Applicant does not know whether he has any siblings in PRC (Tr.\n46).\nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, and three brothers are PRC citizens and residents.\nHer father is deceased. Her mother is 84 years old. Before retiring in 1958, her mother\nworked as the head of a homeowner\u2019s association (Tr. 27). She was responsible for\nensuring that her community paid various municipal fees timely (Tr. 48). Applicant talks\nto her mother about once every two weeks. Conversations are difficult, because her\nmother\u2019s memory has deteriorated (Tr. 50). \nApplicant last travelled to the PRC to visit her mother in October 2008 (Tr. 48).\nShe stayed for one month. She saw her siblings during the visit (Tr. 50). Previously, she\ntravelled to the PRC to visit her mother in 2005 (Tr. 27). \nApplicant sends her mother up to $500 per year in support (Tr. 57). Applicant has\nno bank accounts or other property interests in the PRC (Tr. 54). She owns her home,\nwhich is valued at $265,000 (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a homemaker. Before retiring, she was a tailor (Tr. 50).\nApplicant talks to her approximately once every two weeks. Applicant keeps abreast of\nher mother\u2019s well-being through her sister (Tr. 51).\nApplicant\u2019s brothers are older than she. They are all retired. Applicant\u2019s oldest\nbrother was a manager of a transportation company (Tr. 24). The next oldest brother\nwas a college administrator, and her youngest brother was a construction worker (Tr.\n24). None of her brothers have any connection with the PRC military. She\ncommunicates with them approximately once per year (Id.).\nNone of Applicant\u2019s relatives are members of the Communist party (Tr. 53). They\nare unaware of the nature of her job (Tr. 26). None of Applicant\u2019s family members have\never visited her in the U.S. (Tr. 53).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\nan evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\n\n4\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nthe individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest\u201d (AG \u00b6\n6). \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, and brothers are citizens of the PRC, a totalitarian\nstate and strategic competitor of the U.S., which aggressively seeks to acquire U.S.\nmilitary and industrial technology by any means necessary. AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies.\nApplicant\u2019s husband is also a PRC resident. However, he lives in the U.S.,\ndividing his time between Applicant\u2019s home and the town where he works. Although he\nlived in the U.S. for several years illegally after his visa expired, he applied for, and was\ngranted, permanent residence status shortly after meeting Applicant. Given the nature\nof his occupation and his U.S. residency, I conclude that neither AG \u00b6 7(a) nor AG \u00b6\n7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if\nthat relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion,\u201d apply. \nApplicant rarely talks with her brothers. AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication\nwith foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d applies.\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s relationship with her mother\nand sister. She is close to both of them. Although her mother is struggling with memory\n\n5\nloss, Applicant keeps abreast of her health through Applicant\u2019s sister. Applicant has\nlived in the U.S. for more than 20 years, and all of her property interests are in the U.S.\nThese factors, though significant, are unable to overcome the heavy burden generated\nby the PRC\u2019s status as a totalitarian state with a history of oppressing its citizens and\naggressively collecting U.S. intelligence.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered the whole person concept factors in my analysis of the mitigating and\ndisqualifying conditions, and it does not warrant a favorable conclusion. Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate the security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In August 2000, he began working as a technician specialist for a federal contractor. He works with hazardous materials.

On March 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 8, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On June 4, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. On \nSeptember 9, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nJune 16, 2009, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing. The case was heard on July 8, 2009, \nas scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, called one witness, and offered Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through E into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on August 13, 2009.     \n                                                       \nProcedural Matters \n \n \n During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the date in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nto conform to the proof. Applicant did not object to the motion and said motion was \ngranted. The date of said allegation is changed from May 24, 2004, to May 12, 2004. \n(Tr.  22-24) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all allegations contained in the SOR. Those \nadmissions are included in the following findings of fact:   \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and married. They have three children, ages 20, 16, \nand 14.  He has one year of college.  In August 2000, he began working as a technician \nspecialist for a federal contractor. He works with hazardous materials. Since August \n2000, his employer has disciplined him three times for his failure to comply with rules \nand regulations for protecting classified or sensitive materials: in May 2004, October \n2004, and March 2007.  \n \n \nOn May 12, 2004, Applicant incorrectly signed the mark out column on the \nsecurity record for the laboratory, as required by his company\u2019s accessing procedures. \nOn May 21, 2004, his manager explained the violation as follows: \n \nThe record contains an improper mark out on May 12th which was due to \nthe operators having accidently recorded a date in the far right time block. \nThe first operator (Employee A) re-signed in the next block down, but the \nsecond operator [Applicant] failed to re-sign the log. We verified that \n[Applicant] was present at that time by checking the electronic door record \nwhich shows that he badged into the lab at 0708 on May 12th. Based on \nthis evidence, we have verified that although the operators failed to \nproperly complete the HML (Hazardous Material Laboratory) Security \nRecord, they were both present and together when they unlocked the \nlaboratory. Thus, two-man control was maintained. We will include proper \nsign-in procedures to our retraining efforts currently underway. (AE A at 6) \n \n  \nApplicant engaged in remedial counseling and received a reprimand for the violation. \nLater, the company changed the security procedures involved in this incident. (Tr. 30-\n34; AE A at 4) There is no evidence that Applicant compromised sensitive material or \ninformation as a result of his conduct. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \nIn early 2004, Applicant\u2019s company moved the main door and key system for the \nlaboratory. On October 26, 2004, Applicant set off the laboratory\u2019s alarm because he \nfailed to deactivate it before entering the room. He explained that he \u201cwas not in the \nhabit of turning the key to go through the door, because it moved from -- it used to be on \nthe left-hand side, now it moved to a different location on the right-hand side.\u201d (Tr. 36) In \nlate October 2004, his manager gave him a Corrective Action Plan that required him to \nread and re-sign the relevant security procedure, read a pertinent excerpt from the \ncompany\u2019s physical security plan, and meet with his manager to discuss security issues. \nHis manager also required him to perform security checks at the end of the day for 30 \ndays and to conduct a staff training session on lab security. He received another \nreprimand for this accessing error. (AE B; Tr. 35-37) There is no evidence that Applicant \ncompromised sensitive material or information as a result of his conduct. \n \nOn March 20, 2007, Applicant\u2019s company changed its standard operating \nprocedure for accessing and controlling surety locks and keys in the vault room, \ncontaining hazardous materials. (AE C) On March 23, 2007, Applicant failed to have a \ncoworker verify with him that both locks on the vault were properly secured before \nleaving the area. As a result of his breach of security procedures, he was suspended \nfrom work for three days. As part of a Corrective Action Plan, he went through a one-\nday training program on co-person verification of securing vaults. He was also required \nto give a presentation to the staff on the pertinent procedures and to resecure the vault \nfor 30 days. (AE C; Tr. 42-44)  Subsequently, the company made several additional \nchanges pertinent to securing controlled access areas.1 (Tr. 45-46) Under those new \nprocedures, he would not have been disciplined. (Tr. 48) There is no evidence that \nApplicant compromised sensitive material or information as a result of his conduct. \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor\u2019s manager testified. He oversees the facility that contains \nthe hazardous materials where Applicant works. He has held a secret security \nclearance for 18 years.  He confirmed that subsequent to the May 2004 incident, the \ncompany changed its procedures to address Applicant\u2019s violation.  Immediately prior to \nthe October 2004 and March 2007 incidents, the company had changed procedures. \n(Tr. 60-61) Despite these infractions, he does not have concerns that Applicant poses a \nsecurity risk. (Tr. 62) He noted that Applicant\u2019s 2009 evaluation rated Applicant as an \n\u201cabove average\u201d employee. (Tr. 63) Based on Applicant\u2019s overall performance, he \nappointed Applicant as a trainer for other employees. (Tr. 64)  \n \nSince starting work with his employer, Applicant has received 13 performance \nawards. (AE E) His performance appraisals for 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008, \nconsistently rate him as exceeding expectations in several categories. (AE D)  \n      \n \nApplicant testified candidly and credibly. He takes full responsibility for breaching \nsecurity procedures. Since the last incident in 2007, he has tried to \u201cslow down and pay \n                                            \n1The company disciplined three other employees for the March 23, 2007 incident. (GE 3)  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nbetter attention to detail.\u201d (Tr. 67) He is aware that if he is involved in another incident in \nthe future, he will lose his job.  (Tr. 56) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an  \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \n \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n \n \n5\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for handling protected information \nis set out in AG & 33:       \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nAG \u00b6 34 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying based on the facts of this case: \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information; and \n(h) negligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \nApplicant admitted that on three occasions he failed to comply with security \nprocedures, two of which occurred after he had been reprimanded and counseled for \nprevious infractions. The foregoing disqualifications have been raised. \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation. AG \u00b6 35 \nprovides two conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n (b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; and, \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \n \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s facility manager, Applicant has responded very \nfavorably to all security counseling and remedial training. In fact, Applicant is now \ntraining other employees in security procedures. These facts coupled with \nApplicant\u2019s cautious attitude in executing his security responsibilities trigger the \napplication of AG \u00b6 35(b).  Two of Applicant\u2019s security breaches occurred within \ndays of a change in the company\u2019s security procedures. After Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent security breach, which also involved three other employees, the company \nchanged the pertinent security procedures. These factors are sufficient evidence \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nto warrant the partial application of AG \u00b6 35(c), as it appears that the company \nmay have had a role in failing to properly train its employees.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the fact that sensitive \nmaterials or information were never compromised.  Applicant is a 39-year-old man who \nbreached security procedures three times within a three-year period of time. Despite \nthat history, his employer has complete confidence in his future ability to comply with all \nsecurity procedures and strongly recommends him for a security clearance. In fact, the \ncompany has asked him to train other employees in its security policies and procedures. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s awareness that a future breach would result in the termination of his \njob and his diligent efforts to avoid another incident, it is most unlikely that similar \nincidents will recur. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline K.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:   \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated Personal Conduct concerns, but he has not mitigated Drug \nInvolvement security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 19, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nH (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG).  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 5, 2010, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 12, 2010. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on July 28, 2010, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nAugust 19, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nSeptember 7, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, and submitted \nExhibits (AE) A through J, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 27, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the \nUnited States military from 2003 until he was honorably discharged in 2007. He seeks \nto retain his security clearance. He has an associate\u2019s degree from a community \ncollege. He attends a university in pursuit of a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is divorced and \nhas no children.1 \n \nApplicant had a Top Secret (TS) security clearance and was eligible for access to \nSensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) while he was in the military. There is no \nevidence that he has ever had a security violation. Applicant started working for his \ncurrent employer while he was on terminal leave before his discharge from the military. \nHe has held a security clearance during his entire tenure at his current employment. \nThe level of his security clearance as a civilian employee is not completely clear, but it \nwas at least a Secret clearance.2 \n \n \nApplicant smoked marijuana on about seven occasions from May 2007, which \nwas after he was discharged from the military, until April 2008. He held a security \nclearance during each occasion that he smoked marijuana. He smoked marijuana on \ntwo occasions with a classmate from the community college he was attending. The \nclassmate offered him the marijuana. He smoked marijuana on occasions at concerts \nwhen the marijuana was passed around by concert attendees. He also smoked \nmarijuana on one occasion when it was offered to him by his brother. Applicant admitted \nhe exhibited poor judgment by smoking marijuana. He stated that he was exercising his \nnewfound freedom from the military.3  \n \n \nApplicant decided to quit smoking marijuana. He has not used illegal drugs since \nApril 2008. He attended several Narcotics Anonymous (NA) sessions. In April 2008, he \nnotified his security officer about his drug use so that the information could be forwarded \nto the Department of Defense. He fully discussed his marijuana use in an interview with \nan investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in August 2008.4 \n \nApplicant no longer associates with the community college classmate. He rarely \nattends concerts, and if he does attend one, he avoids anyone who appears to be using \ndrugs. His brother lives in another state, and Applicant does not see him often. \nApplicant told his brother that he no longer uses illegal drugs, and that his brother \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 26, 29, 35; GE 1, 3; AE F. \n \n2 Tr. at 26-28; GE 1, 3; AE H-J. \n \n3 Tr. at 29-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE B. \n \n4 Tr. at 14, 26, 31; GE 5; AE B. \n\n \n3 \n \nshould also abstain and not use any drugs around him. Applicant received a substance \nabuse evaluation and was given a drug test in June 2010. The results of the evaluation \n\u201cindicated a low probability of Substance Dependence Disorder,\u201d and the drug test was \nnegative. He was not recommended for further treatment. Applicant credibly testified \nthat he did not intend to use illegal drugs again. He deeply regretted the poor decisions \nhe made when he smoked marijuana. He submitted a signed statement of intent not to \nuse illegal drugs, with automatic revocation of his clearance for any violation.5 \n \nApplicant received a medal while in the military recognizing his meritorious \nservice. Two witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf and praised his job performance, \ntechnical ability, honesty, responsibility, reliability, professionalism, and trustworthiness. \nHis most recent performance evaluation reflects superior job performance and shows \nthat Applicant is a valued and trusted employee.6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 16, 32-36; AE A, B. \n \n6 Tr. at 37-43; AE D, E, G. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern for Drug Involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;7  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant smoked marijuana while holding a security clearance. He had to \npossess marijuana in order to smoke it. The evidence is sufficient to raise all the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. a and 1.b allege the same illegal drug use, except SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges \nthat the marijuana use occurred after Applicant \u201chad been granted SCI eligibility\u201d in \n2006 and \u201cgiven access to Top Secret\u201d in February 2008. When two allegations under \nthe same guideline allege the same conduct, at least one must be concluded for the \napplicant. SOR \u00b6 1.a is concluded for Applicant. \n                                                          \n7 Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from \napproved medical direction.  \n\n \n5 \n \nTwo Drug Involvement mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance on seven occasions \nbetween May 2007 and April 2008. He has not used illegal drugs since April 2008. He \nno longer associates with any drug-using associates except his brother, who he rarely \nsees. He attended several Narcotics Anonymous sessions, and he notified his security \nofficer about his drug use. He credibly testified that he will not use illegal drugs in the \nfuture. I find that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. Applicant signed a statement of \nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, with automatic revocation of clearance for \nany violation. AG \u00b6 26(b) is applicable.  \n \n \nThere is no bright-line rule as to whether conduct is recent. Applicant has not \nused illegal drugs since April 2008. However, he served in the military for four years and \nknew that illegal drug use was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nIn sum, I conclude that security concerns remain despite the presence of some \nmitigation.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance. That conduct \ncreated a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \napplicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant stopped using marijuana in April 2008 and informed his security officer \nabout his marijuana use. He has taken positive steps to reduce his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 17(e) is applicable. Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns have been mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service as well as his superior job \nperformance and the reputation he has earned at his current job. I found him to be a \ncredible witness. However, even if Applicant never uses illegal drugs again, his illegal \ndrug use while holding a security clearance, knowing it was illegal and counter to DoD \npolicy, raises doubts about his current judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Two \nplus years of abstinence is not yet long enough to mitigate his incidents of extremely \npoor judgment, disregard for the law, and violation of the trust instilled in him while \nholding a security clearance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Personal Conduct concerns, but he has not mitigated Drug \nInvolvement security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on May 6, 2009, Applicant admitted one of the two\nallegations set forth in the SOR under Guideline C and both allegations raised under\nGuideline B.

Applicant received the FORM on\nSeptember 10, 2009, but failed to respond to its contents. On November 3, 2009, the\nDirector, DOHA, forwarded the case for assignment to an administrative judge. It was\nassigned to another administrative judge on November 3, 2009, then reassigned to me\nJanuary 22, 2010\n\n FORM at 2-9; see supporting documents I - XVI.\n      1\n FORM at 4.\n      2\n FORM at 3; Message to the Congress of the United States, dated Mar. 11, 2008.\n      3\n FORM at 5.\n      4\n FORM at 6.\n      5\n FORM 6-7.\n      6\n2\non December 7, 2009, because of case load considerations. Based on a review of the\ncase file and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden regarding the security\nconcerns raised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42-year-old senior software engineer who has worked for the same\ngovernment contractor since May 2008. He has over a decade of experience in his field\nand has earned a master\u2019s degree in engineering. Married, he is the father of two\nchildren. This case involves allegations that Applicant exercises dual citizenship and\npossesses a foreign passport. Additionally, foreign influence concerns are alleged\nconcerning Applicant\u2019s mother, a sister, and a brother, all of whom are citizens and\nresidents of Iran. In choosing an administrative determination without a hearing,\nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. Because his submissions are brief, the\nfacts of record are limited. \nAdministrative notice is taken with regard to Iran.  Specifically, it is noted that\n1\nIran is a theocratic republic. The United States (U.S.) has not had diplomatic or\nconsular relations with Iran since November 1979. Iran was designated as a state\nsponsor of terrorism in January 1984 and remains the most active state sponsor of\nterrorism.  In March 2008, it was officially noted that \u201cthe actions and policies of the\n2\ngovernment of Iran are contrary to the interests of the United States in the region and\npose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign\npolicy, and economy of the United States.\u201d  Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons\n3\nand other weapons of mass destruction concern the United States.  Over the years, it\n4\nhas sought to illegally obtain United States military equipment and other sensitive\ntechnology.  It has a poor and worsening record with regard to human rights, including\n5\nthe monitoring of the social activities of its citizens, politically motivated abductions,\narbitrary arrests, a lack of judicial independence, and torture. 6\nIn 1967, Applicant was born in Iran. In 1986, he immigrated to Canada, a\nconstitutional monarchy with a parliamentary government and strong democratic\ntraditions. He continued with his education and became a Canadian citizen in 1994. He\ncompleted his education at the master\u2019s level in 1996. The following year, he accepted\na new position located in the United States (U.S.) and moved to this country. In 1998,\nhe married a U.S. citizen and, in 2005, he became a U.S. citizen. \n\n The pension fund is akin to Social Security. Applicant has no idea of his pension\u2019s current value. He\n      7\nrecognizes that it may generate minimal retirement income, but would like to \u201cmaintain its viability as an\naddition to his retirement when that day comes.\u201d Item 6 at 6.\n Item 6 at 4.\n      8\n Id. at 5-6; FORM at 13.\n      9\n3\nToday, Applicant is a dual citizen of both the U.S. and Canada. He has not\nreturned to Iran since his emigration from that country. He maintains his Canadian\ncitizenship in order to remain eligible for benefits from the Canadian Pension System,\ninto which he contributed for over a decade while living and working there.  He may\n7\nreturn to Canada upon retirement.  Applicant has traveled extensively through Europe,\n8\nwith the vast majority of his travel taking place before 2005. Shortly before becoming a\nU.S. citizen in 2005, he renewed his Canadian passport. It was valid through January\n10, 2010. Through at least May 2009, when he responded to the SOR, Applicant had\nnot used his Canadian passport since becoming a U.S. citizen. In his SOR response,\nhe noted his willingness to renounce his dual-citizenship and surrender his Canadian\npassport.\nApplicant has two older brothers. One is a citizen and resident of Canada, while\nthe eldest brother remains a citizen and resident of Iran. Applicant maintains regular\ncontact with his Canadian brother through monthly telephone conversations and\nconducts weekend visits every couple of years. His contact with his eldest sibling, a\nphysician who is now over 60 years of age, is minimal. They speak by telephone about\nonce a year. The two last visited in person during his brother\u2019s visit to the U.S. in 2004,\nfollowing a 2003 visit convened in Europe.  There is no information as to whether this\n9\nbrother receives or may receive any form of state pension, subsidy, or benefit, or has\never worked for a foreign government.\nApplicant also has a sister who is a resident and citizen of Iran. She is his eldest\nsibling and nearly 20 years older than Applicant. They last saw each other at a family\nreunion in Canada in 2006. Prior to this visit, they visited during a trip to Europe in\n2002. She is retired, but there are no facts regarding her former profession except a\nnote that, like the rest of her family, she has no affiliation with any government or\nforeign country. There is no information as to whether she receives a state pension,\nsubsidy, or other government benefit. Applicant\u2019s sister resides with their mother, who is\nin her late 70s. Consequently, Applicant and his sister converse by telephone whenever\nhe calls his mother in Iran, which is about three or four times a year.\nIn 2002, Applicant saw his mother for the first time in 17 years. They last saw\neach other during the 2006 family reunion. In the interim, they maintained occasional\ncontact by telephone. Applicant\u2019s mother is also retired, but there is no information\nregarding her former profession or whether she receives any form of state subsidy,\nbenefit, or retirement. \n\n Response to the SOR, dated May 6, 2009.\n      10\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      11\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      12\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      13\n4\nNone of Applicant\u2019s relatives have been approached by any foreign agents or\ninterests regarding Applicant, his work, or his current application for a security\nclearance. There has been no indication of any hostile interest in either Applicant or his\nfamily members. Applicant stated that his family members \u201chave no government ties\nand [he sees] no reason for their existence to influence [his] life here in the United\nStates where [he owns] a home and [has] established [him]self with a wife of 10 years\nand two young children.\u201d10\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they\nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d An administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe United States Government (Government) must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for\npresenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts\nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is\n11\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion\n12\nis on the applicant.  \n13\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\n\n See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive\n      14\ninformation), and EO 10865 \u00a7 7.\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      15\n Id.\n      16\n5\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security\n14\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any\n15\nreasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting such information.  The decision to\n16\ndeny an individual a security clearance does not necessarily reflect badly on an\napplicant\u2019s character. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a\nclearance.\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) are the\nmost pertinent AGs to the case. Applicable conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline C \u2013 Foreign Preference\nUnder Guideline C, \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates.\u201d Here, Applicant maintained a Canadian passport which only recently expired\nand which, presumably, he still possesses. He continues to maintain dual citizenship\nwith Canada to retain his investment in its state pension fund and to maintain the option\nof returning to Canada upon retirement. Such facts raise security concerns under\nforeign preference disqualifying condition (FP DC) AG \u00b6 10(a) (\u201cexercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1)\npossession of a current foreign passport; . . . (3) accepting educational, medical,\nretirement, or social welfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country; . . . (5) using\na foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country. . . .\u201d).\nArguably, FP DC AG \u00b6 10(d) (\u201cany statement or action that shows allegiance to a\n\n6\ncountry other than the United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce\nUnited States citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship\u201d) also applies with\nregard to Applicant\u2019s exercise of dual citizenship. Consequently, the burden shifts to\nApplicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant possesses a Canadian passport. He has not used it since becoming a\nU.S. citizen and he has expressed his willingness to surrender it. The passport expired\non January 10, 2010. Therefore, it is no longer current, as contemplated under AG \u00b6\n10(a) (1). Foreign preference mitigating condition (FP MC) AG \u00b6 11(e) (\u201cthe passport\nhas been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated\u201d) also applies to the extent the passport became invalid upon expiration and\nthere is no evidence that it has been renewed.\nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s statement that he might return to Canada upon\nretirement, security concerns could be raised by the inference that Applicant\u2019s\nallegiance to Canada is superior to his allegiance to the United States. Such an\ninference would give rise to AG \u00b6 10(d), noted above. Applicant, however, expressed\nhis willingness to renounce his dual citizenship, raising FP MC AG \u00b6 11(b) (\u201cthe\nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship\u201d).  \nRemaining at issue is Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a Canadian pension, regarding\nwhich he has not expressed a willingness to renounce. The guideline does not\ndistinguish between the intention to accept and the actual acceptance of foreign\npension benefits. In both circumstances, the individual has an ongoing financial tie to a\nforeign country. Moreover, while Applicant confirmed that the amount at issue is not\nsignificant, the guideline does not discount potentially nominal sums and the facts fail to\nreveal sufficient information regarding his overall financial situation. While this future\ninterest may be a nominal consideration in his overall retirement planning, it remains\nsufficiently valid to raise security concerns which Applicant failed to mitigate. Security\nconcerns remain unmitigated.\nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence\nGuideline B states that \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in\na way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest.\u201d The guideline further states that adjudication under this section should\nconsider the identity of the country at issue and \u201csuch considerations as whether the\nforeign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information\nand/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d In this case, the country at issue with\nregard to Guideline B and Applicant\u2019s relatives abroad is Iran. The record is replete with\ninformation regarding Iran, with which the U.S. has been on strained terms for over 30\nyears. Iran was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in January 1984 and\nremains an active sponsor of terrorism. It has sought to illegally obtain U.S. military\nequipment and sensitive technology. Consequently, the situation presented demands\nheightened scrutiny.\n\n ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).\n      17\n ISCR Case No. 02-04786 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003).\n      18\n7\nThe facts presented emphasize the minimal contact Applicant has with those\nfamily members residing in Iran who are at issue in the SOR, specifically his mother,\nsister, and his eldest brother. While contact may be infrequent, there is a rebuttable\npresumption that an applicant\u2019s contacts with immediate family members are not\ncasual  and that the necessary Guideline B inquiry concerns both ties of affection and\n17\nties of obligation.  \n18\nApplicant speaks on the telephone with his mother and sister about every three\nor four months. While they did not visit for nearly 17 years, Applicant resumed visits\nwith his mother in 2002. He saw both his mother and sister at a family reunion in\nCanada in 2006. While he only speaks with his elder brother about once a year, they\nvisited together in 2003 and 2004. Such facts raise Foreign Influence Disqualifying\nCondition (FI DC) AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and\nthe individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation.\u201d).\nApplicant failed to provide any information regarding Iran in response to the\nFORM. Moreover, while Applicant may consider his relationships with his Iranian\nrelatives casual, his request for a determination on the written record preempts further\ninquiry into his family dynamics and precludes substantiation of his assessment.\nFurther, he failed to elaborate on his family members\u2019 lives in Iran, for example,\nwhether they received or are eligible to receive state benefits. He also offered scant\nfacts regarding his present life in the U.S., noting little more than the facts that he\nimmigrated to the U.S. in 1997, that he is employed in the U.S., that his wife and\nchildren are U.S. citizens, and that he owns his own home. \nConsequently, Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) AG \u00b6 8(a) (\u201cthe\nnature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the position or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d), FI MC AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because of the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S, that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d), and FI MC AG \u00b6 8(c) (\u201ccontact or communication\nwith foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d) do not apply. None of the remaining\n\n8\nmitigating conditions apply. Because Applicant failed to address the concerns related to\nthe security issues raised, security concerns remain unmitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Although the facts of record are few, multiple factors speak in his favor. He is a\nmature man who left his family and Iran as a young man to start a new life abroad. He\nearned a master\u2019s degree in Canada and has traveled extensively. Married, he is\nraising two U.S.-born children and owns a home in the U.S. \nMultiple facts, however, also speak against Applicant. In choosing an\nadministrative determination, Applicant relied on a written record which was less than\ncomprehensive. There are insufficient facts regarding Applicant\u2019s current investments\nand holdings to gauge his need for a Canadian pension. While he expressed a\nwillingness to renounce his Canadian citizenship, there is no evidence he is equally\nwilling to renounce his right to state pension payments in the future. Aside from his\ncurrent financial situation, there are few facts concerning Applicant\u2019s roots in either his\npresent community or in the U.S. \nSimilarly, insufficient facts are presented with regard to his relatives in Iran, the\ndepth of their familial relationships, or his sense of loyalty to them. Other questions\nremain unaddressed, obviating the mitigation of security concerns regarding foreign\ninfluence. Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such information and\n\n9\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. There\nare no facts bringing Applicant\u2019s loyalty or commitment to the U.S. into question. His\nreliance on a less than comprehensive written record leaves significant questions\nunresolved under both applicable guidelines, either of which are sufficient to find\nsecurity concerns are left unmitigated. Consequently, he failed to meet his burden of\npersuasion. Therefore, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with national security to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

After graduating from high school in 1983, Applicant joined the U.S. Marine Corps where he served for the next 13 years. He was honorably discharged. While in the Marines, he earned several medals and citations including the Meritorious Unit Citation and the Good Conduct Medal. (Tr. 17) Since leaving the Marines in 1997, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor as a systems engineer. (Tr. 17) Specifically, he assists with flight control services for an aircraft system.

Clearance is\ngranted.\nStatement of the Case\nOn June 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG).\nApplicant answered the SOR on August 17, 2009, denying all of the allegations\nexcept SOR subparagraph 1.a.

While in the Marines, he earned\nseveral medals and citations including the Meritorious Unit Citation and the Good\nConduct Medal. (Tr. 17)\nSince leaving the Marines in 1997, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor\nas a systems engineer. (Tr. 17) Specifically, he assists with flight control services for an\naircraft system.\nApplicant is highly respected on the job and in the community. According to a\ncoworker, he is \u201cdedicated to the task, insightful, industrious, and committed to doing\nthe job right.\u201d (AE Q) A longtime friend with whom Applicant served in the Marines\ncharacterizes him as \u201cone of the most hard working, dedicated, and honest people that\n[he] know[s].\u201d (AE P)\nAt or about the time Applicant was transitioning from the Marine Corps, his wife\nwas struggling with multiple physical and emotional problems stemming from five failed\npregnancies. (GE 1 at 2) She subsequently was diagnosed with clinical depression.\nDuring this period, she became increasingly unable to maintain a steady job. Because\nApplicant was dependent on both incomes to maintain the family finances, their debts\ngrew delinquent. (Id.)\nBy 2002, Applicant had accrued a $5,000 federal income tax delinquency for tax\nyears 1993, and 1995 through 1997, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.m. In 2002,\nApplicant\u2019s car was repossessed, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.l. (Tr. 45)\nIn 2003, Applicant relocated to another state. The cost of living in the state where\nthey relocated was much higher than that of the state from where they had moved. (Tr.\n45)  Also, Applicant\u2019s wife was unable to obtain full-time, steady employment after they\n1\nmoved.\n\n3\nIn May 2003, the IRS obtained a lien against Applicant\u2019s property and garnished\nhis wages. (AE 2 at 2) By early 2006, Applicant had satisfied the IRS delinquency\nthrough a combination of payments through the garnishment and the application of tax\nrefunds to the delinquency from subsequent tax years. (AE Z at 2, 5 - 6, 16, and 19) \nApproximately $14,000 of debt, however, remained delinquent. In 2008,\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s grandmother died. After probate, they inherited $71,330, which they\nreceived in July 2009. (AE A) The following month, Applicant began satisfying his\ndelinquencies, as follows:\nDebt\nAmount\nDescription and date satisfied\nRecord\nb.\n$140.00\ncable tv - 8/17/09 \nAE D at 1.\nc.\n$192.90\nphone - 8/17/09\nAE D at 2.\nd.\n$386.00\nwater - exact date unknown. 2/12/10 letter\nfrom creditor reflects $0 balance.\nAE U.\ne.\n$379.00\nsatellite tv - 8/17/09\nAE D at 1.\nf.\n$289.00\nphone - 8/14/09 \nAE E.\ng.\n$267.00\ngas - 12/17/09\nAE F.\nh.\n$273.00\nveterinarian - exact date unknown.

Applicant contacted the creditor listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.s. It could not locate any record confirming that he owed this debt. (Tr.\n\nApplicant\u2019s wife spent the remainder of her inheritance on attorney fees related to a lawsuit against her\n2\nstepmother involving the right to visit her father, an invalid. (Tr. 35) \n4\n28) I find that this debt is not his responsibility. Applicant successfully disputed the debt\nlisted in SOR subparagraph 1.u, and it was removed from his credit report. (AE N)\nThe delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a, in the amount of $8,018, is the\ndeficiency remaining from a repossessed car in 2005. (Tr. 46) Approximately 18 months\nago, the creditor offered to close the account in exchange for a $2,500 lump-sum\npayment. (Tr. 37) Applicant could not then afford it. After receiving the inheritance,\nApplicant contacted the creditor to attempt to settle the account consistent with the\noriginal offer. The creditor, however, had withdrawn the offer. Currently, they are\nnegotiating a settlement. Applicant prefers to pay the total over a 120-month period,\nwhereas, the creditor wants a lump-sum payment. \nApplicant and his wife have spent all of the money received through the\ninheritance.  (Tr. 35) Applicant has $5,100 in savings and $7,000 in a 401k account. (Tr.\n2\n34). If he cannot negotiate an agreement with the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph\n1.a, he will satisfy it entirely using money from his savings or by borrowing money from\nhis 401k account. (Tr. 36) \nApplicant maintains a budget. (Tr. 47) He earns $83,000 annually. (Tr. 34)\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s income has remained sporadic over the years, they are no\nlonger dependent on her income to make ends meet. (Tr. 48)\nApplicant has not attended financial counseling. (Tr. 49) However, both he and\nhis wife have read books on money management. Also, both \u201cunderstand where the\nmoney\u2019s going and what [they] have to spend.\u201d (Tr. 49)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by extravagant spending.\nInstead, they were caused by the difficulties his wife had in maintaining steady\nemployment. Because they were dependent on both incomes to make ends meet, they\nwere unable to maintain financial solvency when she was not working.\n\n6\nSince Applicant\u2019s wife received her inheritance, they have either satisfied or\nsuccessfully disputed all of their delinquent debts except for one, an automobile\ndeficiency, which they are attempting to settle in good faith. \nBefore Applicant\u2019s wife received the inheritance, he had done little to address his\nfinancial delinquencies. Although his wife\u2019s struggles maintaining steady employment\nexacerbated his financial difficulties, they do not entirely outweigh the negative security\ninference created by having two cars repossessed within five years.\nNevertheless, the receipt of the inheritance has enabled Applicant to pay nearly\nall of his delinquencies and reorganize the family finances such that he can manage\nthem with his income solely. Also, the savings he has accrued over the last two years\nminimize the possibility of recurrence, and enhance the credibility of his assertion that\nhe will satisfy the last outstanding debt. I conclude that all of the mitigating conditions,\nas listed above, apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI evaluated the whole-person factors when I addressed the applicability of the\nmitigating conditions. I conclude Applicant has rehabilitated his financial situation. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.u:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 24, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline G, \nAlcohol Consumption. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 19, 2010, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2010. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 5, 2010, and the hearing was convened as \nMarch 25, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \nscheduled on October 27, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I.  Applicant testified, called one witness, and offered \nexhibits (AE) A through X, which were admitted into evidence without objection.1 \nApplicant\u2019s exhibit list was marked as HE II. Additionally, Applicant submitted two post-\nhearing exhibits that were admitted into evidence as AE Y and Z. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on November 5, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations except for a \ndiscrepancy related to SOR \u00b6 1.e concerning the location of his treatment. I have \nadopted these admissions in my findings of fact, and after a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. He is divorced and has two children. He contributes to \nboth daughters\u2019 college costs. He has worked as a software specialist for a defense \ncontractor for 10 years. He has a high school diploma and some college credits. He has \nheld a security clearance since 1996.2   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct raised in the SOR includes: (1) consuming alcohol, to the \npoint of intoxication, from about 1983 (when he was 16 years old) to 2009 (admitted); \n(2) an arrest in January 2008, for a second offense driving while intoxicated (DWI) \ncharge (admitted); (3) receiving treatment for alcohol abuse from June 2008 through \nFebruary 2009 from an alcohol treatment program (admitted); (4) an arrest for felony hit-\nand-run and resulting guilty plea to reckless driving charge in November 2007 \n(admitted); (5) receiving treatment for alcohol issues from April 2004 through September \n2004 from an alcohol treatment program (admitted); and (6) arrest and resulting guilty \nplea to DWI in January 2004 (admitted). \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant was around 16 years old, he began consuming alcohol. Most of \nthe time he drank beer, but sometimes he also drank liquor. He drank about three beers \nat weekend parties and other social events. This pattern of drinking continued up \nthrough the time his children were born. He stopped drinking completely when they \nwere infants. He resumed drinking alcohol again in the mid-1990\u2019s. During this time, \nApplicant\u2019s drinking pattern included going to bars and nightclubs every other day, \neither alone or with friends, and consuming alcohol. He would drink alcohol at the rate \nof 1.5 drinks per hour. During football season, he would spend approximately 10 hours \nat the bar on weekends. He drank as much as 12 beers on at least one occasion. \nDuring the weekday, he would spend about three to four hours at the bar after work. He \nwould drink four to six drinks, mostly beer and sometimes a shot of liquor, on these \n                                                          \n1 AE A through L were also attached to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR. \n \n2 Tr. at 20-23, 45; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \noccasions. He would drive himself home after these drinking sessions. He was most \nlikely over the legal limit when he drove home after these sessions.3  \n \n \nSometime in January 2004, Applicant drove from work and stopped at a bar near \nhis home. He spent three to four hours there and consumed about two mixed drinks and \nfive or six beers. He left the bar around 9:30 or 10:00 pm and started home. \nApproximately 100 yards from the bar, he stopped at a red light. He fell asleep while \nstopped at the light, his foot slipped off the brake, and he rolled into and hit the car in \nfront of him. The police were called. He was suspected of drunk driving and given field \nsobriety and breathalyzer tests. He failed the tests and was arrested for DWI. He pled \nguilty to DWI and was sentenced. As part of his sentence, he was required to complete \nthe Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP). His driver\u2019s license was also suspended for \none year.4 \n \n \nIn 2004, as part of his ASAP requirement, Applicant saw an alcohol-abuse \ncounselor. He attended 17 or 18 group counseling sessions. He does not recall \nreceiving a diagnosis and he did not see the final evaluation by the counselor. The \ncounselor\u2019s evaluation did not state a diagnosis for Applicant, but stated in his final \nreport, he believed Applicant showed \u201cgood to fair\u201d insight into his alcohol involvement.5   \n \n \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant stopped at the same bar that he was at prior to his \n2004 DWI charge and had three beers and a shot of liquor over the course of two to \nthree hours. He then left the bar and drove home. On his way home, he ran into some \nroad construction. He then had a fender bender with another vehicle. He spoke to the \nother driver and thought they had worked out a settlement arrangement and then he left \nthe scene. He did not give the other driver his insurance information. Several days later, \nhe was arrested for felony hit-and-run. The charge was reduced and he pled guilty to \nreckless driving. Applicant admitted he left the scene before the police arrived because \nhe had been drinking.6  \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant went to his favorite bar after work, stayed for about \nthree hours and consumed four beers, one shot of liquor, and one mixed drink while he \nwas there. He then drove home. He was stopped by a police officer because he crossed \na center line. His blood alcohol content registered a .16 on the breathalyzer machine. \nHe was arrested for DWI (second within five years). He pled guilty and was sentenced. \nHis sentence included three years of probation, through April 2011. His driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for three years, although he was able to get a restricted license with an \n                                                          \n3 GE 4. \n \n4 GE 4; Tr. at 48-49. \n \n5 GE 9; Tr. at 50, AE G. \n \n6 GE 4; 51-52, 72-73. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninterlock device for his vehicles. Once again, he was ordered by the court to attend \nASAP classes.7  \n \n \nStarting in June 2008, as part of his ASAP requirement, Applicant saw a licensed \nclinical social worker (LCSW) about his alcohol problem. He was diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser. He attended 16 individual counseling sessions ending in October 2008. \nHis prognosis was noted as \u201cguarded\u201d. Even though he completed his ASAP \nrequirement, he was still on probation. In December 2008, Applicant was called in by his \nprobation officer to give a breath sample. One of the conditions of his probation was \ntotal abstinence from alcohol. He tested positive for alcohol in his system. He admitted \nto his probation officer to drinking three beers the night before in violation of his \nprobation. He was sent back to the LCSW he had previously seen. He admitted to his \ncounselor that he drank on several more occasions during his probation. He also \nattended five additional counseling sessions. In a session held on December 16, 2008, \nthe LCSW wrote this note about Applicant: \u201cI am not so sure how committed he is to \nmaking things be different than they are\u201d. The last treatment update document in the \nrecord from the LCSW is dated December 29, 2009, and his prognosis was still \n\u201cguarded\u201d. In his last treatment session on January 12, 2009, the LCSW wrote this note \nabout Applicant: \u201cI talked to him directly about drinking\u2014he says that he might continue \nto drink when he is off probation\u201d. The LCSW also stated: \u201cI have to admit, that I do not \nhave any idea whether he is continuing to drink or not\u201d.8  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he last drank alcohol on December 3, 2008, the night \nbefore he was called into his probation officer\u2019s office to give a breath sample. However, \nin his affidavit dated February 3, 2009, Applicant stated that from November 2008 \nthrough the holiday season of 2008, he consumed about three beers per week at bars \nand holiday parties. He further stated his consumption since January 9, 2009, was \nabout one beer every two weeks. Finally, he stated his last drink was one beer on \nFebruary 1, 2009. Applicant knew all of these drinking episodes were violations of his \nprobation.9  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he is an alcoholic and is currently attending Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings about two times per week. He is not working the AA steps \nand has never had an AA sponsor. He signed a statement of intent that he will not \nabuse alcohol or drink and drive in the future. His probation officer noted that he \ncompleted his substance abuse education and treatment. Applicant is supported by \ncharacter testimony and several character letters attesting to his honesty, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. Applicant is viewed as a valued employee and loyal \n                                                          \n7 GE 4; Tr. at 52-55. \n \n8 GE 10; See Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV 305.00. \n \n9 Tr. at 47, 83-85, 91-93; GE 4. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfriend.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 32-39, 60, 89-97; AE B, D, J-Z. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Several are applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from, such as driving while under the \ninfluence. . .regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependant; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \nApplicant\u2019s DWI arrests in 2004 and 2008 and his 2007 reckless driving arrest \nwere all alcohol related incidents away from work. His drinking habits of attending the \nsame bar, drinking heavily, and repeatedly driving home while intoxicated show a \npattern of habitual or binge consumption. In October 2008, Applicant was diagnosed by \na licensed clinical social worker from the state\u2019s ASAP program as an alcohol abuser. In \nDecember 2008 through February 2009, he continued to drink alcohol after completion \nof his alcohol treatment program and while he remained on probation. All the \ndisqualifying conditions listed above apply.  \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for Alcohol Consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23 and especially considered the following: \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest was in 2008, however, his drinking \ncontinued through February 2009 in violation of his terms of probation. Although over \ntwo years have past since his last arrest, Applicant\u2019s history of drinking while driving, \nfailed alcohol counselling, and questionable credibility concerning when he stopped \ndrinking cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n23(a) does not apply. Applicant acknowledges his alcoholism and claims to have \nestablished a pattern of abstinence since December 3, 2008. That claim is contradicted \nby his earlier admissions of drinking beyond that time. I am not convinced Applicant has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence that is sufficient under these facts. AG \u00b6 23(b) does \nnot apply. There is no evidence that Applicant is currently undergoing counselling or \ntreatment, but there is evidence that he has a history of previous treatment and relapse. \nAG \u00b6 23(c) does not apply. Applicant completed outpatient alcohol counselling in 2004, \nrelapsed, then re-entered counselling in 2008 where he was placed back in the program \nafter initially completing it when he tested positive for alcohol use by his probation \nofficer. His prognosis from his LCSW was \u201cguarded\u201d. Although he is currently attending \nAA and he successfully completed his alcohol treatment in August 2010, he was not \ngiven a favorable prognosis. AG \u00b6 23(d) partially applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s outstanding service to his employer. I also \nconsidered the character evidence offered by his coworkers. I considered his alcohol \nrecovery efforts and his current participation in AA. However, I am concerned with \nApplicant\u2019s apparent inconsistency about when he stopped drinking and his admitted \nprobation violations. I fail to see that Applicant has changed his lifestyle in any \nmeaningful way so that future alcohol related incidents are less likely to occur. \nApplicant\u2019s actions raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under the Alcohol \nConsumption guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant committed three separate alcohol-related driving offenses in August\n2006, October 2007, and November 2007. He has consumed alcohol, at times to\nexcess and the point of intoxication, since about 1980. He resumed drinking after\ncompleting court-ordered alcohol treatment in October 2008, despite meeting the\ncriteria for dependence. The evidence is insufficient to mitigate resulting security\nconcerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 2, 2008.  On April\n1\n30, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n2\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nFebruary 8, 2011\n\nItem 4.\n3\nThe Government submitted 14 Items in support of the SOR allegations. \n4\nItem 5.\n5\nItem 4.\n6\nItems 7 and 8.\n7\nItems 4 and 6.\n8\n2\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 20, 2010, and requested that his\ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.3\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on July 7, 2010. A\ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n4\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non July 25, 2010, and returned it to DOHA. He provided no further response to the\nFORM within the 30-day period, did not request additional time to respond, and\nexpressed no objection to my consideration of the evidence submitted by Department\nCounsel. I received the case assignment on October 12, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has never held a\nsecurity clearance. He is twice divorced, with two adult children. He has worked for his\ncurrent employer since January 2006 as a program manager. Prior to that, he worked\nfor 11 years as a consultant in the software and computer information systems field, in\nwhich he holds a bachelor of science degree.  In his response to the SOR, he admitted\n5\neach allegation.  Applicant\u2019s admissions, including his responses to DOHA\n6\ninterrogatories and his affidavit to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),  are\n7\nincorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant began drinking alcohol in approximately 1980, and admittedly\ncontinued to do so, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, until at least June\n4, 2010, when he answered the SOR. He said that he had not drunk to the point of\nintoxication since May 2008, when he entered a court-ordered outpatient treatment\nprogram after his third arrest for operating a vehicle while impaired/under the influence\nof alcohol (OVI) in 16 months.  \n8\n\nItems 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n9\nItems 4, 6, 7, 10, and 14.\n10\n3\nDuring August 2006, Applicant left a bar at around 1:00 am on a weekend night,\nafter drinking numerous beers and shots of vodka over the preceding eight hours. He\nrealized that he was impaired, but thought he was sober enough to drive. On the way\nhome, he lost control while rounding a curve and his car flipped over into a ditch. He\nadmitted that he had been drinking to the state trooper who responded to the accident\nscene, and failed a field sobriety test. He took a breathalyzer test that revealed his\nblood-alcohol concentration (BAC) was 0.25. After initially pleading not guilty on August\n14, 2006, he pled guilty to OVI on January 3, 2007, and was sentenced to 180 days in\njail (177 days suspended), a fine and costs totaling $596, suspension of his driver\u2019s\nlicense for a year, and three years of probation. He was also ordered to complete a\nthree-day alcohol intervention program, which he successfully finished on February 18,\n2007. His counselor found no evidence of alcohol dependence, and recommended no\nfurther treatment. The court accepted his probation officer\u2019s recommendation, and\nreleased him from probation on July 20, 2007.9\nDuring October 2007, Applicant again left a bar after drinking beer for about six\nhours. He decided to drive home using back roads, and became lost. He eventually\nstopped and got out of his car to determine where he was. A passing state trooper\nstopped to assist him, and detected the odor of alcohol. Applicant admitted that he had\nbeen drinking but, after failing a field sobriety test, refused to participate in a\nbreathalyzer test. He stated that this refusal was based on advice from the attorney who\nassisted him in dealing with his prior OVI conviction. He was arrested, and subsequently\nfound guilty of having physical control of a vehicle while under the influence. He was\nsentenced in March 2008 to pay a fine and to serve 180 days in jail (177 days\nsuspended) and two years of reporting probation. He was further ordered to cease\nalcohol consumption, obtain an alcohol evaluation, and comply with any recommended\ntreatment program.10\nOn November 21, 2007, shortly after midnight, Applicant left a bar at which he\nhad been drinking during the preceding six hours. He said that he only had three or four\nbeers during that period, and stopped drinking beer several hours before he left to\nensure that he was sober enough to drive home. He was pulled over by a state trooper\nshortly thereafter. When the trooper told him that he failed the field sobriety test, he\nagain refused to submit to a breathalyzer and was arrested. On June 19, 2008, he pled\nguilty to OVI -Refusal (of the breath test), and was sentenced to 180 days confinement\n(170 days suspended), fined $425, three years of unsupervised probation, and an 18-\nmonth suspension of his driver\u2019s license. He was also ordered to undergo alcohol\ntreatment. On February 6, 2009, the court found that the conditions of his probation had\nbeen met, and ordered that he be released from probation effective that date. On\nAugust 19, 2008, the court that sentenced Applicant for his October 2007 offense\nsentenced him to serve the suspended 177 days in jail, but suspended 174 days and\ngave him credit for the other three days served in jail for the November 2007 offense. It\n\nItems 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13.\n11\nItem 12.\n12\nItems 4 and 7.\n13\n4\nalso ordered him to complete the alcohol counseling program he had begun on May 30,\n2008, after which he would be eligible to convert to non-reporting probation.11\nApplicant successfully completed his outpatient alcohol counseling and treatment\nprogram on October 1, 2008. His counselor, a licensed social worker, provided a\ndischarge summary in which he said that Applicant met the criteria for an alcohol\ndependence diagnosis, but appeared to be highly functioning and able to carry out\nnormal responsibilities. He further stated, \u201cAlthough total abstinence is always the\npreferred course when a substance dependence diagnosis is made, [Applicant] believes\nhe will be able to control his drinking in the future. Therefore, the focus of his recovery\nplan was on learning to set appropriate limits for his drinking and staying within those\nlimits.\u201d  Applicant resumed drinking after completing treatment, although not to the\n12\npoint of intoxication, and intends to continue to consume alcohol on a social basis.  \n13\nApplicant provided no evidence concerning the quality of his professional\nperformance, the level of responsibility his duties entail, or his track record with respect\nto handling sensitive information and observation of security procedures. He submitted\nno character references or other evidence tending to establish good judgment,\ntrustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or\ncharacter in person since he elected to have his case decided without a hearing. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n5\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant\nor proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to\nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides:\n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Two DCs supported by the SOR allegations and asserted by Department\nCounsel are:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\n\nTo the contrary, Department Counsel expressed in a footnote that the record evidence was not sufficient\n14\nto establish that Applicant had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent. (FORM at 5.) \n6\nThere is also substantial evidence that would support application of two additional DCs\nunder AG \u00b6 22:\n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program; and\n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion\nof an alcohol treatment program.\nHowever, only the first two DCs will be considered here because the FORM did not\nprovide notice of the potential application of these latter provisions.  Applicant\u2019s three\n14\narrests and convictions for OVI and having physical control of a vehicle while under the\ninfluence support security concerns under AG \u00b6 22(a). Those incidents, together with\nhis admission that he has consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of\nintoxication since about 1980, support application of AG \u00b6 22(c). Accordingly, the\nburden is shifted to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security concerns.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security\nconcerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\n\n7\nApplicant was involved in three alcohol-related driving offenses during a 16-\nmonth period, the most recent of which was about three years ago. None of these\noccurred under unusual circumstances. His choice to resume alcohol consumption,\nafter completing a court-ordered treatment program during which he was found to meet\nthe criteria for alcohol dependence, precludes a finding that such incidents are unlikely\nto recur. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 23(a) does not provide mitigation.\nApplicant asserts that he has not consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication\nsince May 2008, but his track record of self-evaluating his level of sobriety is\nquestionable given his three alcohol-related driving arrests. The record evidence\nsuggests that he meets the criteria for alcohol dependence, which he has neither\nacknowledged nor established a pattern of abstinence. Insufficient time has passed to\nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(b), given the duration and nature of his history of\nalcohol abuse. Similarly, there is not sufficient evidence to support mitigation under AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 23(c) and (d). Applicant resumed drinking after his most recent alcohol treatment\nprogram, and failed to submit documentation of participation in counseling or treatment\nsince then. He provided no current favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional or social worker. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a well-educated,\nmature, accountable adult who voluntarily chose to engage in the conduct of concern.\nThis conduct has spanned the past thirty years, and continues to date. He committed\nthree alcohol-related driving offenses in 2006 and 2007, and resumed drinking after his\n2008 court-ordered alcohol treatment program. The likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence of irresponsible conduct and the ongoing potential for exploitation or duress\n\n8\nhave not been refuted. He did not demonstrate rehabilitation or other permanent\nbehavioral changes. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nJeff Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant:\nJoseph Testan, Esquire\nJuly 27, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on July 30, 2008. (Government Exhibit 1.) On February 22, 2010, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and D (Sexual Behavior)\nconcerning Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 15, 2010, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\n\n2\non April 19, 2010. This case was assigned to me on April 22, 2010.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on May 3, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 9,\n2010. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two additional witnesses,\nand submitted Applicant Exhibits A through K, which were also received without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing, and the record closed, on June\n29, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nAt the request of both parties, Official Notice was taken of various state criminal\nstatutes referenced in this case. Copies of the statutes in question are included in the\nrecord as Official Notice Documents I and II. (Transcript at 39-43.)\nAmendment to the SOR\nOn April 22, 2010, the Department Counsel sent a \u201cNotice of Amendment to the\nStatement of Reasons\u201d to the Applicant. The Government proposed to amend the SOR\nby adding an allegation under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. In a letter dated May 3,\n2010, Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to the amendment. \nAt the hearing in this matter, both parties were heard. Applicant\u2019s objection was\noverruled and the SOR amended to add Paragraph 3 under Guideline E. (Transcript at\n54-58.) The impact of this amendment will be discussed under \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d and\n\u201cConclusions,\u201d below.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 27 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct.\nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in inappropriate or illegal sexual behavior, which is\nrelated to his criminal conduct.\n\n3\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because his criminal conduct, and related sexual behavior, shows poor\njudgment, irresponsibility or untrustworthiness.\nIn late 2007, Applicant became involved in an internet relationship with a person\nwho turned out to be a 15 year old boy (Boy). The Boy had indicated over the internet\nthat he was interested in having a sexual relationship with an older man. At that time\nApplicant was 24. \nApplicant and the Boy soon began meeting each other in person. Applicant\nstated to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management:\nSome time after, exact date is unknown, [the Boy] initiated some\ngroping. Some time after, exact date is unknown, things progressed, and\n[the Boy] and I had oral sex on 2 occasions. On both occasions, [the Boy]\nand I performed oral sex on each other. Both sexual encounters occurred\nseveral months apart in my vehicle. (Government Exhibit 3 at 1.)\nApplicant was subsequently arrested by the police and charged with 1) Lewd Act\nUpon Dependent Adult, 2) Oral Copulation With Person Under 16, and 3) Lewd Act\nAgainst Child 14/15, all felonies.  On December 9, 2008, he plead guilty to an amended\ncharge of Oral Copulation with a Person Under Age of 18, a misdemeanor. On January\n30, 2009, he was sentenced to three years probation, fined, 20 days of community\nservice, and ordered to complete one year of therapy. (Government Exhibits 4 and 7;\nApplicant Exhibit J.)\nApplicant made a motion to have his probation terminated early by the court. The\nmotion was successful, and the probation was terminated on May 27, 2010. (Applicant\nExhibit I.) Applicant also completed the one year of therapy on December 16, 2009.\n(Applicant Exhibit A.)\nAt the recommendation of his primary therapist, Applicant has continued therapy\nwith a clinical psychologist. As of May 29, 2010, Applicant and the psychologist had 18\nsessions together. The psychologist writes:\nWhile [Applicant] had initially taken some responsibility for his\ninappropriate sexual acts, he saw himself as the passive recipient of his\nunderage victim\u2019s sexual advances. He now understands that he was in\nthe powerful position as a result of his age. [Applicant\u2019s] taking, clear\nunequivocal responsibility for his role in this affair is a noteworthy step.\n.      .      .\n[Applicant] should continue in therapy for an extended period of\ntime. I believe that with support, greater insight, and attendant social skills\n\nApplicant\u2019s written description, and hearing testimony, frankly describes the course of his relationship with\n1\nthe Boy. For purposes of this Decision, while it is unnecessary to describe the relationship in depth, I have\nconsidered all of the evidence in making this Decision.\n4\ntraining, the chance of a recurrence of his illegal sexual acts is quite low. I\nsay this with confidence partly because of the advances he has already\nmade, and partly because his arrest and the potential consequences for\nhis future life have seriously frightened him. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) (See\nTranscript at 74-75.)\nAt the hearing, Applicant was asked why he didn\u2019t end his relationship with the\nBoy after each sexual contact, when he admitted knowing the contact was illegal. He\nsaid, \u201cIt felt good. I enjoyed it. It fulfilled some sort of need with me and I don\u2019t think I\nwas really thinking about it too much either.\u201d (Transcript at 186.) (See Transcript at 67,\n144.)1\nMitigation\nApplicant\u2019s father, and a friend, testified for him. Applicant is described as a good\nson, who understands the issues of what he did. (Transcript at 12.) His friend describes\nApplicant as someone who is \u201cvery responsible, very ethical.\u201d (Transcript at 19.)\nA letter was also submitted from his step-mother.  She states that he is \u201creliable\nand trustworthy.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit H.) \nApplicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly respected\nemployee.  (Applicant Exhibits E and F.) Evidence was also submitted showing that the\nApplicant kept his employer fully and promptly informed of the proceedings in this case.\n(Government Exhibit 5; Applicant Exhibits D and G.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision. In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own common sense,\n\n5\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\n\n6\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG\n\u00b6 12:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion,\nor which may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No adverse\ninference concerning the standards of this Guideline may be raised solely\non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe Applicant was involved in criminal, sexual activity with a minor in 2007/2008,\nwhich resulted in the Applicant being arrested, charged with three felonies, and\nconvicted of a misdemeanor.  AG \u00b6 31(a) under Guideline J applies to this case, stating\nthat a disqualifying condition is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nTwo of the mitigating conditions also may apply and have been considered.\nThey are AG \u00b6 32(a ), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d; and AG\n\u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d \nThe Applicant\u2019s sexual misconduct occurred just over two years ago. His\nprobation was just terminated just shortly before the hearing. While the Applicant does\ntake some responsibility for his acts, his testimony, and the letter from his psychologist,\nshow a man who has had great difficulty admitting his actions with an underage child\nwere wrong, and his fault. Not enough time has passed for me to be sure similar\nmisconduct will not occur in the future. Paragraph 1 is found against the Applicant.\nTurning to Guideline D, I find that all of the disqualifying conditions apply to this\ncase. AG \u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual\nhas been prosecuted\u201d; AG \u00b6 13(b), \u201ca pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high\nrisk sexual behavior that the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder\u201d; AG \u00b6 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be\n\n7\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress\u201d; and \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual behavior of a public\nnature and/or that reflects a lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d\nThe evidence shows that Applicant engaged in an inappropriate sexual\nrelationship with an underaged person. It was criminal, high risk sexual behavior that\nwas symptomatic of a personality disorder. In addition, by its very nature it subjected the\nApplicant to possible coercion, exploitation or duress. Finally, in that the sexual acts\noccurred in his automobile they were of a public nature. Finally, the entire relationship\nreflects a severe lack of judgment.\nI have examined the mitigating conditions and find that only AG \u00b6 14(c)\nmarginally applies, \u201cthe behavior no long serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation or\nduress.\u201d The Applicant has kept his employer, and through them the Government, fully\ninformed of the progress in his case.\nAG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. That condition states it may be mitigating when \u201cthe\nsexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual\ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The incidents in this case\noccurred slightly over two years ago. As described above, the Applicant\u2019s treating\npsychologist states Applicant requires an extensive period of treatment, and only now\nhas begun to understand his responsibility as a then 24 year old for having sex with a\n15 year old. I find that the conduct continues to cast doubt on the Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment. Paragraph 2 is found against the Applicant.\nFinally, concerning the Personal Conduct allegation, Paragraph 3. AG \u00b6 16 sets\nforth potentially disqualifying conditions, none of which are independently supported by\nthis record. However, to the extent that Appellant\u2019s sexual misconduct and criminal\noffense involved questionable judgment, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, they can also be considered to support security concerns under AG \u00b6 15.\nAs discussed above, Applicant\u2019s sexual and criminal conduct did involve questionable\njudgment and unwillingness to comply with criminal laws.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security\nconcerns. For the same reasons that the equivalent mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines J and D were not established, as discussed above, Applicant failed to\ndemonstrate mitigation under any of the Guideline E mitigating conditions, particularly\nAG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d; and \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken\npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress.\u201d\n\n8\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge must consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant engaged in a criminal,\nsexual relationship with an underaged person slightly more than two years ago. Under\nAG \u00b6 2(a)(3), Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  After examining the record, I find the\nApplicant lacked maturity at the time of the event, and still shows a significant lack of\nmaturity today. AG \u00b6 2(a)4) applies. Based on the state of the record, and as stated in\ndepth above, I cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under\nAG \u00b6 2(a)(6). That is particularly so when his own psychologist indicates that a lengthy,\ncontinued period of treatment is appropriate. Accordingly, at the present time, I find that\nthere is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and\nthat there is a high likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct, sexual behavior, and personal conduct.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a denial of his request for a security clearance. Accordingly,\nParagraphs 1, 2 and 3 are found against the Applicant.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 73-year-old businessman with over 40 years of advanced experience in naval aviation, surveillance, and entrepreneurship. He has worked for his current employer for about five years, although his current professional focus is on a small, non-defense related business he recently founded. He has served as president 2 of multiple companies and is currently a consultant on DOD issues. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and completed extensive graduate coursework. Honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy in 1970, he is currently single and the father of five adult children. He is civically active in various conservation and preservation initiatives. In early 1990, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Because of the \u201csubstantial assets\u201d held by himself and his consulting firm, the court converted the filing to a Chapter 11 proceeding.

The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992),\nas amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD\non September 1, 2006. \nIn an April 15, 2010, response, Applicant admitted seven of the nine allegations\nraised under Guideline F and two of the three allegations raised under Guideline E.\nApplicant requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. DOHA assigned\nthe case to me on September 1, 2010. The parties proposed a hearing date of October\n5, 2010. A notice setting that date for the hearing was issued on September 8, 2010. I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony and presented 18\ndocuments for consideration, which were accepted without objection as exhibits (Exs.)\nA-R. Department Counsel offered 32 documents, which were admitted as exhibits\n(Exs.) 1-32 without objection. \nJune 29, 2011\n\n Admissions to the additional allegations were noted at Tr. 174. See also Tr. 160-173. In addition, the\n      1\nGovernment provided a copy of the precise wording of the additional allegations on October 18, 2010, to\nApplicant and myself. No objections were timely submitted and that wording is adopted herein.\n Applicant last worked for his current employer in about October 2009. See Tr. 131-132.\n      2\n Tr. 21. SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a incorrectly notes the filing as a Chapter 7 petition. \n      3\n Tr. 22.\n      4\n2\nDuring the hearing, it was noted that Applicant had not filed federal tax returns\nfor tax years 2006 through 2009, and federal tax returns for his business for tax years\n2006 through 2008. Consequently, the SOR was amended to include his admissions as\nallegations 1.j and 1.k under Guideline F to conform the allegations with the evidence.1\nApplicant was given until November 11, 2010, to submit any additional documents for\nconsideration. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on October 22, 2010.\nAdditional documents were submitted by Applicant between October 14, 2010, and\nNovember 7, 2010. They were forwarded to me without objection on November 16,\n2010, and accepted as Exs. S-V. The record was then closed. Based on a review of the\ntestimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden of\nmitigating financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 73-year-old businessman with over 40 years of advanced\nexperience in naval aviation, surveillance, and entrepreneurship. He has worked for his\ncurrent employer for about five years, although his current professional focus is on a\nsmall, non-defense related business he recently founded.  He has served as president\n2\nof multiple companies and is currently a consultant on DOD issues. Applicant earned a\nbachelor\u2019s degree and completed extensive graduate coursework. Honorably\ndischarged from the U.S. Navy in 1970, he is currently single and the father of five adult\nchildren. He is civically active in various conservation and preservation initiatives. \nIn early 1990, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Because of the\n\u201csubstantial assets\u201d held by himself and his consulting firm, the court converted the\nfiling to a Chapter 11 proceeding.  Bankruptcy protection had been sought due to a\n3\n\u201cvery nasty\u201d 1988 divorce and a division of property that excluded his estranged wife\u2019s\nconsiderable out-of-state investments, which made the \u201cmathematics completely\nunbalanced.\u201d  He eventually met his divorce decree obligations through a conservation\n4\neasement on property owned in-state. Substantial legal problems in making the\nconveyance, however, delayed his receipt of funds to meet the decree\u2019s mandates,\nforcing him to seek bankruptcy protection.\n\n Tr. 72-73, 106-108, 135, 139. Such debts, usually related to credit cards, are distinguished by Applicant\n      5\nfrom those debts which are collateralized or collateralized with recourse. Collateralized debts are referenced\nas \u201cmeaning automobile loans.\u201d See Tr. 72.\n Tr. 103.\n      6\n Tr. 103-104.\n      7\n Tr. 105-106; Ex. S (Circuit Court order, dated Sep. 21, 2010). See also Ex. Q (Settlement agreement) for\n      8\ncomparison of addresses of property at issue.\n Id.; see also  Ex.

Unpaid. The issuer cut off Applicant\u2019s access to\nthe credit card. Applicant does not intend to pay this obligation because of a dispute he\nhas with the issuer over another credit card suspended or closed by this same issuer.6\n1.c \u2013 Charged-off account for a balance of approximately $21,984. Unpaid. Applicant\ndoes not dispute that he owes the balance at issue, but has a separate dispute with the\nissuer. He claims the issuer released information about him to a collection agency\nimproperly. He may sue the issuer for this disclosure in the future, but has yet to do so.7\n1.d \u2013 Past-due equity account in the approximate amount of $22,988 on an account in\nforeclosure status with a total loan balance of about $227,000. Sold; recourse against\nApplicant waived for any balances owed. Applicant provided evidence that this property\nwas sold to a bank through auction on September 9, 2010.  There is no evidence as to\n8\nwhether there was any balance owed on the underlying loan, nor was a 1099 form for\nthe sale offered. However, a notice of settlement agreement was introduced showing\nthat the creditor waived its right to pursue a deficiency against Applicant.  \n9\n1.e \u2013 Charged-off account in the approximate amount of $25,000. Unpaid. This\nacknowledged debt was ultimately secured in a judgment in about 2009 and is deemed\nby him to be uncollateralized.  \n10\n1.f \u2013 Charged-off auto account for approximately $8,047. Unpaid. Applicant\nacknowledges this debt. He deems this debt to be uncollateralized and, therefore, not\nan immediate priority in terms of his overall debt.11\n1.g \u2013 Past-due mortgage account in the approximate amount of $80,755 on an\naccount in foreclosure status with a total loan balance of about $370,000.

This property is the same as the one noted above at 1.d. Applicant\nprovided credible evidence that the property at issue was sold by the lender after he\nattempted to sell it through short sale. It auctioned for about $290,000, but the lender\nhad difficulty obtaining legal title to the property  No final certificate of title was\n12\nproduced. However, the evidence provided indicates that Applicant has and is actively\nworking on the final resolution of this debt and the debt noted at 1.d.\n1.h \u2013 Charged-off account for approximately $21,374. Unpaid. Applicant\nacknowledges this debt and categorizes it with other uncollateralized debts owed.\n1.i \u2013 Mortgage account that went into foreclosure with a deficiency of approximately\n$117,000. Loan modified, but account delinquent. Applicant testified that this property\nwas subject to a June 2009 home mortgage modification shown as signed by him, but\nnot by the lender.  As evidence that the loan was modified, he showed payments on\n13\nthe loan at the modified rate through December 2009.  He then ceased making\n14\npayments on the modified loan because the lender was \u201crefusing to sign the loan mod\n[sic] and they are refusing to give [him] a [comprehensive] 1099 for the interest and\ntaxes paid.\u201d  There is no evidence that he has tried to remedy this issue.\n15\n1.j/1.k \u2013 Failure to file federal income tax returns, as required, for tax years 2006,\n2007, 2008, and 2009, and failure to file federal tax returns for his business, as\nrequired, for at least tax years 2006, 2007, and 2008.  No evidence of filings. The\n16\nquestion of whether these filings were made was raised at the hearing.  Applicant\n17\nconceded that filings were not made for some, if not all, of the years at issue.  He was\n18\ngiven 37 days to submit evidence showing that any filings were made, but no evidence\nwas submitted.  He explained that filings were not made due to his difficult tax situation\n19\nand because he believed he could take his \u201cjolly time\u201d in filing, when no taxes were\ndue.20\nApplicant was again divorced in April 2007. He described that divorce as \u201cvery\namicable\u201d and did not prove that any of his current debts were the direct result of that\ndivorce, although he noted that his available resources began \u201cdrying up between 2007\n\n Tr. 71-72. During that same time frame, Applicant\u2019s consulting business was administratively dissolved,\n      21\nas discussed below.\n Tr. 162-163.\n      22\n Tr. 125.\n      23\n Tr. 131.\n      24\n Tr. 132. Applicant reinvests much of the company\u2019s earning into building the business.\n      25\n Tr. 140.\n      26\n Tr. 134.\n      27\n Tr. 135.\n      28\n The $164 figure, based on the sums noted during Applicant\u2019s testimony, is calculated with the expectation\n      29\nthat no profits are reinvested into the business and are, instead, applied to Applicant\u2019s personal income. He\ndid not note any other holdings that he intended to use to supplement this figure or to devote toward his debts.\n Tr. 141-142.\n      30\n Id. Applicant negotiated a 50-month plan of $100 monthly payments, but he withdrew from the plan after\n      31\nabout a year when the creditor demanded full payment of the balance on the  $4,000-$4,500 debt. Applicant\nprovided no evidence showing that this debt is the same as the one at \u00b6 1.f.\n Tr. 140.\n      32\n5\nand 2008.\u201d  No medical issues have adversely impacted his finances.  He has\n21\n22\nmortgaged rental properties that basically pay for themselves through seasonal\ntenants.  He receives $1,377 per month in Social Security payments. He was earning\n23\napproximately $3,000 a month from his current employer, but voluntarily ceased taking\nassignments and earning income from that entity in about October 2009.  His small\n24\nbusiness venture earns him approximately $2,000 a month.  He hopes to make this\n25\nsmall business more successful and profitable.  His monthly living expenses are about\n26\n$3,213.  Consequently, through around October 2009, he had a net monthly remainder\n27\nin excess of $3,100, which was more recently reduced by the subtraction of about\n$3,000 in current income generated from his present employer.  Currently, his income\n28\nfrom the small business and Social Security barely exceeds his monthly living expenses\nby approximately $164, but he hopes his small business will soon flourish.  He\n29\npreviously co-signed on a vehicular loan for his brother who later defaulted on the loan.\nThe vehicle was then repossessed.  Applicant was making payments on his obligation\n30\nto this lender, but has since stopped.  In describing his current financial situation as a\n31\n\u201cdynamic situation,\u201d he noted: \u201cI\u2019m clawing for survival and as far as I can figure out I\u2019m\non the uphill part of the slope, not the downhill part of the slope.\u201d   \n32\nAlso at issue are certain business practices involving Applicant. In 2005,\nApplicant had an agreement to do consulting work for one entity while he was serving\nas president of another company. He testified that he gave notice of his arrangement to\n\n Tr. 146-152.\n      33\n Tr. 156-157.\n      34\n Tr. 156. The SOR (\u00b6 2.a) alleges that he resigned as President due to a potential conflict of interest.\n      35\nThere is no evidence that an actual conflict of interest resulted or that successful action was subsequently\ntaken against Applicant. His current financial issues predated his departure. See Tr. 101.\n Tr. 159; Ex. H (Memorandum regarding reinstatement, dated Sep. 24, 2009).\n      36\n Id. See also Ex. H, in general.\n      37\n Tr. 159-160. See SOR allegation \u00b6 2.b.\n      38\n Ex. H (State Business Corporation Act excerpt, eff. Sep. 4, 1999, at subsection c). At the time of the\n      39\nhearing, reinstatement had not been initiated in an effort to preserve financial resources. Tr. 160. However,\ncorrespondence by counsel with the state shows that inquiry was been made as to how the reinstatement\ncould be effectuated. See Ex. H (Law firm, letter of Sep. 29, 2009).\n Tr. 161-162.\n      40\n6\nhis company.  His relationship with the firm for which he provided consulting became\n33\nan issue in 2006 with his company. At a board meeting, he tried to explain his\nrelationship with the entity and his attempts to partition himself, but his explanations\nwere not accepted. The meeting\u2019s atmosphere was hostile, and he felt at least one of\nthe officers had a grudge against him and his management.  To \u201cget away from the\n34\nwhole mess,\u201d he offered his resignation.35\nIn addition, Applicant last filed corporate papers for his consulting firm in about\n2005. It was administratively dissolved by the state on August 29, 2008.  Under state\n36\nlaw, the entity continued its corporate existence, but could not conduct any business\nexcept with regard to matters winding up the entity\u2019s existence.  There \u201cwere a couple\n37\nof weeks difference between\u201d the time the business was administratively dissolved and\nthe time it terminated its contract with one of its clients.  There is no evidence that this\n38\noverlap was intentional or that all parties had receipt of the dissolution at the time.\nMoreover, Applicant has until August 29, 2011, to reinstate the corporate charter. In the\ninterim, the entity is in \u201climbo\u201d for the wrap-up of business. There is also an alternative\nprocedure for reinstating beyond August 29, 2011. Either process permits a reinstated\ncharter to effectively date back to the date of dissolution, permitting the entity to carry\nforward as if the dissolution had never occurred.39\nFinally, Applicant did not report earnings for the consulting firm to the state for\ntax years 2007 and 2008, the year of the corporation\u2019s dissolution and the year prior to\nits dissolution by the state. Applicant initially asserted that this was because there were\nno earnings, but the evidence shows that the entity was issued a 1099 from one client,\nwhich suggests earnings may have been accrued. He admits this allegation, as found at\nSOR allegation \u00b6 2.c. At the hearing, He testified that his representatives have been\nworking on this issue for the past few years. They had only received the final\ndocuments necessary to comprise the filings in the past couple of weeks. To date, that\nentity is still in the \u201climbo\u201d status described above. Applicant testified that extensions\nwere filed for the years in question, but no evidence to that effect was submitted.40\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      41\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      42\n Id.\n      43\n7\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all reliable information about\nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n41\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n42\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about\npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n43\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\n\n Id.\n      44\n AG \u00b6 18.\n      45\n Id.\n      46\n8\ninformation.  Based upon consideration of the evidence, Guideline F (Financial\n44\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are the most pertinent to this\ncase. Conditions pertaining to these AGs that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and\ndiscussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  It\n45\nalso states that \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  \n46\nAside from the 21-year-old bankruptcy, Applicant admits to over $77,700 in\nunpaid debts (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h), default status since December\n2009 on one mortgage with a total loan amount of approximately $117,000 (SOR\nallegation \u00b6 1.i), a comparatively minor balance on a repossessed  vehicle, and a failure\nto file personal and business taxes for multiple years over the past decade. Such facts\nare sufficient to raise Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(g) (failure to file annual Federal,\nstate, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same). With\nsuch conditions raised, it is left to Applicant to overcome the case against him and\nmitigate security concerns. \nThe delinquent debts at issue are multiple in number. The majority of those\ndebts remain unpaid and amount to over $77,700. Applicant\u2019s reason for failing to\naddress these debts stems from their being \u201cuncollateralized.\u201d The AG, however,\nmakes no distinctions between the types of one\u2019s admitted delinquent obligations.\nMoreover, there is no evidence that he has formally disputed the facts underlying his\nrefusal to honor his modified loan and continue making payments on one mortgage.\nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s argument that he could take his \u201cjolly time\u201d in filing his taxes is\nincompatible with the expectations of one seeking a security clearance. The standard to\nwhich one seeking access to sensitive material is held requires a higher degree of\ncompliance in terms of one\u2019s obligations to the IRS and general business conduct.\nApplicant\u2019s footloose and cavalier attitude does not rise to that standard. Finally, there\nis no evidence he has tried to resolve any of his disagreements with his creditors\nthrough formal dispute or legal action. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition\n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n      47\n Id.\n      48\n9\n(FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s 1988 divorce may have contributed to his 1990 bankruptcy,\nthose incidents occurred over two decades ago. There is no evidence that his amicable\n2007 divorce adversely affected his finances. There is no evidence that significant debt\nwas acquired due to essential medical services. Moreover, Applicant voluntarily left his\nposition as president of his former company and, on his own volition, temporarily\nceased taking on work and generating income with his present employer. Given these\nand other facts presented, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances) only applies to any residual debts\nrelated to the 1988 divorce, if any.\nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling, only that he\nhas relied on accountants and other professionals. To date, significant debt remains\nunaddressed. Attempts to address some of those debts have been sporadic, at best.\nSuch facts obviate application of FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control).\nApplicant initiated efforts to repay the debts at SOR allegation \u00b61.i and his\nbrother\u2019s vehicular repossession, but he later quit making payments on those debts.\nLacking evidence of formal disputes with those creditors, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d), (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts) does not apply. That mitigating condition only has application to the debts at \u00b6\u00b6\n1.d and 1.g. Taken collectively in terms of all of Applicant\u2019s debts at issue, this\nmitigating condition has limited application. No other mitigating conditions apply.\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns arise from matters of personal conduct because \u201cconduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201c  In addition, \u201cany failure to\n47\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process\u201d is of special interest.  \n48\nHere, Applicant admits that his consulting company continued to conduct\nbusiness with a client a few weeks after the company had been administratively\ndissolved and that his business failed to file state tax returns for 2007 and 2008, despite\nhaving been issued a 1099 form. Such facts, if true, could be sufficient to raise PC DC\n\n It is noted that this disqualifying condition is a catch-all category for personal conduct unrelated to conduct\n      49\ncovered by other guidelines. The conduct at issue in SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c concern three distinctly\ndifferent acts whose only nexus is that they take place in a business context.\n10\nAG \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information, supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive\ncorporate or other government protected information). . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or\nrule violations).  With a disqualifying condition raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to\n49\nmitigate security concerns.\nAs a preliminary matter, SOR allegation \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant resigned as\npresident of his company in 2006 due to a potential conflict of interest between his\ncompany and an entity with which he had an active consulting agreement. Although\nApplicant denies the allegation as written, he credibly stated that his company knew of\nhis consulting arrangement. He concedes that when disagreements and personality\nconflicts emerged in the boardroom about the arrangement, he chose to quit rather than\nfurther defend his position. Despite semantic differences, the result is the same. There\nis no conclusive evidence, however, that an actual conflict of interest ever arose or that\nany business irregularities occurred that necessitated any form of adverse action.\nIndeed, under these facts, Applicant demonstrated good judgment in appropriately\nsevering his connection with one of the two entities when the appearance of a potential\nconflict came to the fore. Therefore, none of the disqualifying conditions apply to this\nallegation. \nThe overlap between the time of Applicant\u2019s business\u2019s administrative dissolution\nand the cessation of client-oriented work was a matter of \u201ca couple of weeks.\u201d The\nexact dates of this overlap are imprecise, and the period is significantly brief. there is no\nevidence that work was intentionally done with knowledge of the state\u2019s action, and the\nstate has not interceded to penalize Applicant or the business for this residual conduct.\nAt best, this overlap is an oversight; at worst, these facts represent a de minimis\nviolation that occurred four years ago through the conduct of the corporate entity, not\nApplicant. Therefore, AG \u00b6 17 (c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed,\nor the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. \nAlthough the burden in these proceedings is placed squarely on the Applicant,\nApplicant testified that his accountants have been working on his corporation\u2019s taxes on\nan ongoing basis, that they only recently received all the necessary information to\ncomplete the filings, and that extensions for the years at issue were filed. While\nadministratively dissolved, the entity is currently in \u201climbo\u201d pending a grace period to\n\n11\nrevive the business prior to a deadline at the end of August 2011. This limbo period is\nprovided by the state to afford an entity the opportunity to reconnoiter, renew its\nlicensure, or to wrap up its business. There is also an alternative procedure for\nreinstating beyond the three-year period. Either process permits a reinstated charter to\neffectively date back to the date of dissolution, permitting the entity to carry forward as if\nthe dissolution had never occurred. \nWhile no evidence of the accountants\u2019 efforts was introduced for the years\nleading up to, and including, the year of dissolution, there is also no evidence that the\nwindup of the entity\u2019s business is required by the state to be completed before August\n29, 2011. Moreover, the entity still has until that time to seek reinstatement of the\ncorporate charter, an act that would effectively bless any questionable actions that took\nplace within the a few weeks after the dissolution. It seems, therefore, premature to\nconclude that this delay has been inappropriate. AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or\nso much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) substantially applies.\n \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2 (a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based on careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a 73-year-old businessman with over four decades of experience in\ndefense-related issues and entrepreneurship. He is a veteran and is well educated.\nWhile his career has been filled with financial and business successes, he has\nbalanced his time with family-life and an impressive degree of community involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s business interests and experiences are extensive and have, at times,\noverlapped. He has relied on legal and accounting professionals in the conduct of his\nbusiness. Given his decades of professional business experience and the enormity of\nboth his business interests and interactions, the three cited examples of dubious\nbusiness practices are relatively insignificant. This is especially true given the tentative\nnature of administrative corporate dissolutions in the state at issue, a factor directly\nmaking two of the allegations unripe for definitive analysis and most likely explaining\nwhy the state government has not questioned or cited him for the alleged infractions\nnoted in SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. As to the situation in which it was debated\nwhether his business dealing could pose a potential conflict of interest for one of his\nbusinesses (\u00b6 2.a), Applicant acted appropriately under the circumstances by simply\nleaving the company, rather than to proceed working for both entities under a cloud.\nWhether any bona fide or actionable conflicts transpired is unclear. Applicant\u2019s lengthy\n\n12\ntrack record with regard to his business dealings, however, helps support the\nconclusion that any transgressions were unintentional or de minimis. \nLess clear is Applicant\u2019s currently precarious financial situation. While a bitter\ndivorce precipitated his 1990 bankruptcy, that event occurred over two decades ago.\nSince that time, he has not been plagued by medical issues he could not afford. There\nis insufficient evidence showing business downturns so overextended his financial\nresources as to mitigate his acquisition of delinquent debt. His departure from the\npresidency of one company to avoid the appearance of a conflict was voluntary. He\nalso voluntarily ceased working, albeit temporarily, for his present employer. Despite\nconsiderable testimony, the origin of his financial difficulties remains as vague as his\npurported plan for comprehensively addressing his delinquent debts. \nMoreover, there is a minor thread woven through some of Applicant\u2019s debts\nindicating a reluctance to meet his financial obligations on his lenders\u2019 terms (i.e. SOR\nallegations 1.b, 1.c, and his brother\u2019s car repossession). This is particularly true in\ncases where he felt aggrieved by the lender. Such reluctance is worrisome, especially\nsince he failed to produce evidence that he has pursued any recourse against those\nlenders. Meanwhile, he failed to file both professional and personal income taxes on the\ntheory that he could take his \u201cjolly time\u201d when there were no taxes due. As previously\nnoted, such footloose practices are incompatible with one seeking a security clearance.\nIn sum, while this process does not demand that all delinquent debts be paid, it\ndoes require a showing that there is a reasonable plan in place to address such debts\nand evidence of a demonstrated effort to execute that plan. Here, although progress\nwas made on two of the mortgage accounts, Applicant\u2019s approach to the remainder of\nhis debts has been haphazard and inconsistent. While his delinquent accounts may be\nprioritized in terms of collateralization, there is no apparent plan to satisfy the\nuncollateralized accounts at some specified point. Nor is there an explanation as to\nwhy, if such credit card debts are being deferred because they are viewed as being of a\nlesser priority, some of them (i.e. \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c) were initially addressed, but then\nabandoned \u2013 not because of re-prioritization, but because of disputes with the creditors.\nThere is no indication of any progress toward seeking resolution with those lenders he\nrefuses to pay. \nAssuming there is no remaining liability owed on the two main mortgage\naccounts at issue, there remains an outstanding delinquent debt balance of over\n$77,000. There is also a third mortgage (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.i concerning an original\nbalance of about $117,000) on which Applicant chose to stop making payments in\nDecember 2009. Such delinquent debt, independently or taken in conjunction with his\nunfiled tax situation, is significant. Given his present net monthly remainder of\nsignificantly less than $200, there are scant additional funds to make any significant\nprogress on these delinquent debts. Consequently, based on his presentation and\nmaterials, I find that Applicant failed to carry his burden in mitigating security concerns.\nClearance is denied. \n   \n\n13\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance denied.\nARTHUR E.

The record evidence shows\nApplicant\u2019s financial history includes four state tax liens for multiple tax years and one\nfederal tax lien for multiple tax years. In total, the liens amount to more than $37,000 in\nback taxes. He has not paid, settled, or resolved the tax liens. He is not making a good-\nfaith effort to resolve the liens. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided\nagainst Applicant.\nFebruary 24, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to\nthis case. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Exhibit A. \n2\n Exhibit 1. \n3\n Tr. 82. \n4\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on August 19,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether or not to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. In\ndoing so, he admitted the factual allegations addressing the tax liens, and he denied the\nsingle allegation addressing an unpaid collection account based on an apartment lease.\nThe case was assigned to me November 17, 2009. The hearing took place February 3,\n2010. The transcript (Tr.) was received February 12, 2010.   \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR are incorporated herein. Based\non the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence.\nApplicant is a 57-year-old engineer who is seeking an industrial security\nclearance. He has held an interim clearance, without a negative incident, while his case\nwas pending. Applicant held a security clearance many years ago (approximately 1985),\nwhen he was a Sailor in the U.S. Navy.  \n2\nHe has worked as a controls engineer on behalf of a federal contractor since\nabout August 2008, which is when he submitted his security clearance application.  For\n3\n2008, Applicant estimated the gross income for his household (he\u2019s married) at $70,000\nto $80,000; for 2009, he estimated $140,000.4\n\n Exhibit 3. \n5\n Exhibit 3. \n6\n Tr. 66\u201367. \n7\n Tr. 70\u201373. \n8\n Tr. 83. \n9\n Tr. 84. \n10\n Tr. 85. \n11\n Tr. 85\u201386. \n12\n Tr. 84\u201385. \n13\n Exhibit 2. \n14\n3\nApplicant has a history of financial problems that are related to state and federal\nincome taxes. He is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service for approximately $17,652\nin back taxes for tax years 1989, 1990, and 1991. The IRS filed a federal tax lien\nagainst Applicant for that amount in March 1997.  He is indebted to a state tax authority\n5\nfor nearly $20,000 in back taxes for tax years 1984, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1995,\n1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. The state filed a total of four liens against Applicant for\nvarious amounts in 1993, 2001, and 2004.  \n6\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the existence of the liens, but\ncontended the liens were invalid and that he needed to dispute the liens, which would\ntake time and money. At the hearing, he claimed the liens were invalid because they are\nnot based on real or valid information.  He also claimed that he has not been engaged\n7\nin a taxable activity for which he may be held accountable.8\nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted he had not filed an income tax return with the\nIRS since 1991.  He did not recall when he last filed a return with the IRS.  Likewise,\n9\n10\nhe has not filed an income tax return in the state where he has lived and worked since\n2007.  He claimed that he is a resident of Florida,  a state that does not have a\n11\n12\npersonal income tax, although he has not lived and worked in Florida on a full-time\nbasis since 2003. He also admitted that, since beginning his current employment in\n2008, he has not had state or federal income taxes withheld from his paycheck.  \n13\nIn addition to the tax liens, the SOR alleges an unpaid collection account of\n$8,717. Applicant disputes this debt because he does not believe he owes the stated\namount. This debt was incurred in about 2004, when Applicant and his wife vacated an\napartment before the lease expired.  They departed early because his wife was\n14\nexhibiting symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder following the discovery of her\ndeceased sister in the apartment. Applicant vacated the apartment because he believed\n\n Exhibit 2. \n15\n Tr. 46\u201355. \n16\n Department of Navy v.

Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n18\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n19\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n20\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n21\n4\ndoing so was a medical necessity. In a written notice to the landlord, Applicant agreed\nhe was liable for a termination penalty of $3,746 and prorated rent of $664, but disputed\na charge of $3,292 due to insufficient notice.  To date, Applicant has not paid, settled,\n15\nor otherwise resolved any of the debt. \nThe company president testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  The company president\n16\nwas unfamiliar with Applicant\u2019s tax situation, but he was able to provide testimony about\nApplicant\u2019s attributes as an employee. Overall, the company president evaluated\nApplicant as a highly skilled employee who has been a valuable asset to the company. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n17\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n18\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n19\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n20\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n21\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n22\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n23\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n24\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n25\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n26\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n27\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n28\nconditions). \n5\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n22\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n23\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n24\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.25\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.26\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n27\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n28\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n29\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n30\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n31\n ISCR Case No. 94-1153 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 1997) (also, the Board notes and summarizes numerous federal\n32\ncourt decisions that have rejected challenges to the federal tax laws and IRS regulations and practices).\nLikewise, see ISCR Case 98-0810 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000) (the Board notes and summarizes numerous\nfederal court decisions that have rejected challenges to the federal tax laws and IRS regulations and\npractices). \n6\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n29\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems or difficulties as shown by the state and federal tax liens, which represent\napproximately $37,000 in back taxes. This history raises concerns because it indicates\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial\n30\nobligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to\n31\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions, and they suggest financial irresponsibility\nas well.  \nAs I understand his position, Applicant asserts that no law requires him to pay\nstate or federal income taxes because the income he earns from his work does not\namount to a taxable activity. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear, however, that\na security clearance case is not an appropriate forum for contesting the legality of\nincome tax laws:\nIf Applicant wishes to challenge the constitutionality and legality of federal\ntax laws (and IRS regulations and practices), then he must seek redress\nelsewhere. Under the Directive, DOHA Administrative Judges and the\nBoard are authorized to adjudicate industrial security clearance cases, not\nthe constitutionality and legality of federal tax laws and IRS regulations\nand practices. In recognition of the limits of the jurisdiction of DOHA\nAdministrative Judges and this Board under the Directive, the rulings of\nfederal courts on the legality and constitutionality of the federal tax laws\nand IRS practices and procedures must be accepted and applied in DOHA\nproceedings.32\nApplicant has provided no legal authority for his position, and I am aware of no decision\nfrom a state or federal court that supports his position. If he is serious about his position,\nhe needs to seek redress in the appropriate forum.  \n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n33\n Exhibits 4 and 5. \n34\n7\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns.  The six conditions are as follows: \n33\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nConcerning the landlord-tenant debt, Applicant disputes the amount owed, but he\nhas been dilatory in addressing it. Still, Applicant receives credit under \u00b6 20(a) because\n(1) the behavior that resulted in the debt happened several years ago; (2) it is the sole\nconsumer debt at issue as the credit reports  here reflect no other collection or\n34\ncharged-off accounts; and (3) it occurred under usual circumstances\u2014which Applicant\nbelieved amounted to a medical necessity\u2014that are unlikely to recur. Given these\ncircumstances, the landlord-tenant debt by itself or in combination with the tax issues\ndoes not present an undue security concern. On this basis, SOR \u00b6 1.f is decided for\nApplicant.  \n \nConcerning the tax issues, all of the mitigating conditions have been considered\nand none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. In contrary, the tax liens and $37,000 in back taxes\nwere due to circumstances within his control and resulted from his own acts or\nomissions or both. His tax issues are ongoing and likely to continue. The amounts\nspecified in the tax liens are presumed to be accurate, and Applicant did not present\n\n See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted).  \n35\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n36\n8\nany reliable information to challenge or dispute their accuracy. He has not made a\ngood-faith effort to resolve the tax issues. This is demonstrated by, among other things,\nhis failure to file income tax returns, which represents the antithesis of good faith.\nAlthough his failure to file was not alleged in the SOR, I considered it for limited\npurposes, such as: to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed\ncircumstances; to consider if Applicant has demonstrated successful reform and\nrehabilitation; and as part of my whole-person analysis.\n \n35\nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s tax liens and\n$37,000 in back taxes justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthose concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-\nperson concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence. Applicant did not meet his\n36\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is\ndecided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on June 11, 2008 \n(Government Exhibit (GX) 5). On February 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMay 27, 2009\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant received the SOR on February 12, 2009 (GX 3); answered it in an \nundated document; and requested determination on the record without a hearing (GX \n4). Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on March 13, 2009. \nOn March 17, 2009, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to \nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s evidence. Applicant received the FORM \non March 25, 2009, but he did not respond. The case was assigned to me on May 15, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the single allegation in the SOR. \nHis admission is incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is an unmarried 36-year-old field test supervisor employed by a federal \ncontractor since October 2000. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from \nNovember 1994 to October 2000. He received a security clearance at some time in the \npast, but he did not indicate the date he received it on his security clearance application. \nThe record does not reflect whether he currently holds a clearance. \n \n \nApplicant disclosed a delinquent credit card debt of about $30,000 on his security \nclearance application (GX 5 at 18). His credit bureau report (CBR) dated July 10, 2008, \nreflected a delinquent credit card debt of $32,875 that was charged off as a bad debt \nand referred for collection (GX 7 at 4). His CBR dated December 24, 2008, reflected a \ndelinquent credit card debt of about $32,000 (GX 6 at 1). He admitted the debt in his \nanswer to the SOR (GX 4). He has submitted nothing to explain, refute, mitigate, or \nextenuate the adverse information on his two CBRs. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\n \n3\n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges one delinquent credit card debt of about $32,000, and \nApplicant admitted the debt. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as \nfollows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n4\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe potentially disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised by Ainability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by Aa history of not meeting financial \nobligations.@ Applicant\u2019s admission and his two CBRs are sufficient to raise both \ndisqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to him to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). Applicant \nsubmitted no mitigating evidence, and the record establishes none of the enumerated \nmitigating conditions under this guideline. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. My whole person analysis in \nthis case is limited, because the record reflects only the information disclosed by \nApplicant in his security clearance application. He disclosed no information about \nhimself or the circumstances of his indebtedness in his answer to the SOR or his \nresponse to the FORM. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying conditions under Guideline F and the absence of \nmitigating evidence, and having evaluated all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial \nconsiderations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \n\n \n5\nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

She failed to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 1, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On March \n9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as modified and \nrevised.1 The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (Financial \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations \nmade under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nDecember 7, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or \nrevoked. \n \nOn April 15, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested an \nadministrative determination. Department counsel converted the case to a hearing on \nMay 22, 2009. At her hearing, Applicant also requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge (Tr. 20). The case was assigned to me on June 11, 2009. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on June 25, 2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled \non July 14, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 8 (AE 8 was received post-hearing), which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 21, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied all SOR allegations. After a thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old senior systems analyst employed by a defense \ncontractor. She finished high school in 1987. Between 1987 and 2007, she completed \napproximately two years of college, but she has not earned a degree.  \n \nApplicant was hired by her current employer in February 2008, and she received \ninterim access to classified information pending completion of her security background \ninvestigation. This is the first time she has had access to classified information. She is \nthe program manager for a government contract, and supervises a team of software \ndevelopers. There is no evidence that she has ever compromised classified information \nor that she has caused others to do so.  \n \nApplicant married her husband in March 1998 and they were divorced in May \n2004 (GE 1, Tr. 36). She has two sons ages 13 and 17. Her youngest son was born of \nthis marriage and her oldest son is from a prior relationship. Applicant testified she has \nbeen the sole provider for her older child since he was born and the sole provider for the \nyounger child since she separated from her ex-husband in 2001. Applicant testified she \nhas received almost no financial assistance from either father. She maintains her \nchildren in sports and music activities. Her older son is in the process of applying for \n \nProgram (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, \n2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncollege. Applicant intends to provide financial assistance to her son while he attends \ncollege. \n \nApplicant is proud that she has been continuously employed since age 21. She \nbelieves she has done well and that her job progression shows an advancing career \nwith great experience and increasing responsibilities. She testified that, through the \nyears, she has always handled sensitive data and has never misused or \nmisappropriated the information. She considers herself to be an asset to her employer \nand has been awarded the highest compliments from customers and her employer. The \ngovernment customer requested Applicant by name to be assigned to her current \nposition. \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems, past and present, to three main \ncauses: her separation from her ex-husband in 2001 and the subsequent 2004 divorce, \nthe lack of financial support from both fathers of her sons, and her lack of financial \nresponsibility. She admitted she knew her expenses exceeded her income and, \nnotwithstanding, she continued to incur additional debt without paying for the older \ndebts (Tr. 81). Because of her limited income, she could not afford to pay both her past \nfinancial obligations and her current day-to-day living expenses.  \n \nIn her July 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed having \nfinancial problems. Her background investigation addressed her financial status and \nincluded the review of her July 2008 and February 2009 credit bureau reports (CBRs), \nher response to DOHA interrogatories, and her two security clearance applications.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent and/or charged off accounts, totaling \napproximately $36,000. Applicant\u2019s testimony and the record evidence show that all the \nalleged SOR debts are her debts, and they have been delinquent for a number of years.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.k, and 1.l alleged three state tax liens totaling approximately \n$25,588, for taxes owed for tax years 1998 through 2004. Applicant contested the \ncharges and the state conceded their charges were not accurate. The state reduced her \ntax lien debt to $6,129. At her hearing she testified that she was in the process of \nnegotiating a payment plan with the state. After her hearing, Applicant claimed she had \nhired a tax attorney to help her re-file her taxes for the years in question to challenge \nthe state\u2019s tax assessments. She provided no documentary evidence to support her \nassertions. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.m alleged the same debt ($917) in collection by two \ndifferent collection agencies. \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant entered into a debt consolidation program to resolve \nher delinquent obligations. She needed assistance to establish contact with her \ncreditors, negotiate payments, and make a payment plan. Most of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are being paid through her debt consolidation program, including the \n10 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.j, and 1.o. Her documents show she has been \nmaking some progress paying her debts. Based on her payment plan, she anticipates \nbeing debt free in 45 months.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIt is important to Applicant to correct her credit, particularly now with her son \nsoon to enter college. She intends to increase her contributions to her payment plan \nwhen her salary increases. Applicant claimed she paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n; \nhowever, she presented no documentary evidence to support her claim. \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence shows that prior to entering into the debt consolidation \nprogram she negotiated and paid a delinquent $2,396 debt (GE 2, Tr. 49). Applicant \ndisclosed she has two joint delinquent debts for $17,148 and $5,000, which were not \nalleged in the SOR. She and her ex-husband purchased two vehicles that were later \nrepossessed. Applicant believes both she and her ex-husband should be financially \nresponsible for these debts. She is negotiating with him and hopes he will pay part of \nthe debt. She is not making payments on these two debts.  \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for her financial problems. She claimed she has \nlearned from her mistakes and will not repeat them. She believes she is doing all she \ncan do under her circumstances to resolve her debts. She now has a working budget, \nwhich she follows, and she is being more financially responsible. Applicant received \nfinancial counseling through her credit consolidation program. Prior to February 2009, \nshe had not participated in any financial counseling. \n \nIn 2006, Applicant sold her 1998 Ford Explorer and bought a 2005 Nissan Xterra \nfor approximately $28,000. She has a $607 monthly payment she testified that she \ncould barely afford. She explained she made a mistake purchasing such an expensive \nvehicle, but at the time she believed the purchase of the vehicle would assist her to \nreestablish her credit. \n \nAs of February 2009, her monthly take-home pay was around $5,000, with \nmonthly expenses of approximately $4,327. She has been paying approximately $280 a \nmonth into her debt consolidation program, which leaves her a remainder of \napproximately $393 a month. This does not include any payments towards her state tax \ndebt ($6,129), the $22,148 she jointly owes with her ex-husband for the two \nrepossessed vehicles, and future expenses she anticipates she will incur when her son \nenters college.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n2  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent and/or charged-off accounts, totaling \napproximately $36,000. All the alleged SOR debts are Applicant\u2019s debts, and have been \ndelinquent for a number of years.  \n \nApplicant successfully contested three state tax liens totaling approximately \n$25,588, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.k, and 1.l. The state reduced her tax lien debt to \n$6,129. Applicant claimed she hired a tax attorney to help her re-file her taxes for the \nyears in question to challenge the state\u2019s tax assessments. She provided no \ndocumentary evidence to support her assertions. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.m alleged the same \ndebt ($917) in collection by two different collection agencies. AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations) apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n\n \n7 \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant entered into a debt consolidation program to resolve \nher delinquent obligations. The delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through j, and \n1.o, are being paid through her debt consolidation program. She has been making some \nprogress paying her debts. \n \n \nApplicant established circumstances beyond her control contributed to her \ninability to pay her debts, i.e., her marital separation and divorce, and the failure of the \nfathers of her two sons to provide financial support. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but does \nnot fully mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant admitted she made many mistakes \nand that her failure to be financially responsible contributed to her current financial \nproblems. She knew that her debts exceeded her income and, notwithstanding, she \ncontinued to incur additional debt without paying for the old debts. Considering the \nevidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.  \n \n \nSince February 2009, Applicant has made some efforts to resolve her debts. \nNotwithstanding, at this time, her recent efforts are not sufficient to fully mitigate the \nfinancial security concerns. I also find she is barely making ends meet. She is financially \noverextended and her financial problems are not under control. Although Applicant is \naddressing 10 of her debts through a debt consolidation program, she has no plan in \nplace to pay her $6,129 tax lien debt. Additionally, she has three other non-SOR \ndelinquent debts, totaling approximately $22,223, which she has not addressed. \nMoreover, Applicant will soon be trying to provide financial support to her son for his \ncollege expenses. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (c), and (d) do not fully apply because Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are not yet under control and her delinquent debts are likely to recur. Although \nshe receives full credit for participating in financial counseling, having a budget, and \nentering into a debt consolidation program, these measures are insufficient because her \nplans only address about $10,000 in delinquent SOR debt. About $28,000 in delinquent \ndebt is not addressed.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is attempting to correct her \nfinancial situation by contacting her creditors and participating in a debt consolidation \nprogram. She successfully challenged and reduced her three tax liens debt to $6,129. \nShe has been successful working for defense contractors and the government from \nFebruary 2009 to present. There is no evidence she has ever compromised classified \ninformation or committed any security violations. Applicant expressed remorse for her \nfinancial mistakes and promised to repay her creditors. She established circumstances \nbeyond her control contributed to her inability to pay her debts. These factors show \nsome responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude Applicant presented insufficient evidence of having a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. She presented documentary evidence of recent \nefforts to pay her financial obligations or to resolve her debts; however, there are not \nclear indications that her financial problem is being resolved or is under control. Her \ninability to pay even relatively small debts shows she is financially overextended. Her \n2006 purchase of a large, expensive vehicle shows lack of judgment. She does not \nhave the financial means to resolve her financial problems without substantially \nreducing her expenses.  \n \n \nApplicant is committed to providing financial support to her son for his college \neducation. This additional expense makes it unlikely she will be able to pay the $28,000 \nin debt that is not included in her payment plan. Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is \ninsufficient to mitigate the security concerns arising under the financial considerations \nguideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l, \n \n \n \n \n   and 1.n and 1.o:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked for a year and a half as a recruiter. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the truth of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, with explanations, and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.i, and 2.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact. Applicant is married with three children, ages 24, 16, and 4. He held a security clearance for most of his 25-year enlisted career in the Army, which ended in 2002. He retired as a first sergeant (E-8), and earned five Meritorious Service Medals, three Army Commendation Medals, three Army Achievement Medals, and eight Army Good Conduct Medals during his career.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owes more than $27,600 in seven delinquent debts, including more\nthan $13,000 on his first mortgage loan. He began addressing some of the smaller\ndebts right before and after his hearing, but has not yet established a track record of\nfinancial responsibility or solvency. He did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\napplication. Based upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on April 7, 2008. On May\n12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant\nOctober 23, 2009\n\n2\nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 21, 2009. He answered the SOR in writing\n(AR) on May 28, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 19, 2009, and DOHA assigned\nthe case to me on the same day.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 23, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on July 7, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 8, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H, which were also admitted without\nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until July 21, 2009, for\nsubmission of additional evidence. On that date, Department Counsel forwarded 18\nadditional documents that were submitted by Applicant with no objection to their\nadmissibility. This evidence was marked AE I, and admitted. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked\nfor a year and a half as a recruiter. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the truth of\nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, with explanations, and denied the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.i, and 2.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is married with three children, ages 24, 16, and 4. He held a security\nclearance for most of his 25-year enlisted career in the Army, which ended in 2002. He\nretired as a first sergeant (E-8), and earned five Meritorious Service Medals, three Army\nCommendation Medals, three Army Achievement Medals, and eight Army Good\nConduct Medals during his career. (GE 1 at 15, 18-19; AE I doc 4; Tr. at 57-58.)\nUntil recent marital problems arose, his wife handled the family finances and was\nresponsible for paying their bills. He earned more than $100,000 per year with a\ndifferent defense contractor until about September 2007, when that company lost its\ncontract. Since then, his income (exclusive of retirement pay) has been around $45,000\nper year. His wife formerly earned about $35,000 per year, but left her job and currently\nreceives $1,200 per month in unemployment compensation. (Tr. at 40, 44, 58-60, 63,\n67-72.) \nThe delinquent government credit card account described in SOR \u00b6 1.a has a\n$6,500 limit, and the balance has been consistently between $6,500 and $7,000 since\nat least April 2008. The account was reported to be as much as five months past due\nduring late 2007, was briefly brought current in early 2008, but has been continuously\ndelinquent since February 2008. Applicant is being garnished $345 per month from his\nretirement pay for this debt. His July 2009 account statement showed a balance of\n$6,405, with the past-due amount of $1,077. (GE 2 through 7; AE I docs 8 and 9; Tr. at\n45-48.)\n\n3\nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are the first and second mortgages on\nApplicant\u2019s home. His wife failed to make a number of payments toward these loans\nwithout Applicant\u2019s knowledge. In April 2008, the loans were two months and four\nmonths delinquent respectively. By April 2009, the first mortgage was seven months\npast due, in the amount of $11,868, and the second mortgage was four months ($2,252)\npast due. Applicant made some payments toward these debts between February and\nJuly 2009. An $810 payment on June 1 brought the second mortgage current except for\nthe June and July 2009 payments. He made another $600 payment on July 1, 2009, so\nthat loan was only one month delinquent at that point. However, his first mortgage fell\nfurther behind to be eight months delinquent in the amount of $13,620. He made a\n$1,900 payment on July 1, 2009, to prevent it from falling further behind. Applicant is\nattempting to renegotiate the terms of his first mortgage because he cannot otherwise\nafford to bring it into a current status. (GE 2; GE 6; GE 7; AE H; AE I docs 15, 16, 17;\nAR at 1; Tr. at 40-44, 48-51.)\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was a $195 medical bill that became delinquent in\nMarch 2005, and was placed for collection in December 2007. Applicant settled this\ndebt with the creditor on July 2, 2009, by making a payment of $222.75. However, the\npayment of this check brought his checking account to a negative $1,195 balance.\nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s account statement reflects six ATM cash withdrawals between\nJuly 3 and July 6, 2009. These withdrawals, four of which were at a local casino, totaled\n$980 and incurred an additional $133 in overdraft and transaction fees. (AE F; AE G;\nAE I doc 6; Tr. at 38-39, 51-52.)\nThe SOR \u00b6 1.e debt is another medical bill that became delinquent in May 2006,\nwhich Applicant attributes to services received by his adult daughter. He finally\nacknowledged that he should pay it, however. He agreed with the collection agency to\nsettle the debt for $293.37 on June 30, 2009, but did not make that payment. (AR at 1;\nGE 7 at 2; AE E; AE I doc 7; Tr. at 52-53.)\n The $1,617 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f was for dental services Applicant received\nafter being told it would be covered by his insurance. It was not covered, and the debt\nbecame delinquent in March 2007. In his response to the SOR, he said he had made\narrangements to take care of the debt, without further elaboration. During the hearing,\nhe said he was disputing the debt, and had a court date to resolve the dispute on July 9,\n2009. His post-hearing evidence submission included a July 10, 2009, letter from the\ncollection agency referencing a judgment number and setting forth a total judgment debt\nof $1,886.29. The letter detailed an agreed payment plan requiring Applicant to pay\n$170 per month for 12 months beginning August 1, 2009. (GE 7 at 1; AR at 1; AE I doc\n5; Tr. at 53-54.)\nThe $2,433 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g involves a charged off credit card account.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant said he had never had an account with this\ncreditor, and was disputing the listing with the three credit bureaus. Page 1 of AE A\nreflects a response from one credit bureau that his dispute of a debt to this creditor with\nan unknown account number could not be located. Page 2 of AE A and AE D (as well\n\n4\nas GE 2 at 16 and GE 3 at 2) reflect that Applicant resolved a different delinquent\naccount with this creditor by payments through a financial counseling program. That\naccount had been opened in 1998 and was paid and closed in October 2002. The SOR\n\u00b6 1.g account was opened in November 2003, and became delinquent in August 2007.\n(GE 2 at 20, GE 3 at 2.) Applicant provided no evidence of any action to address or\nresolve this newer charged-off account. \nApplicant successfully challenged the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and it has been\nremoved from his credit reports. (GE 7; AE I docs 11, 12, 13; Tr. at 54.) Although his\nSOR response claimed the \u00b6 1.i debt, in the amount of $2,413, was a case of identity\nfraud, he admitted during the hearing that it was a legitimate obligation incurred by his\nwife in his name. He disputed it with the credit bureaus at the same time as the disputes\ndiscussed above, but the debt was confirmed to have been delinquent since December\n2004. He has made some informal arrangements with his wife and mother-in-law\nconcerning repayment of this debt, but has not made any contact with the creditor to\nresolve it. (GE 7 at 3; AE C; Tr. at 41, 55.)\nOne week after his hearing, Applicant joined a credit counseling service. They\nprepared a budget for him reflecting regular monthly income of $7,063 and expenses of\n$6,815, leaving a surplus of $248. He agreed to pay the service $240 per month into a\ndebt management plan (DMP) starting July 20, 2009, and to make 25 monthly\npayments ending in August 2011. The DMP only includes payments toward the\ndelinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i, and makes no provision for\nrepayment of his mortgage delinquencies, the \u00b6 1.g credit card debt, or more than the\ngarnishment toward the \u00b6 1.a debt. (AE I doc 18.)\nApplicant testified, and his wife corroborated, that he was unaware of their\ndelinquent debts when he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 28a and 28b on his security\nclearance application. He did not learn about these debts until January 2009, when she\ntemporarily left him. (AR at 2; AE H; Tr. at 36-38, 40-44, 58.) He served as a recruiter\nfor many years, and is fully aware of the obligation to truthfully disclose financial matters\non the application. In that regard, he added an \u201cadditional comment\u201d on the final page of\nhis application that said, \u201cI have been late on bills before several times in my life.\u201d (GE 1\nat 31.) Applicant\u2019s demeanor while denying the alleged falsification of financial\ninformation was sincere and forthright. \nApplicant submitted letters from three coworkers attesting to his trustworthiness,\ncompetence, and communication skills. They each described him as a valuable asset to\nthe military and highly recommended that he be granted a security clearance. (AE I at 1\nthrough 3.) He is well educated, mature, and performs his job with excellence.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider and apply the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\n\n5\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded in mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides, \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n6\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel asserted the applicability of two of these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d (Tr. at 19.) Over the past five years, Applicant has\naccumulated multiple delinquent debts that totaled approximately $27,600 at the time of\nhis hearing. He successfully disputed one relatively minor SOR-listed debt, and paid a\nsecond one, albeit by overdrawing his checking account. However, his financial inability\nor unwillingness to pay seven substantial remaining delinquencies supports ongoing\nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a). He is under continuing financial duress, so remains\nat risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The evidence further\nestablished a five-year history of not meeting some significant financial obligations,\nraising security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(c). This history potentially indicates poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, and unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, thereby\nraising questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from\nfinancial considerations. The potentially applicable mitigating conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n\n7\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (b) were not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquencies\nresulted from continuing to spend more than he was earning after a job change resulted\nin reduced family income. Substantial delinquencies continue to date, with no\ndemonstrated means available to resolve them. The fact that he was unaware of the\nspecifics of some delinquencies directly caused by his wife\u2019s failure to pay some bills\nneither restores confidence in his good judgment nor establishes that he acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances. His payment of the $195 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\n1.d was made by overdrawing his checking account. Applicant received some financial\ncounseling a week after his hearing, but the resulting debt management plan addresses\nless than half of his delinquent debt and no actual payment under the plan was proven.\nWhile these are steps in the right direction, meaningful mitigation is not yet established\nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or (d). \nFinally, Applicant successfully disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. However,\nthe evidence he provided concerning SOR \u00b6 1.g involved an earlier debt to the same\ncreditor and did not substantiate a legitimate basis for dispute. He was also in the\nprocess of disputing the legitimacy of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f on his hearing date,\nbut AE I doc 5 showed that this dispute resulted in a judgment against him. AG \u00b6 20(e)\nthus provides mitigation of only the $424 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to\nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, and cooperation with\nmedical or psychological evaluation; \n\n8\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful\nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The potentially disqualifying condition alleged in this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant denied that he deliberately or knowingly omitted, concealed or falsified\nrelevant financial information on his security clearance information when he incorrectly\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to questions 28a and 28b. He proved by a preponderance of the\nevidence that he did not know about these debts at the time, and further established his\ngood-faith effort to be forthcoming by adding a comment that he had encountered\nfinancial delinquencies in the past. The record does not support application of AG \u00b6\n16(a), nor does it raise any personal conduct security concerns independent of those\nthat overlap duplicate reliability and trustworthiness issues arising under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of\nsecurity concern was incurring eight delinquent debts which totaled $27,942 when the\n\n9\nSOR was issued. By the time of his hearing, one $195 debt had been paid by\noverdrawing his checking account, and the remaining seven delinquent debts still\ntotaled more than $27,600. While he was unaware of the delinquent debts when he\ncompleted his security clearance application in April 2008, he became aware of the\nproblems in January 2009 but did nothing to address or resolve any of them until he\nreceived the SOR. His actions since that time have begun to address the resulting\nsecurity concerns, but he has not yet established a good-faith track record of financial\nresponsibility or permanent behavioral changes. Moreover, the record demonstrates his\nongoing inability to address the majority of his delinquent debt, including the first\nmortgage on his home that is now eight months and more than $13,000 delinquent. The\nresulting threat to his family home exacerbates the potential for pressure, coercion, and\nduress over that normally arising from unsecured consumer debts of an equivalent\namount. Applicant exhibited an incomplete understanding of his financial situation and\nfailed to demonstrate that his financial problems are unlikely to continue or worsen.\nApplicant has a long record of excellent and honorable service to the national\ndefense, and is highly regarded by those with whom he serves. On balance, however,\nhe presented insufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns arising from his history\nof failing to meet financial obligations, and his inability or unwillingness to pay his\nsubstantial delinquent debts. The record generates significant doubt as to his present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant rebutted personal conduct\nsecurity concerns, but did not mitigate security concerns related to his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) as part of his employment with a defense contractor on July 8, 2008. After an \ninvestigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nJuly 10, 2009, to Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 31, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 5, 2009, denying all nine allegations \nunder Guideline F. He provided a detailed explanation for his denials, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non November 2, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on November 17, 2009. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on November 20, 2009, scheduling a hearing for December \n8, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered six exhibits, \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 18, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nmarked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6 which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant and three witnesses testified on his behalf. Applicant offered 15 \nexhibits marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through O which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 24, 2009. I \nkept the record open for Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely filed \nfive additional documents marked App. Ex. P through T, which were received without \nobjection (Gov. Ex. 7, memorandum, dated December 31, 2009). Based on a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant received the Notice of Hearing on December 8, 2009, the day of the \nhearing. Applicant is entitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.8). Applicant discussed with Department Counsel the hearing date of December 8, \n2009, before the Notice of Hearing was mailed so actual notice was given more than 15 \ndays before the hearing. At the hearing, Applicant waived the 15 days notice \nrequirement (Tr. 6-7). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the nine factual allegations in the SOR with explanation. I \nincluded Applicant's explanation in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \npleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 48 years old, and has worked as a business developer for a defense \ncontractor since July 2008. He is a college graduate, and served over ten years on \nactive duty in the Navy as a helicopter pilot. He received an honorable discharge. He is \nmarried with three children (Tr. 60-61; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated July 8, 2008). \nApplicant's monthly pay is approximately $6,440. His wife's monthly income is \napproximately $2,200, for a combined monthly total income of $8,640. Their combined \nmonthly expenses are approximately $6,400 leaving over $2,200 in monthly disposable \nincome (Tr. 68-72; Gov. Ex. 3, Answers to Interrogatories, date June 8, 2009 at 72). His \nmortgage has been modified and his payments are on schedule (App. E, Cancelled \nchecks, October, November, December 2009; App. Ex. S, Forbearance agreement, \ndated August 25, 2009). He paid other debts that were questioned during the \ninvestigative phase but not included in the SOR (App. Ex. F, Bank transactions, dated \nApril 29, 2009). Applicant provided a current status of his delinquent debts (App. Ex. K, \nDebts, undated). \n \nApplicant worked at various businesses doing business development after \nleaving the Navy. He also assisted in managing a family insurance business. His \nincome fluctuated from 2006 to 2008, from $22,129 in 2006, to $71,917 in 2007, and \n$45,495 in 2008, depending on the business he was able to develop (App. Ex. A, \nIncome tax return for tax years 2006, 2007, 2008). He used investment accounts in \nearly 2006 to support himself and his family while developing business opportunities \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(App. Ex. B, Investment snapshoot, dated January 31, 2006). He received limited credit \nand financial counseling during this time (App. Ex. C, Counseling application, undated). \nHis latest credit report shows that his current debts are paid as agreed (App. Ex. L, \nCredit report, dated December 3, 2009). \n \nOne of Applicant's business enterprises was developing a concept for a potential \ngovernment contract (App. Ex. D, Contract, dated March 1, 2008). The work required \nApplicant to move to another state where he rented a small apartment. His family \nremained in their home area, and Applicant commuted weekly from his home to where \nhe was working. Applicant stayed in this position for about six months, but the \ngovernment was not able to award the contract. Applicant left the apartment before the \nend of the lease and moved back to his home area. Applicant states that when he left \nthe apartment was clean and in excellent condition. Applicant did not receive the pay he \nwas promised for his work (Tr. 18-44).  \n \nSome of Applicant's business ventures were only marginally successful (App. Ex. \nN, Letter, dated April 8, 2003). Other business ventures were unsuccessful. He \nterminated one venture because he did not trust his business partner and considered \nhis actions unscrupulous (App. Ex. M, Letter, dated October 19, 2004). Another venture \nhe terminated because he considered his employer to be dishonest, selfish, and greedy. \nAgain, Applicant was not paid what he was promised by his potential employers (App. \nEx. O, Letter, dated November 12, 2002). \n \nCredit reports ( Gov. Ex. 4, Credit report, dated December 4, 2009; Gov. Ex. 5, \nCredit report, dated December 9, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 6, Credit report, dated August 5, \n2008) show the following delinquent debts for Applicant: a judgment in favor of an \napartment landlord for $179 (SOR 1.a); a cable company debt in collection for $1,695 \n(SOR 1.b); another debt for the same apartment complex listed in SOR 1.a in collection \nfor $240 (SOR 1.c); a credit card debt in collection for $812 (SOR 1.d); four debts owed \nto the same time share company in collection for $1,954 (SOR 1.e), $2,409 (SOR 1.f), \n$1,868 (SOR 1.g), and $1,651 (SOR 1.h); and property rental past due for $640 (SOR \n1.i) The balance owed on these accounts is $10,800 (Tr. 11-12). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.a and SOR 1.c are the same debt for a cleaning \nfee incurred when Applicant moved out of the apartment he rented while working on a \npotential government contract. Applicant contested the charge since he only occupied \nthe apartment about four nights a week and left it in good condition. The landlord sought \na judgment against Applicant (Gov. Ex. 2, Judgment, dated April 14, 2008). Even \nthough he protested the bill, Applicant paid the debt in full (Tr. 28-32; App. Ex. H, Bill \nand bank check, dated June 8, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.b is a debt to a cable company. Half of the debt is \nfor equipment and the other half is for the monthly rental. Applicant returned the \nequipment and paid the monthly charges (Tr. 32-37; Answer to SOR, dated August 5, \n2009, at 9 and 10; App. Ex. G, Bank statement, dated August 19, 2009). The debt is \npaid in full (App. Ex. R, Statement, dated December 17, 2009).  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.d is a credit card debt. The credit card was used \nby Applicant and his wife when he was living in an apartment away from his family. \nApplicant is paying this debt under a payment plan. He made two payments, and has \ntwo more payments of approximately $200 each to resolve the debt (Tr. 37-39; App, Ex. \nI, Bank statement, dated August 6, 2009, and cancelled check, dated August 14, 2009).  \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h are various charges from a \ntime share Applicant and his wife invested in starting in 2005. At the time, he did not \nknow that there were various lawsuits against the time share management company. \nHe received letters from other time share owners commenting on the various problems \nwith the time share. In addition to the annual fees, Applicant started to receive \nmaintenance and other home owner assessments that he was unaware he was \nresponsible for. These fees are the subject of ongoing litigation against the time share \nmanagement company. Applicant and his wife never used the time share, and tried to \nsell it, but were not successful. The time share initially cost $500. The debts are for \nmaintenance fees, delinquency charges, and late charges, and total over $8,000 (App. \nEx. J, Letter, dated August 14, 2009). Applicant was told by the president of the time \nshare company that he could settle his debt for $8,000. Applicant is disputing this debt \nbut acknowledges he does own some amount on the time share. He sends the \ncompany $250 per month and plans to continue sending the company the monthly \npayments until he has paid what he believes is the amount of the debt that he owes (Tr. \n41-45; App. Ex. P, Applicant's letter, dated December 31, 2009; App. Ex. T, Cancelled \ncheck, dated December 21, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.i is for rent of a storage space for a camper and a \nboat. Applicant paid the debt in full (Tr. 45-46; App. Ex. Q, paid in full letter, dated \nDecember 16, 2009). \n \nA government employee testified that he held a security clearance for over 25 \nyears. He has known Applicant for over three years. He was aware of Applicant's \nbusiness and professional experience, so in 2007, he convinced Applicant's employer to \nassign him to support the witness's government staff. He saw Applicant on a daily basis \nuntil his clearance was suspended. He now sees him on a weekly basis. Applicant's \nwork performance has exceeded the witness's expectations because of Applicant's \nexperience and skill (Tr. 76-81). \n \nAnother government employee testified that he has held a security clearance for \nover 40 years. He has known Applicant for over two years, and has seen and interacted \nwith him on a daily basis for over a year. He considers Applicant in the top 2% of people \nhe works with as to knowledge, competency, and capability. Applicant is absolutely \nessential to his group in the entire process of their work for the government. He stated \nApplicant is extremely trustworthy, diligent, and capable of handling classified \ndocuments. He considers Applicant to be reliable with impeccable judgment (Tr. 75-92),  \n \nApplicant's supervisor, a former government employee who held a security \nclearance for over 30 years, testified that he hired Applicant in August 2008. He sees \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand works with Applicant on a daily basis. He stated Applicant has good character and \nis a capable, creative, and diligent employee. He finds Applicant to be trustworthy, \nreliable, very smart, very competent, trustworthy, and exercises good judgment (Tr. 92-\n97). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts are a security concern raising Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts while developing employment opportunities, \nchanging jobs, and to look for better employment.  \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). The mitigating conditions apply. Applicant's delinquent debts \noccurred as he sought business and employment opportunities. These business \nventures were unsuccessful through no fault of Applicant. He also did not receive the \npay he was promised. These circumstances were beyond his control. The failed \nbusiness opportunities and lack of sufficient pay caused him to be unable to keep his \ndebts current. Now that he is steadily employed and highly regarded by his employer, \nthe circumstances of his negative job search should not recur and he should not again \nincur delinquent debts. His present credit report shows he is paying his debts as \nagreed. He acted responsibly under the circumstances by paying most of his past due \ndebts and staying current with his present financial obligations. Since his debts have \nbeen or are being paid, his finances do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded. Applicant has sufficient discretionary funds to pay his delinquent debts. He \npresented sufficient information to show that four of the nine delinquent debts have \nbeen paid in full. One debt is being paid under a payment plan and Applicant has only \ntwo small payments remaining. The other four debts are to the same creditor for fees on \na time share. Applicant is contesting the fees. He acknowledges that he does owe some \ndebt to the creditor and he started paying the creditor $250 per month pending a \nresolution of the dispute. Applicant's action in contacting his creditors and arranging to \nmake payments on the debts demonstrates a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute \nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumentation to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue). Applicant disputes the time share fees. He presented \ninformation to establish the fees charged are an ongoing issue with the time share \nowners. While the dispute has not been resolved, Applicant has a reasonable basis for \nhis dispute and is making payments on the debt in anticipation of the dispute being \nresolved.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant is a \nhighly regarded employee and is considered by his friends, supervisors, and employers \nto be trustworthy, reliable, honest, competent, capable, and exercises good judgment.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. He is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that he paid each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is \nrequired is that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems and takes significant \naction to implement that plan. The entirety of his financial situation and his actions can \nreasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which his actions to reduce his \noutstanding indebtedness are credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about \nthe person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and \nconcomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time.   \n \nApplicant established a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. Applicant presented \nsufficient information to show he is taking reasonable and responsible action to resolve \nhis financial issues. He paid four of the nine delinquent debts, and has two small \npayments remaining on a fifth debt. He has a reasonable basis for his dispute of four \ntime share debts. Applicant is making some payments on the timeshare amount he \nconsiders appropriate. Applicant's management of his finances and payment of past \nobligations indicates he will be concerned, responsible, and careful regarding classified \ninformation. Applicant mitigated security concerns based on his finances. \n \nOverall, on balance the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant mitigated security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On February 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 5), pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 6). On April 14, \n2009, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On April 16, 2009, DOHA \nassigned the case to me. On April 17, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 6). At \nthe hearing held on May 21, 2009, Department Counsel offered three exhibits (GE 1-3) \n(Transcript (Tr.) 18-19), and Applicant offered 12 exhibits (Tr. 20-24; AE A-L). \nDepartment Counsel did not object to my consideration of AE A-L, and I admitted them \n(Tr. 23-24). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, response to the SOR, \nand an e-mail keeping the record open until July 10, 2009, to permit Applicant to submit \nadditional evidence (GE 4-7). I received the transcript on May 29, 2009. On May 27, \n2009, I received nine post-hearing exhibits, and on July 9, 2009, I received 24 post-\nhearing exhibits.

She expects to earn her bachelor\u2019s degree in management/computer systems in \na year (Tr. 7).      \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR did not describe any bankruptcy filings. However, it listed 13 \ndelinquent debts, which are fully discussed in the next 13 paragraphs. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($1,000 owed to her child\u2019s private school)\u2014Payment Plan. \nApplicant\u2019s husband was supposed to pay this debt (Tr. 27). It became delinquent \nbetween January 2008 and May 7, 2009 (Tr. 28). The creditor did not inform her the \naccount was delinquent for quite a long time because she was friends with the school\u2019s \nmanagement (Tr. 27-29). She set up a payment arrangement and paid: $50 on June 6, \n2009; $680 on June 26, 2009; and $50 on July 1, 2009 (Tr. 29; AE A; AE E; AE F; AE \nW at 1).  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c ($42 and $44 owed to a pizza company)\u2014Paid. In 2002 \nusing Applicant\u2019s account, her husband wrote checks that were dishonored (Tr. 29-30). \nAt the time she responded to the SOR, she was unaware of these two debts (Tr. 31). \nOn April 20, 2009, she paid $175 resolving the debt (Tr. 30; AE I).  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($5,500 owed a collection company for a home security system)\u2014\nDispute/Payment Plan. Applicant disputes this debt (Tr. 31). In 2006, a security \ncompany started billing her even though the company never installed the security \nsystem (Tr. 31-33). This was a joint debt with her husband (Tr. 32). On April 30, 2009, \nshe entered into a payment plan with the creditor and made her first payment of $300 \n(Tr. 32; AE K; AE Z). She also made $300 payments on June 2, 2009 and July 1, 2009 \n(AE AA). She hopes to be reimbursed after the dispute filed in May 2009 is resolved (Tr. \n32-33).    \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($370 owed to a collection company)\u2014Disputed. On April 20, 2009, \nApplicant contacted the collection company and learned the debt was transferred to \nanother company (Tr. 35). She thought her husband may have incurred the debt \nbecause she had no knowledge of it (Tr. 35). The collection company promised to take \naction to have the debt removed from her credit report (Tr. 36; AE W at 2).   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,088 owed to a collection company based on a credit card debt)\u2014\nPaid. Prior to 2009, Applicant was not aware of this debt (Tr. 36-37). She had a credit \ncard with this same company and it was current (Tr. 36). She learned the debt was from \na previous, joint credit card issued prior to 2006 (Tr. 37). She paid $25 on April 20, \n2009, $250 payment on May 18, 2009, and the final $250 on June 24, 2009 (Tr. 37-38; \nAE J; AE R; AE U; AE AE; AE AF; AE AG).  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,837 owed to a collection company)\u2014Paid. Prior to 2009, \nApplicant was not aware of this debt (Tr. 39). She thought her husband may have \nwritten the checks that generated this debt (Tr. 40). On April 20, 2009, she asked the \ncollection company for documentation to show she owed this debt (Tr. 39). On June 30, \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n2009, she agreed to settle this debt for $918, and then she paid the settlement amount \n(AE W at 1; AE AO, AP).  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($1,117 owed to a collection company)\u2014Paid. Applicant first learned \nof this debt in 2009 (Tr. 41). On April 30, 2009, she spoke to the creditor and agreed to \nand did pay $335 (Tr. 41; AE L). She also agreed to pay $50 a month starting May 30, \n2009 (Tr. 41-42; AE T; AE L). On June 24, 2009, the creditor indicated the amount \nowed was $698 and offered to settle the debt for $454 (AE AK). On July 1, 2009, she \npaid $454, resolving this debt (AE AN).     \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($395 owed on a cable debt)\u2014Paid. The debt originated in 2005 (Tr. \n43). Applicant was not aware of it until 2009 (Tr. 43). After she received the SOR, she \npaid it (Tr. 43-44; AE B).   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($360 owed to a collection company)\u2014Paid. Applicant\u2019s husband was \nresponsible for this debt (Tr. 45-46). On May 14, 2009, she paid $479 and thought the \ndebt was resolved (Tr. 47). However, the creditor wanted an additional $100 (Tr. 47-48).  \nOn May 29, 2009, she paid the remaining $100 (AE X).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($744 owed to an insurance company)\u2014Payment Plan. This is an old \nautomobile insurance debt (Tr. 48-49). Applicant paid $62 on May 11, 2009 (Tr. 49; AE \nC; AE W at 1; AE S). On July 1, 2009, she paid $196 (AE W at 1; AE AI, AE AJ). She \nexpects this debt to be paid in full in October 2009 (AE W at 1). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($3,818 owed to a collection company for a credit card)\u2014Payment \nPlan. Applicant was making minimal payments on this account (Tr. 50, 52). Although \nthis credit card was in Applicant\u2019s name alone, she and her husband both used this \ncredit card to purchase items (Tr. 51-52). The account probably became delinquent \nwhen she was going through marital problems and the initial separation (Tr. 51-53). \nHowever, she was surprised to discover the creditor was reporting the account as \ndelinquent because she believed she was paying enough to keep the account current \n(Tr. 50, 52). She obtained a credit report in 2008, and it did not show the account as \ndelinquent (Tr. 50-51). On May 29, 2009, she made a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor and paid $75 on May 29, 2009, and $75 on June 29, 2009 (Tr. 55; AE W at 1; \nAE AB, AE AC; AE AD). The current balance is $4,174 (AE AC). The last three \npayments of $1,000 monthly will be in August, September and October (Tr. 55-56). The \ndebt will be paid off completely in October 2009 (Tr. 55).   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($19,868 owed to a collection company for a repossessed BMW)\u2014\nPayment Plan. Applicant obtained a credit report in 2008, and it did not show the \nrepossession of the BMW (Tr. 51). The vehicle debt was her husband\u2019s responsibility \n(Tr. 51). She was making the $1,000 monthly payments from 2005 to May 2007 (Tr. 58-\n59). She gave the car to her husband in May 2007 because she could not afford the \n$1,000 monthly payments (Tr. 51, 56-57). The BMW was her husband\u2019s car (Tr. 51). It \nwas in his possession when it was repossessed in either October 2007 or June 2008, \ndepending on the credit report entry (Tr. 56-57, 59-60). She was not aware of the \nrepossession until 2009 (Tr. 58). She recognized that because she co-signed on the car \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nlien, she was jointly responsible for paying the debt (Tr. 51, 57-58, 84). She did not \nmake payment arrangements until July 2009 because she hoped her husband would \ntake responsibility for this debt (Tr. 62). On July 1, 2009, she made a $552 payment and \nestablished her payment plan on a debt totaling $19,868 (AE W at 2; AE AQ; AE R; AE \nS).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from her separation from her husband \nand his failure to pay adequate support (Tr. 66). At first, he was not paying any support \n(Tr. 66). She had to pay high levels of rent, car payments and other bills (Tr. 72). Her \nemployer reduced her weekly work hours from 40 to 32 (Tr. 72). After a tough period of \ntime financially, she gradually made progress (Tr. 73). Her work hours subsequently \nincreased to 42, and her husband paid more child support (Tr. 73-74). On May 21, \n2009, her husband provided a statement accepting responsibility for most of the \ndelinquent SOR debts and promising to pay them (AE Q). Her husband wants to \nsalvage their marriage and is paying child support, even though there is no legal \nseparation agreement (Tr. 74). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual net salary is about $80,000 (Tr. 62-63). Additionally, she \nreceives $1,500 monthly from her husband as child support (Tr. 63).  Monthly expenses \ninclude: rent ($1,850); groceries ($300); clothing ($50); cable, phone and internet \n($130); daughter\u2019s school ($792); son\u2019s daycare ($348); car payment ($678); car \ninsurance ($220), gas ($350), and her new payment arrangements with the various \nSOR creditors (Tr. 66). She has a monthly remainder of about $3,400 (Tr. 66, 68-69). \nShe has about $3,000 in savings (Tr. 67). She recently opened three small credit-card \naccounts in order to build a positive credit history (Tr. 67-68).  \n \nFalsification of Security Clearance Application \n \nApplicant signed her SF-86 on May 29, 2008. In regard to her delinquent debts \nand repossessed vehicles, her SF-86 asked three questions. Applicant incorrectly \nresponded, \u201cNo\u201d to questions 27b, 28a and 28b (GE 1), which asked: \n \nSection 27: Your Financial Record \n \nAnswer the following questions. \n \nb. In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any \nproperty repossessed for any reason? \n \nSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies \n \nAnswer the following questions. \n \na. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)? \n \nb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 contains the following admonition: \n \nCertification That My Answers Are True \n \nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good \nfaith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form \ncan be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title \n18, United States Code). \n \n(emphasis in original) (GE 1 at 1). Immediately below this admonition appears her \nsignature (GE 1 at 1). Applicant does not contest that she signed and certified this SF-\n86.2   \n \nAround the time Applicant\u2019s husband moved out of their apartment in the summer \nof 2006, Applicant and her spouse each had a list of accounts they were supposed to \nkeep current (Tr. 53). There was no written separation agreement. She paid her share \nof their debts as agreed (Tr. 53). She obtained an Equifax credit report in January 2008 \nbefore she completed her SF-86 (Tr. 51, 71). Her report did not show any delinquent \naccounts or the vehicle repossession (Tr. 51, 71). She assumed when the accounts did \nnot appear on her 2008 credit report as delinquent that her husband was keeping his \npromise about paying those debts (Tr. 53-54). She did not keep a copy of the 2008 \nEquifax credit report that she relied upon; however, she noted the government\u2019s current \nreport did not show delinquencies on the Equifax credit report prior to May of 2008 (Tr. \n53-54). The other credit reporting companies were the sources of the allegations about \ndelinquent debts (Tr. 53). She was completely unaware of any delinquent debts when \nshe completed her SF-86 (Tr. 60).  \n \nWhen an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed \nApplicant, she denied responsibility for the SOR debts because she was unaware of her \nculpability for those debts (Tr. 70). The OPM investigator did not give her copies of the \ncredit report supporting the alleged debts (Tr. 70). \n   \nApplicant denied that she knowingly failed to disclose information on her SF-86 \nabout delinquent debts and repossession of a BMW (Tr. 72). She promised to honor her \npayment plans (AE O at 3). She emphasized she is \u201can honest, trustworthy person, with \nintegrity and [she] would do whatever it takes to safeguard any classified information \nthat [she] is in contact with\u201d (AE O at 3). \n \n \n \n \n \n2The only derogatory information disclosed on her SF-86 was a single entry, indicating in March \n2007 she was charged with misdemeanor Theft by Check (GE 1 at Section 23). The theft charge was \ndismissed (GE 1 at Section 23). \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are \nof security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in her \nSOR response and her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure her creditors \nwere paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired. \n  \n   \nFive conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may mitigate security concerns and are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because she \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts. Her \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). She receives partial credit because her \ndelinquent debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d I \nam convinced that she will continue with her payment plans and resolve all of her SOR \ndebts. Her SOR debts do not \u201ccast doubt on [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because her financial problems \ninitially resulted because of separation from her spouse in 2006 and some \nunderemployment as her hours were reduced.3 She does not receive full mitigating \ncredit because she had sufficient information about her spouse\u2019s irresponsibility to know \nshe should have stayed in touch with creditors on joint accounts. Moreover, she did not \nestablish that she acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to address her delinquent \ndebts after she learned of their existence. Essentially, she waited until April 2009 to \naggressively address her delinquent debts.    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant did not receive financial counseling. \nHowever, there are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol.\u201d She has also established partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because she \nshowed some, recent good faith4 in the resolution of her SOR debts. \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \n Applicant contested the validity of two debts. She established one debt was \ntransferred (SOR \u00b6 1.e for $370). She has made three $300 payments (April, May and \nJune 2009) on the other debt even though there is some question about whether it is \nvalid (SOR \u00b6 1.d for $5,500). I will fully apply AG \u00b6 20(e) to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and partially \napply it to 1.d.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her SOR lists 13 debts totaling about $36,000. \nShe paid seven debts, totaling about $4,800 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c and 1.f-1.j). She \nsuccessfully disputed a debt for $370 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The five remaining debts are in \nestablished payment plans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d and 1.k-1.m). She paid about $2,500 in the \nApril to July 2009 period to establish these five payment plans. In the last four months, \nher efforts have been sufficient to mitigate her SOR debts. She promised to continue to \ncomply with her payment plans until all of her SOR debts are resolved. I am confident \nshe will keep her promise5 because of her substantial recent progress on SOR debt \nresolution.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n5 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context \nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and \nestablishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of \ndocumentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is \nconditional. \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security \nclearance application: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nOn May 29, 2008, Applicant signed her SF-86, in which she failed to disclose her \nvehicle repossession and several delinquent debts. In her SOR response and at her \nhearing, she admitted that she failed to disclose required financial information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(a) and 16(b) both apply and further review is necessary. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nApplicant disclosed on her SF-86 a Theft by Check charge, which the court \nsubsequently dismissed. Her disclosure of derogatory information on her SF-86 \nconcerning a dismissed charge of Theft by Check is an indication she was not trying to \nhide adverse information. She said she checked her Equifax credit report in January \n2008, and there were no delinquent accounts noted. Applicant and her spouse \nseparated in July 2006, and he was supposed to take care of the accounts listed on the \nSOR as delinquent. She credibly stated she was not aware of the vehicle repossession \nand delinquent SOR accounts when she completed her SF-86. I conclude Applicant\u2019s \nalleged falsification of her SF-86 is mitigated. Although she provided false information \non her security clearance application, AG \u00b6 17(f) applies to Applicant\u2019s failure to \ndisclose financial information. The falsification allegations are not substantiated. I am \nsatisfied she did not deliberately and intentionally fail to disclose her delinquent debts \nand repossessed vehicle with intent to deceive.6 I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in the Findings \nsection of this decision with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n6The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct. When \nshe became separated from her husband, she should have been more aggressive in \nher efforts to ensure her husband paid their joint debts as he agreed. In February 2009, \nshe received the SOR. She did not actively and aggressively investigate the debts listed \non her SOR until April 2009. These factors show some financial irresponsibility and lack \nof judgment. Her history of delinquent debt and failure to provide accurate information \non her SF-86 raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation(s). She is generally a law-abiding citizen (her only alleged criminal offense is a \ndismissed charge of Theft by Check in 2007). Her current financial problems were \ncaused by some factors partially or fully beyond her control: (1) insufficient income, (2) \nseparation from her spouse and (3) underemployment.  Her SOR lists 13 debts totaling \nabout $36,000. She paid seven debts, totaling about $4,800. She successfully disputed \na debt for $370. The five remaining debts are in established payment plans. She paid \nabout $2,500 in the April to July 2009 period to establish these five payment plans. Her \nother debts, such as her apartment lease and car payments, are current. The Appeal \nBoard has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases \nstating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, \ndemonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. She graduated from \nhigh school, earned an associates degree and has almost completed her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. She served on active duty in the Army for 2 \u00bd years, and received an \nhonorable discharge. Her employment history and contributions to a defense contractor \nspeak well for her character. She understands how to budget and what she needs to do \nto establish her financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated her loyalty, \npatriotism and trustworthiness through her service to the Department of Defense as an \nemployee of a defense contractor.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.m: \nFor Applicant \n \nPARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He was forthcoming and \ncandid during the security clearance process. He received training about ethical \nbehavior and the handling of classified and proprietary information. He expressed \nsincere remorse for his past questionable behavior and understands that it could \nadversely impact on his ability to hold a security clearance. He has matured into a good \nhusband and responsible employee. His questionable behavior is not recent, it is \nunlikely to recur, and it does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. Applicant mitigated security concerns under Guidelines E and M. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 3, 2008. After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \nJanuary 24, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nOn May 18, 2010, DOHA issued Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), which \nspecified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns under Guideline E (Personal \nConduct), and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems) of the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG).2  \n \nOn June 1, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 23, \n2010, to determine whether a clearance should be granted or denied. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on September 16, 2010, and the hearing was convened as scheduled \non October 1, 2010.  \n \nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified, and he presented exhibits (AE) 1 through 9, which were \nadmitted without objection. I left the record open for Applicant to supplement it, and he \ntimely submitted AE 10. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 9, \n2010.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant testified with the assistance of two outstanding interpreters certified by \nthe Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf. \n \n \nOn Government\u2019s motion, and with Applicant\u2019s consent, I amended the SOR to \ninclude Applicant\u2019s middle name (Marc). (Tr. 13) \n \n \nApplicant agreed to his hearing date 15 days in advance of his hearing. At \nhearing, he also waived his right to 15 days advanced notice of his hearing. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, with explanations. He admitted and \ndenied, in part, the factual allegations in the SOR \u00b6 2.a, with explanations. His \nadmissions are incorporated here as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended; and Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the AGs, implemented by the DoD on September 1, \n2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old network security risk assessment and mitigation \nspecialist working for a government contractor since March 2008. He received interim \naccess to classified information at the secret level in May 2008. He seeks his security \nclearance eligibility to retain his position.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2000. Between 2000 and 2007, he \nattended several colleges off-and-on in different states. In 2007, he completed his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in business administration with a concentration in information \ntechnology (IT). He married his wife in July 2008. They have no children. \n \nDuring a July 2008 interview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator, Applicant disclosed that between 2005 and 2008, he frequently attempted \nto and entered private wireless networks without authorization to test his ability to \npenetrate the networks. While in college, he was playing with computers, experimenting \nwith what he was learning, and testing security programs and his own abilities.  \n \nApplicant used commercially available, specialized computer programs to \nmonitor Internet traffic and identify the networks Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or he \nwould enter random IP addresses to attempt to access them. He sought out and gained \naccess to unsecure or weakly secured networks. He testified that even though he was \nable to break into the networks, he never entered, modified, or accessed the systems. \nNor did he share this information with anyone else. He averred he emailed the persons \nor companies about their deficient security systems hoping they would fix it.  \n \nApplicant mistakenly believed his actions were not illegal because he did not \nenter the subjects systems, nor did he access or manipulate any personal information. \nHe claimed he only identified the \u201ckey\u201d to entering the subjects\u2019 computer system and \nproceeded no further. \n \nIn 2007, he entered the secured network of a real estate company in Hong Kong, \nChina. Applicant testified he informed the company of his access to its network and \nadvised them that their security was faulty. He never received any acknowledgment of \nhis emails to companies or people about their networks\u2019 deficiency. He does not recall \nhow many networks he accessed. At some of his friends\u2019 requests, he would also \naccess their networks to identify security deficiencies. Applicant disclosed his \nquestionable behavior to one of his supervisors. \n \nApplicant stopped his questionable behavior when he started working for his \ncurrent employer in 2008. As a result of his job, he received training about IT ethics and \nthe handling of classified and proprietary information. Applicant now understands that \nhis questionable behavior was unethical and illegal. Moreover, he now understands that \nsuch behavior could adversely impact on his ability to hold a security clearance, to keep \nhis current job, or to work in the IT field. \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for his past behavior. He has matured \nduring the last three years. He is now married and holds a full-time position with a large \n\n \n4 \n \n \ngovernment contractor. He is busy at work and at home and he no longer has the time \nto experiment or play with computers. He is dedicated to his wife and his work. He is \nconsidered to be technically proficient, and a valuable employee with good \nperformance. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe President of the United States has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. \nSupreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable to reach his decision.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any expressed or implied determination about Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the Applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe facts and circumstances raising security clearance concerns under \nGuidelines E and M are the same. For the sake of brevity, they will be discussed here \nand incorporated by reference in the discussion of Guideline M.  \n \nBetween 2005 and 2008, Applicant frequently broke into private wireless \nnetworks without authorization to test his ability to penetrate the networks. Although he \nwas able to break into the networks, he never entered, modified, or accessed the \nprivate systems. Nor did he share this information with anyone else. He emailed the \npersons or companies\u2019  network systems he penetrated and informed them of their \ndeficient security systems hoping they would fix it.  \n \nApplicant mistakenly believed his actions were not illegal because he did not \nenter the subjects\u2019 systems. He did not access or manipulate any personal information. \nHe claimed he stopped when he identified the \u201ckey\u201d to entering the subjects\u2019 computer \nsystems. In 2007, he entered the secured network of a real estate company in Hong \nKong, China. His actions trigger the applicability of the following disqualifying conditions: \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information. This \nincludes but is not limited to consideration of: . . .  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could potentially mitigate the personal \nconduct security concerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \n \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed his questionable behavior on his SCA, during his \ninterview with an OPM investigator, and to one of his supervisors. The Government had \nno knowledge of his behavior before his disclosure. Since the start of his current job, he \nhas received yearly training about his IT ethical responsibilities and in the proper \nhandling of proprietary and classified information. In May 2008, he received an interim \nsecret clearance. There is no evidence that he has compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information, or that he has failed to follow his job\u2019s rules and \nregulations.  \n \nMost of Applicant\u2019s unauthorized intrusions into private networks occurred while \nhe was attending college. He accessed the networks to test his ability to penetrate the \nnetworks. He was playing with computers, experimenting with what he was learning in \ncollege and testing security programs and his own abilities. He never entered, modified, \nor accessed the systems after breaking into the private networks security systems. Nor \ndid he share this information with anyone else. He averred he emailed network\u2019s owners \nabout their deficient security system hoping they would fix it. Applicant mistakenly \nbelieved his actions were not illegal because he did not enter the subjects\u2019 systems. He \ndid not access or manipulate any personal information. He only identified the \u201ckey\u201d to \nenter the subjects\u2019 computer systems and stopped there. \n \nApplicant stopped his questionable behavior in 2008, when he started working for \nhis current employer. He completed courses and received training about IT ethics and \nthe handling of classified and proprietary information. He now clearly understands that \nhis past questionable behavior was unethical and illegal. Moreover, he also understands \nthat such behavior could adversely impact on his ability to hold a security clearance. \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for his past behavior. He is now a \nresponsible husband. He is considered to be a good worker and a valuable employee. \nApplicant has matured during the last three years. He is dedicated to his wife and his \nwork. He is considered to be technically proficient, valuable employee. \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \nAG \u00b6 39 articulates the security concern about the misuse of information \ntechnology systems: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \n\n \n8 \n \n \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s questionable behavior, as discussed under Guideline E, also raise \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 40(a): \u201cillegal or unauthorized entry into any information \ntechnology system or component thereof;\u201d and AG \u00b6 40(c): \u201cuse of any information \ntechnology system to gain unauthorized access to another system or to a compartmented \narea within the same system.\u201d \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 41 provides three potentially applicable mitigating conditions to the use of \ninformation technology systems concern:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one's \npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily \navailable; and  \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of \nsupervisor. \n \nFor the same reasons discussed under the Guideline E mitigating conditions, \nincorporated here, I find that AG \u00b6 41(a) applies. The circumstances in his life have \nchanged and the misuse of his computer is not likely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 41(b) and (c) are not \napplicable to Applicant\u2019s behavior because his misuse was not minor and his conduct was \nintentional. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n9 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and M in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(c) were previously addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment.  \nApplicant\u2019s questionable behavior is primarily attributed to his immaturity as a \ncollege student. He voluntarily disclosed his questionable behavior in his 2008 SCA and \nwas forthcoming and candid during the security clearance process and at his hearing. \nHe stopped his questionable behavior in 2008, when he started working for his current \nemployer. He received yearly training about ethical behavior and the handling of \nclassified and proprietary information. He understands that his past questionable \nbehavior was unethical and illegal. Moreover, he clearly understands that such behavior \ncould adversely impact on his ability to hold a security clearance. \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for his past behavior. He is now a \nresponsible husband. He has held his full-time job since March 2008, and he is \nconsidered to be a good worker and a valuable employee. Applicant has matured during \nthe last three years. On balance, I find that Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior is not \nrecent, it is unlikely to recur, and it does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Accordingly, her \nrequest for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on December 20, 2007 and May 19, 2008. After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nFebruary 4, 2010\n\n \n \n2 \n                                                \nOn July 7, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that \nspecified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive under \nGuidelines B (Foreign Influence) and E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG).2 \n \nApplicant signed her notarized Answer on August 5, 2009, in which she denied \nthree allegations under Guideline B, and two allegations under Guideline E. Applicant \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on August 27, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on the following day. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 7, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on November 4, 2009. The government offered three exhibits, which were \nadmitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant testified \non her own behalf and presented one witness. She also offered two exhibits, which \nwere admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. I held the record \nopen to allow the government to offer an additional exhibit. Department Counsel timely \nsubmitted one document, which she forwarded to Applicant on November 5, 2009. It \nwas received into evidence without objection as GE 4. DOHA received the transcript on \nNovember 10, 2009. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nThe government requested I take administrative notice of certain country-related \nfacts. Department Counsel submitted a summary of facts and supporting documentation \nrelated to Iraq (Hearing Exhibit 1), Saudi Arabia (Hearing Exhibit 2), and the United \nArab Emirates (UAE) (Hearing Exhibit 3). The documents are included to provide \nelaboration and context for the summary. The facts administratively noticed are limited \nto matters of general knowledge not subject to reasonable dispute, and included in the \nsubmitted government reports.

After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, \nand the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 26 years old. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in environmental \nscience and business administration. She is a civil affairs consultant for a federal \ncontractor, working on course management. She applied for her first security clearance \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n3 \nin 2007. She was denied an interim security clearance, but received a final secret \nclearance in April 2008. Applicant is not married and has no children (GE 1, 3). \n \nApplicant was born in the United States after her parents emigrated from Iraq in \nthe 1970s. She has no foreign property, and no financial interests in Iraq. She does not \nreceive financial support from her father, who lives in Saudi Arabia. She is not in touch \nwith any family members who live in Iraq. She has traveled extensively, including the \nUAE in 2000; Spain in 2001; the UAE in 2002; the Netherlands in March and October \n2003, April 2004, and January-May 2005; Turkey and Jordan in 2003; Morocco, Egypt, \nSpain, and Italy in 2005; Dominica (educational purposes), Ghana, Canada, England, \nand China in 2006; Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel in 2008; and Brazil in 2009. \nApplicant's numerous trips to the Netherlands involved sightseeing, visiting her \nboyfriend at the time, and completing a study-abroad program (GE 3; Tr. 113-117). \n \n \nApplicant's father is a citizen of Iraq, who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \n1989 (GE 1). He is a doctor, and is currently employed as section head of general \nsurgery at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The hospital is operated by the Saudi Arabian \nMinistry of Health (GE 3; Tr. 44-45, 49). He worked in Saudi Arabia for one- to two-\nmonth periods in 2007, and then moved there permanently in early 2008. He is aware \nthat Applicant holds a security clearance (Tr. 52). Currently, Applicant's parents are in \nthe process of divorcing because of her father\u2019s infidelities over a period of years. \nPreviously, Applicant had a good relationship and frequent communication with him (Tr. \n44-45, 48). Since learning of the affairs, however, Applicant ended their relationship. \nThey have had no communication since fall 2008 (GE 3; Tr. 45-47). \n \nApplicant's mother, an Iraqi citizen, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1989 \n(GE 1). She is a doctor, currently working in a hospital in the United States (Tr. 58). In \n2007 and 2008, she traveled to Saudi Arabia two to three times to work in the same \nhospital as her husband for one-month periods, later returning to the United States. Her \nmost recent trip occurred in 2008. Applicant testified that, based on their conversations, \nher mother has no intention of returning to Saudi Arabia. Applicant's mother is aware \nthat Applicant holds a security clearance. They are in contact by telephone almost daily \n(GE 3; Tr. 56, 60). \n \nApplicant's paternal grandfather, an Iraqi citizen, is in his 90s, and lives in \nJordan. He held several senior positions in the Iraqi government. Applicant met him in \n1988 and 1989 on family trips to Iraq, when she was a child. She met him again when \nhe traveled to the United States for heart surgery in the mid-1990s. Their next contact \nwas in 2008, when they exchanged personal emails for several months concerning \nApplicant's possible employment in Iraq by a U.S. federal agency. Their last contact was \nin late 2008. She testified that she is no longer in touch with him, as she has no desire \nto maintain contact with her father\u2019s family members, including her grandfather, \nbecause of her father\u2019s infidelities. According to her mother, Applicant's grandfather now \nsuffers from dementia. (GE 3; Tr. 61-68). \n \n\n \n \n4 \n                                                \nApplicant has a paternal uncle who is a citizen of Iraq and Canada, and lives in \nJordan. She met him four times: during a family trip to Iraq in 1988; in 1989; in Canada \nin approximately 2001; and in Jordan in 2008. She was visiting her sister who was on a \nstudy-abroad program in Jordan. Other than these four visits, she has had no contact \nwith him. Her uncle is an engineer but is currently unemployed. She noted in her \ninterrogatory response that he left Iraq in 2001 \u201cduring the tyrant Ba\u2019ath regime period \nwhere many Iraqis that had the opportunity to leave did.\u201d Although the SOR alleges that \nthis uncle was exiled from Iraq, Applicant testified that she knows nothing about the \nexile, and only heard of it when she received the DOHA interrogatories.3 She also \nknows of no connections between her uncle and foreign militaries or governments (GE \n3; Tr. 68-77). \n \nApplicant also has a paternal uncle, aunt and cousin who are citizens of Iraq and \nCanada, and live in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Applicant's uncle is now retired, \nbut worked approximately 25 years providing services to a UAE government agency.4 \nApplicant's aunt manages a spa. Her cousin is a housewife, married to a U.S. citizen, \nand living in the UAE. Applicant is in touch with her uncle and aunt two to three times \nper year when her uncle has medical treatments in a U.S. clinic. She last saw her \ncousin in 2005. Aside from her uncle\u2019s former employment with a government agency, \nher uncle, aunt, and cousin have no government, military or political connections, as far \nas Applicant is aware. They do not know that Applicant is applying for a security \nclearance (Tr. 78-87). \n \n \nApplicant completed security clearance applications in December 2007 and \nMay 2008. Applicant listed only her parents and two sisters. Beyond the 16 types of \nrelatives that must be disclosed, the application requires disclosure of \u201cOther \nRelatives,\u201d with instructions to \u201cinclude only foreign national relatives not listed in 1-16 \nwith whom you or your spouse are bound by affection, obligation, or close and \ncontinuing contact.\u201d Applicant did not list her relatives who are foreign citizens and \nreside abroad. At her security interview of September 2008, she disclosed 23 foreign \nrelatives, not including her parents and one deceased grandmother. She has varied \nlevels of contact with these relatives. She is in touch with her maternal grandmother, \nwho lives in the United States, four times per year. She is in contact with some foreign \naunts, uncles and cousins two to three times per year, others once every three years, \nsome once every seven to ten years, and some she has met only once in her life. She \ndenies that she deliberately omitted her foreign relatives, and told the agent that her \nfailure to list them was due to oversight. At the hearing, she stated that she thought \nthat the question was \u201ckind of vague and I wanted to get the form done.\u201d She did not \nconsult with anyone about how to complete the question. She testified that she does \n \n3 The only reference in the evidence to Applicant's uncle being exiled is a statement in the DOHA interrogatory that \nhe \u201chas been exiled from Iraq or is not welcome back into Iraq.\u201d I have not considered this statement, as the record \ncontains no relevant supporting testimony or documentation (GE 3; Tr. 69-70). \n \n4 According to Applicant's testimony, the SOR mistakenly identified her uncle in Jordan as the one who \nworked for UAE Customs, when in fact, it is her uncle in the UAE who held that position (Tr. 79). \n\n \n \n5 \nnot have a close relationship with any of the undisclosed family members and had no \nintent to falsify her response (GE 2, 3, 4; Tr. 108-109). \n \nApplicant admits that she deliberately failed to disclose that she used marijuana \nbetween 2000 and 2005, in response to question 24(a) (illegal use of a controlled \nsubstance within the previous seven years\u20142000 to 2007) on both applications. During \nfollow-up interviews with investigators from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \nin June and September 2008, she disclosed that she started using marijuana in 2000, at \n16 years of age, when she was in high school. She used it approximately once per \nmonth, usually at parties, with the frequency declining over time. After she was arrested \nfor underage drinking in 2002, she did not use marijuana again in the United States. \nShe did use it when she was in Amsterdam between 2003 and 2005. Her last use \noccurred in March 2005, when she was 25 years old. During her subject interview in \nJune 2008, she explained that she did not disclose her drug use on her security \nclearance application because she was given \u201cbad advice\u201d and because of \u201cfiguring the \nyears incorrectly.\u201d The DOHA interrogatory of April 2009 asked Applicant to explain \nthese reasons more fully, but she did not (GE 1 \u2013 4; Tr. 119).  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she falsified her answer about drug use on \nthe December 2007 application because she would be embarrassed if her employer \nknew she had used illegal drugs. She also wanted to cover it up because she feared \nthat she would lose her job if she disclosed it. Applicant sought advice from a co-worker, \nand was advised to answer \u201cNo.\u201d She testified that even if she had not received that \nadvice, she is unsure if she would have answered the question honestly. After \ncompleting the 2007 security clearance application, she did not inform any company \npersonnel of her falsification, and she received a security clearance. In May 2008, \nApplicant completed a second application to apply for a higher level security clearance. \nShe again falsified her response to the question about drug use during the previous \nseven years, in order not to expose the previous lie. The following month, Applicant was \ninformed of her upcoming security interview, and decided to disclose her falsification. At \nthe point in the interview when the agent asked about illegal drug use, Applicant \ndisclosed her use. On the day of the security interview, she also informed her \nimmediate supervisor of her falsification. Several months later, she informed her \nsecond-line supervisor, and her federal client. She also told her mother and her younger \nsister. Applicant testified that she will not use illegal drugs again, and she will not lie \nbecause \u201cit\u2019s just not in me to continue lying.\u201d (GE 3; Tr. 88, 92-106, 123-124). \n \n \nApplicant submitted two character references (AE A and B). A friend who helped \nher obtain an internship at his company, who has known Applicant for approximately \neight years, stated that she is energetic and professional and performed her \nassignments in an outstanding manner. He knows about her falsification, but maintains \nthat she is honest and trustworthy. Applicant also received the recommendation of a \nsenior program manager who has known her since 2007. He worked with her \nintermittently in 2007 and became her supervisor in mid-2008. He is also a personal \nfriend. He found her to be a dedicated worker, who is mature, professional, trustworthy, \n\n \n \n6 \nand demonstrates sound judgment. He is aware of her falsification, but believes it was \nan anomaly. Applicant's second-line supervisor, who hired Applicant for her current \nposition in 2007, testified at the hearing. She noted that Applicant receives excellent \nperformance evaluations, is reliable and professional, and has a high level of integrity. \nWhen Applicant informed her that she had falsified her security clearance application, \u201cIt \nsurprised me. I would not have expected it from her.\u201d However, it did not change her \nopinion and she believes Applicant will not engage in such deception again (Tr. 19-40). \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nIraq (Hearing Exhibit 1) \n \nIn 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from \npower in Iraq. Following the swift invasion and successful removal from power, the \nUnited States endeavored to set a solid foundation of democratic institutions in Iraq. \nThe Constitution in Iraq was ratified on October 15, 2005. After free elections in 2005, \nIraq's new government, a parliamentary democracy, took office in March 2006.  \n \nIn 2007, 92 percent of Iraq\u2019s exports were in crude oil and crude oil materials. \nAlmost half of Iraq\u2019s exports went to the United States. The ultimate goal of the United \nStates in Iraq is to establish a peaceful, united, stable, democratic, and secure nation \nthat will be an ally of the United States in the war against terrorism. The United States \nhas invested thousands of lives and billions of dollars to assist in the reconstruction of \nIraq. Success in Iraq is a high national priority of the United States.  \n \nDespite the elections and new government, Baghdad, Mosul and several other \nareas have especially serious problems with violent terrorists and insurgents. Although \nthere have been recent improvements in the security environment, Iraq remains \ndangerous, volatile and unpredictable. Some areas of Iraq are more peaceful and less \nsusceptible to terrorist attacks than others; however, all areas of the country are still \nvery dangerous. Terrorists have the ability to strike most areas of the country with \nexplosive devices and mines. Numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the \nU.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with U.S. \nand Iraqi aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in \nIraq remains very high. Terrorist groups can conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as state intelligence services.  \n \nSaudi Arabia (Hearing Exhibit 2) \n \nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by the Al Saud Family. There \nare no national elections or political parties. The country\u2019s law is based on Islamic law \nor Shari\u2019a. Abuse of human rights is a concern. Reports of torturing prisoners, \ndiscrimination based on gender, religion, sect, and ethnicity, and other human rights \nviolations continue. Although the law guarantees the inviolability of homes and privacy \nof mail, authorities routinely open mail and use informants and wiretaps. The Saudi \n\n \n \n7 \ngovernment\u2019s foreign policy objectives focus on maintaining its security and position on \nthe Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia signed the United Nations charter in 1948 and is a \nmember of OPEC. Because of its position, Saudi Arabia frequently helps mediate \nregional crises and supports peace with Israel. Saudi Arabia and the United States \nshare common concerns about regional security, oil, and sustainable development. \n \nThe U.S. established formal diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia in 1933. \nBecause of the long-standing security relationship with Saudi Arabia, the United States \nsells military equipment to Saudi Arabia. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in \nthe United States, strains in the relationship between the two countries developed \nbecause a number of the terrorists were Saudi nationals. From May 2003 until June \n2004, a terrorist organization directly affiliated with al-Qaida launched a series of \nviolent attacks in Saudi Arabia, resulting in death and serious injury to U.S. citizens. \nThe Saudi security services waged an active counterterrorism campaign, which largely \nneutralized this organization. Thereafter, Saudi Arabia became a partner in the \ncampaign against terrorism, providing military, diplomatic and financial cooperation. \nThis cooperation continues. \n \nIn June 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department cited Al Haramain Islamic \nFoundation (AHF) with headquarters in Saudi Arabia, for providing financial and \nmaterial support to al-Qaida, as well as a wide range of terrorist organizations. \nSubsequent to this designation, Saudi authorities took actions that have largely \nprecluded AHF from operating in its own name. The U.S. Treasury Department also \ndesignated the Saudi-based International Islamic Relief Organization for facilitating \nfundraising for al-Qaida and affiliated terrorist groups. The Saudi government continues \nits efforts to disrupt funding of terror-related operations and continues to cooperate with \nthe United States. This cooperation has led to the arrest of 16 Saudi-based terrorism \nfinanciers and the successful implementation of new Saudi Customs cash-courier \nregulations.  \n \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) (Hearing Exhibit 3) \n \nThe UAE is a federation of individually ruled emirates. The government is a \nfederal republic with a president and council of ministers. Its laws and practices come \nfrom Islamic ideals and beliefs. Only 15 to 20 percent of the people living in the UAE \nare considered citizens. Educational standards are high and continue to improve.  \n \nThe UAE has significant gas and oil reserves which are expected to last into the \nnext century. This gives the UAE significant resources to invest around the world. The \nUAE is a member of the United Nations, the Arab League, and the Gulf Cooperation \nCounsel. It has diplomatic relations with more than 60 countries including the United \nStates and other major industrial nations. UAE is also active in the Organization of \nPetroleum Exporting Countries and the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting \nCounties.  \n \n\n \n \n8 \n                                                \nThe United States and UAE have had friendly relations since 1971. The breadth \nand depth of the relationship increased significantly as a result of the United States led \ncoalition campaign to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991. In 2002, the United \nStates and the UAE launched a strategic partnership dialogue covering virtually every \naspect of the relationship. The UAE has been a key partner in the war on terror, and \nUAE ports host more U.S. Navy ships than any other port outside the U.S. The UAE \nhas cooperated with the United States on terrorism. However, the UAE was one of only \nthree countries to recognize the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. Moreover, two of the 9/11 \nhijackers were UAE nationals, and they reportedly used UAE-based financial networks \nin the plot. Since then, the UAE is credited by the State Department with assisting in \nthe arrest of senior al-Qaida operatives, denouncing terror attacks, improving border \nsecurity and investigating suspect financial transactions. Allegations of illicit sale of \ntechnology continued in 2009, including assertions that Iran used UAE companies to \nobtain technology from U.S. suppliers, and that components were used to build \nimprovised explosive devices (IEDs) shipped to militants in Iraq and Afghanistan.  \nDubai is a key transfer point for the illegal sale of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya, and \nNorth Korea. \n \nThe UAE does not allow elections, lacks judicial independence, and restricts \ncivil liberties. There were no reports of arbitrary killings or politically motivated \ndisappearance. However, flogging is a recognized punishment. While the law prohibits \narrests and searches without probable cause, incidents do take place in practice. Fair \nand public but not timely trials are provided.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.5 Decisions \nmust also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the \nGuidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guidleline E (Personal Conduct).   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \n \n5 Directive. 6.3. \n\n \n \n9 \n                                                \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.7 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as her or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the \nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or \nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target \nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201cContact with a foreign family \nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \n \n \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n10 \nAlthough foreign family ties are not automatically disqualifying, they do raise the \nissue of potential foreign influence and the risk of exploitation or coercion. Although \nApplicant\u2019s father is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and previously resided in the United \nStates, he has lived in Saudi Arabia since 2008. When he lived in the United States, \nshe had frequent contact with him. In 2008, his behavior caused them to become \nestranged, and her parents are currently obtaining a divorce. Applicant has had no \ncontact with him since 2008 and plans to have no contact with him in the future. Her \ngrandfather lives in Iraq, and worked in senior Iraqi government positions. She has an \nuncle in Jordan whom she has met four times. She also has an aunt, uncle, and cousin \nin the UAE. This uncle worked for the UAE government for approximately 25 years until \nhe retired five years ago. She has contact with her aunt and uncle two to three times \nper year when her uncle visits the United States for medical appointments. She has \nless contact with her cousin, their daughter. Applicant has numerous other extended \nforeign family members in the Middle East. AG \u00b6 7(a) applies. \n \nThe foreign influence guideline also includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. Under AG \u00b6 8, the following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members reside in several Middle Eastern countries where \nthe threat of terrorist activity is high.  However, her contact with her family members is \ncasual and infrequent in most cases, and nonexistent in other cases. She has no \nfurther contact with her father or her grandfather. She has met her unemployed uncle \nonly four times, two of them when she was a child. Although she sometimes sees her \nuncle and aunt who live in the UAE, it is infrequent, and the relationship is not close. \nShe has little to no contact with her other extended family. Although the countries in \nquestion raise questions of possible exploitation, the Applicant's relationship with her \nforeign relatives is so infrequent and tenuous that it is unlikely to create a risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. AG \u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \n\n \n \n11 \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying condition under \nAG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe government alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her \nnumerous family members who are foreign citizens and reside abroad. Applicant \ndenies that her omission was deliberate. AG \u00b6 16(a) requires a deliberate and knowing \nintent to provide false information to the government. Applicant revealed that she had \nan immediate family member, her father, who was a citizen of Iraq and lived in Saudi \nArabia. If she intended to conceal her foreign connections, it is unlikely she would have \ndisclosed this information. Applicant was careless in failing to list her foreign relatives; \nhowever, I find that Applicant's omission was not intentional and AG \u00b6 16(a) does not \napply to that omission.  \n \nThe SOR also alleges, and Applicant admits, that she deliberately falsified \nanswers regarding her illegal drug use on security clearance applications in 2007 and \n2008. During her subsequent security interview, she disclosed marijuana use over a \nperiod of five years, from 2000 to 2005. Applicant knowingly and with intent to falsify, \nfailed to inform the government of her illegal drug use on two separate occasions. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) applies to her falsification concerning her drug use. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following mitigating conditions are relevant to Applicant's \nfalsification about her use of illegal drugs: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n\n \n \n12 \n \nApplicant's falsifications in 2007 and in 2008 are unmitigated. From December \n2007, when she first falsified, until June 2008, when she admitted her deception, she \ndid not disclose her falsifications to her supervisor or facility security officer. When she \nlearned of her upcoming security interview, she still did not disclose her falsification. \nDuring the interview, she did not disclose it until she was asked about illegal drug use. \nOnly at that point did she disclose that she had lied on her applications. Applicant's \nfalsifications in 2008 are recent, occurring approximately 18 months ago. Moreover, \nher conduct cannot be considered minor. She decided to provide false information to \nthe government not once but twice. Such actions undermine the security clearance \nprocess and raise serious doubts about Applicant's reliability and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(a) and 17(c) cannot be applied. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant provided false information to the government concerning her illegal \ndrug use. She decided to intentionally mislead the government on two separate \noccasions. She failed to disclose her falsification to her supervisor or facility security \nofficer. When she did disclose her illegal drug use, she told the agent that she lied \nbecause she made a mistake in figuring out the time period that the question covered. \nApplicant stated the true reason at the hearing: that she falsified because she was \nafraid her illegal drug use would put her job and clearance in jeopardy. Although it is \nnot alleged, and is not the basis for my decision, her lack of openness with the agent \ncan be considered under the whole person analysis. Some of Applicant's poor \njudgment can be ascribed to her young age of 24 years at the time of her falsifications. \nHowever, she is a well-educated, intelligent woman who made a conscious decision to \n\n \n \n13 \nfalsify when she completed the two applications. Moreover, when she falsified the \nsecond application, she held a secret security clearance. Those who are granted a \nsecurity clearance enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on \ntrust. A decision to falsify while holding a security clearance raises serious doubts \nabout Applicant's judgment and trustworthiness. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy these doubts, which must be \nresolved in favor of the national security. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline E. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. -1.g.:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.b.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c. \u2013 2.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________________ \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He served in the United States Navy from June 1977 to June 1997, receiving an honorable discharge (AE J). He has worked as a field service representative with his current employer since October 2006. He seeks a security clearance. He has held a security clearance for about 32 years. In his SCA (GE 2), Applicant listed all six debts identified in the SOR.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on May 18, 2007.\nOn January 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\nApril 29, 2009\n\n Earlier in the hearing, AE I was not admitted in evidence on relevancy grounds. After a careful examination\n1\nof the exhibit, the testimony and other documents related to the exhibit, I reversed my ruling (Tr. 71), finding\nthe exhibit to be relevant to the status of delinquent debts identified in SOR 1.a. and 1.b.\n2\nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on January 30, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on March 3, 2009 for a hearing on March 24, 2009. At the hearing,\nfour exhibits (GE I through 4) were admitted in evidence without objection to support the\ngovernment's case. Applicant testified and submitted nine exhibits (AE A-AE I).  In the\n1\ntime allowed for him to furnish additional documentation, he submitted AE J through O.\nDOHA received the transcript on April 10, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 50 years old and married. Applicant has one child from his current\nmarriage and four children from a previous marriage. He served in the United States\nNavy from June 1977 to June 1997, receiving an honorable discharge (AE J). He has\nworked as a field service representative with his current employer since October 2006.\nHe seeks a security clearance. He has held a security clearance for about 32 years. In\nhis SCA (GE 2), Applicant listed all six debts identified in the SOR.\nThe SOR has six allegations under the financial considerations guideline, totaling\nmore than $16,000. The debts became delinquent in 2004 and 2005 (GE 3, 4). In his\nanswer, he denied SOR 1.a. and 1.b., claiming both accounts were settled. The two\naccounts have been forgiven and are subject to a claims procedure by a receiver for the\nstate court. The law firm handling the two accounts went into receivership, and\nApplicant is trying to recover his payments from a receiver. Applicant essentially\nacknowledged by implication he owed SOR 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f., until he settled the\naccounts in January 2009. Regarding SOR 1.e., Applicant indicates he tried to settle the\naccount but the creditor would not oblige. \nSOR 1.a. ($1,325), 1.b. ($2,322). The last activity on the SOR 1.a. account was\nin August 2005. The last activity of the SOR 1.b. account was in July 2004. On October\n22, 2008, the state court entered a settlement agreement between the SOR 1.a./1.b.\ncreditor and the receiver on behalf of the receivership entities (including law firm where\nApplicant had been making payments) and about 20,000 customers. Under the terms of\nthe settlement, the SOR 1.a/1.b. creditor agreed to forgive all amounts owed, and to\nrequest the credit agencies remove the entries from the credit reports of each customer.\nThe receiver advised customers that they would have to file a claim for the return of\npayments made to the receivership entities. On November 25, 2008, Applicant filed a\nproof of claim to the receiver (GE 2). As of March 21, 2009, no final decision had been\nmade regarding Applicant\u2019s claim of $3,296. Projected payments of claims were\ndelayed from the original date of April 2009 to December 2009 (AE I).\nSOR 1.c. ($1,758). The last activity on this account was in August 2005. The\naccount was settled in January 2009 (AE A). \n\n No additional information was provided. It should be noted that Applicant did not begin receiving his military\n2\nretirement ($600) until about 2007. See, DD 214 (AE J).\n3\nSOR 1.d. ($565). The discount department store account was settled in late\nFebruary or early March 2009 (AE H, M).\nSOR 1.e. ($10,686). The account became delinquent in June 2004. Applicant\nindicates he attempted to work out a settlement with the creditor on many occasions.\nThe creditor, according to Applicant, chose to write the account off, and submit pertinent\ntax forms to Applicant (AE N).\nSOR 1.f. ($3,184). The account became delinquent on June 2004. Applicant was\nnotified on February 20, 2009 that his payments of $1,931 were sufficient to settle the\naccount (AE F).\nApplicant provided two principal explanations for his inability to pay the\ndelinquent creditors in 2004 and 2005. He referred to AE B (Social Security Earnings\nstatement) to show his earnings went from about $76,000 in 2003 to $53,000 in 2005;\nhis earnings returned to approximately $67,000 for 2007. Applicant has never\nencountered any periods of unemployment (Tr. 35-36).\nApplicant\u2019s second reason for not paying his delinquent debts is related to a state\njudge located in the midwestern United States. Applicant testified:\n[A]nd my child support was also supposed to be reduced by one-quarter of\nthe total of $600 when my first son graduated, which happened in 2005.\nThe judge at that time refused to reduce the child support stating that I\nwas currently paying less than the state of [midwestern state] mandated\nand he would not entertain reducing the child support. If I wished him to\nconsider further, I would not be happy with the outcome (Tr. 40).  \n2\nBetween 2004 and 2008, Applicant attempted to resolve his financial problems\nby enrolling in a debt settlement service in June 2004. Applicant avers he paid $250 a\nmonth for six months, but discontinued his enrollment when the creditors continue to\nharass him (Tr. 34). Other than AE C (the contract signed by Applicant), there is no\nevidence to show where the payments went.\nTo keep expenses down, Applicant indicated that the family did not dine out (Tr.\n39). Also, with the objective of keeping expenses down, Applicant remained at home to\ncare for their child while his wife worked at a local outlet of a national discount store (Tr.\n38). \nAttached to Applicant\u2019s answers to interrogatories (GE 2) is a personal financial\nstatement (PFS, December 2008) showing that Applicant\u2019s net monthly income is\n$5,536. Subtracting his expenses and debts from the net monthly income leaves a\nmonthly remainder of $1,994 (Id.) Applicant testified he was using the monthly\n\n4\nremainder to pay down his four current credit cards (Tr. 47-49). AE 3 (credit report\ndated October 27, 2008) shows that Applicant has no other accounts falling delinquent\nafter 2005.\nDuring the hearing, Applicant indicated he opened a signature loan for $5,000 in\nJanuary 2009. He used the loan to settle the delinquent accounts identified in SOR 1.c.,\n1.d., and 1.f. (Tr. 64). \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s military performance evaluation for 1996 was above standards (AE\nK). In his performance  evaluation for 2007 and 2008, Applicant exceeded expectations\nof his supervisors (AE L). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\n\n5\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n\u00b618. The Concern. \"Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\"\nFC disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC \u00b619.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) are applicable to the\ncircumstances of this case. Applicant has been unable to pay more than $16,000 in\ndelinquent debt to six creditors. The four to five-year period of delinquency of each of\nthe debts demonstrates a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nEvidence of financial problems may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC)\n\u00b620.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment). This condition applies in part as\nApplicant has settled with five of six creditors, even though he has created new debt\n(the $5,000 loan) to pay off old debt. \nFC MC \u00b620.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control and individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\nmay apply in those circumstances where events outside the person's control contributed\nto the financial difficulty. Applicant\u2019s loss of some income in 2004 is self-explanatory.\nBut, his earnings improved within a short period of time. In addition, his wife was\nworking too. On balance, his declining income claim is not persuasive. \nApplicant\u2019s $600-child support obligation to his children from his first marriage is\na more persuasive reason for his inability to pay his delinquent accounts. The child\nsupport ended in 2007, giving Applicant a chance to turn his attention to his delinquent\ndebts. Applicant\u2019s enrollment in the debt firm in 2007, and his settlement of three\n\n6\nadditional creditors in January 2009, afford Applicant some mitigation under both prongs\nof FC MC \u00b620.b. \nFC MC \u00b620.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\nis applicable although Applicant has had very little financial counseling. He exercised\ngood judgment in seeking financial assistance through the two debt settlement\norganizations. His efforts have resulted in  the settlement of five of the six listed\ncreditors. \nApplicant also receives some credit under FC MC \u00b620.d. (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) for the\nsuccessful resolution of five of six creditors, notwithstanding the fact he has increased\nhis debt by 500%. Given Applicant\u2019s favorable job performance evidence and success\nin settling with five of six creditors, I am confidant Applicant will continue to work out a\nresolution for the account in SOR 1.e. Accordingly, I find for Applicant under the FC\nguideline.  \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the FC guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG \u00b6 2(a)\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigation conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the case. Applicant was in the United States Navy\nfor 20 years. He received an honorable discharge in June 1997. He has held a security\nclearance since 1977. The credit reports show that six debts became delinquent in 2004\nand 2005. To Applicant\u2019s credit, the reports also show no additional delinquent debt\nafter 2005. He signed on with the first debt settlement plan in 2004, but stopped his\naffiliation when the creditors continued to call. In 2007, Applicant enrolled in another\ndebt settlement service that encountered financial problems in October 2008. Given\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly remainder of almost $2,000 in December 2008, he could have\nsaved three or four months and paid the delinquent accounts in SOR 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f.\nHowever, Applicant testified he has been using the remainder to pay down his four\nother creditors. I find his testimony credible. \n\n7\nJudging by the totality of the circumstances, Applicant exercised poor judgment\nin not addressing the delinquent accounts at an earlier point in time. He compounded\nhis poor judgment by taking out a loan when a better choice was available through his\nmonthly, discretionary income. On the other hand, Applicant provided documented\nevidence that he was addressing two of the listed delinquent accounts in 2004 and\ndefinitely in 2007, a long time before he received the SOR. For this reason, I find for him\nunder the FC guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted owing six delinquent debts, which totaled approximately $41,000 and denied owing four debts, which totaled approximately $45,000. In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he asserts the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($8,609) is the same debt as that listed in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($17,389). He also asserts the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($7,519) is the same debt as that listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($16,831). He denies the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($16,706). He denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($3,409) because the debt has been paid. Applicant admitted the remaining allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 40-year-old quality assurance inspector who has worked for a defense contractor since July 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. In 2002, Applicant was the owner-operator of a small trucking company. In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he states a business downturn resulted in him dissolving the business and selling his equipment. In his July 18, 2008 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), Applicant stated he was injured (not further explained) and was unable to continue his business.

Applicant admitted the remaining allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough \nreview of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old quality assurance inspector who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since July 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. In \n2002, Applicant was the owner-operator of a small trucking company. In Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR, he states a business downturn resulted in him dissolving the \nbusiness and selling his equipment. In his July 18, 2008 Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP), Applicant stated he was injured (not further \nexplained) and was unable to continue his business. (Item 5)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s December 2008 credit bureau report (CBR) lists two judgments with \nthe same creditor in the amounts of $7,519 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $6,967 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Item \n6, page 1 of 4) The same judgments are listed on Applicant\u2019s August 2008 CBR. (Item \n7, page 4 of 21) In this response to the SOR, Applicant asserts the $7,519 judgment \nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.a is the same debt listed as owed to a different creditor. (SOR \u00b6 1.i, \n$16,831) Applicant provided no documentation supporting his assertion that the two \ndebts were one obligation. \n \n \nApplicant provided a February 2009 letter from a law firm collecting for the lender \nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 1.b, which indicated the law firm had agreed to accept a down \npayment of $228 on or before March 25, 2009, and additional monthly payments of \n$228 on the 25th of subsequent months. (Response to SOR, Attachment 2) Applicant \n\n3 \n \n \nprovided no documentation that payment was made in accord with the offer of \nsettlement. \n \n \nApplicant provided a March 2009 letter from the lender of the debts listed in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c ($400) and SOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,029). Both accounts were settled in full. (Response to \nSOR, Attachments 3, 4A, and 4B) The debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($8,609) and SOR \u00b6 1.j \n($17,389) have been settled provided Applicant\u2019s check was not returned. (Response to \nSOR, Attachments 5 and 6) The collection agency\u2019s letter references the original \ncreditor. \n \n \nThe collection account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($3,409) was settled in full. (SOR \nresponse, Attachment 7) The law firm collecting the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($7,534) \nagreed to accept a down payment of $1,230 on or before August 28, 2008 and to \naccept $200 on September 28, 2008 and $200 monthly on the 28th of subsequent \nmonths. (Response to SOR, Attachment 8) As of February 2009, the law firm had \nreceived $2,230 on this agreement, which was the amount Applicant was to have \nprovided by that date. However, Applicant has failed to provide documentation of any \npayments after February 27, 2009.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s August 2008 CBR and December 2008 CBR lists three collection \naccounts with the same collection agency. The accounts include: a $15,835 balance \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i, $16,831); a $15,528 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.h, $16,706); and an $8,578 balance \n(the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). (Item 7, page14 of 21 and page 15 of 21) \nApplicant was summoned to answer a complaint against him by this collection agency. \n(SOR response Attachment 9) The summons states a copy of the complaint was \nattached; however the complaint is not included in the FORM. Without the complaint it is \nimpossible to determine to which of the three accounts the complaint refers.  \n \nHowever, Applicant admits owing this collection agency the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.i. He arranged to make a down payment of $288 on or before March 25, 2009, and \nmake subsequent payments of $288 on the 25th of subsequent months beginning on \nApril 25, 2009. (Response to SOR, Attachment 1) Applicant provided no documentation \nhe made any of the payments.  \n \n \nIn his May 2007 answer to the summons, Applicant stated he did not owe the \ndebt and demanded trial by jury. (SOR response Attachments 10 and 11) Applicant \nprovides this information when he is referencing the account placed for collection listed \nin SOR \u00b6 1.h ($16,706). The collection account was listed in Applicant\u2019s March 2008 \nCBR. (Item 7) Applicant asserts there have been no additional efforts to collect this debt \nfollowing his answer to the summons. The summons and Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nsummons are insufficient to establish the debt has been paid or is no longer a legal \nobligation.  \n \n \nThe FORM put Applicant on notice that documentation was lacking to support his \nassertion that two of the debts were for the same obligation, that he had made payment \n\n4 \n \n \nin accord with the two settlement offers, and that he did not owe the debt listed in SOR \n\u00b61.h. No further documentation was received.  \n \n \nA summary of the SOR debts follows: \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount  \nCurrent Status \na \nCredit card \ncompany judgment. \n \n \n$7,519 \nUnpaid.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n\n6 \n \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant admitted owing six delinquent debts, which totaled approximately \n$41,000 and denied owing four debts, which totaled approximately $45,000. Applicant \nwas put on notice in the FORM that documentation supporting his assertions would be \nnecessary. No documentation was received. Applicant asserts, but failed to document, \nthe judgment listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($7,519) was the same debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i. He \nhas not made payment on either debt. He asserts he has reached agreement to repay \nthe accounts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($6,967) and SOR \u00b6 1.i ($16,831). However, he \nprovided no documentation showing payments have been made supporting the \nsettlement offers.  \n \nThe account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($16,706) remains unpaid. Applicant denied this \ndebt and asserted there had been no further efforts to collect this debt. However, he \n\n7 \n \n \nreceived a summons related to this debt and the documentation he provided, the \nsummons and his answer to it, are insufficient to support his assertion he no longer \nowes this debt. These four debts total in excess of $38,000.  \n \n \nApplicant has failed to establish he had paid four debts, which total $38,726. \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant asserts his financial problems began in 2002, when he was the owner-\noperator of a small trucking company, and either a business downturn or an injury \nprevented him from continuing his business. There is no evidence that four of the debts \nwere paid or otherwise addressed to show there are not of security concern. I am \nunable to conclude they occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to \nrecur and do not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \nAG & 20(b) has limited applicability because Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nstarted with a business down turn or injury, which are conditions beyond his control. \nHowever, that event occurred seven years ago and four of the debts remain \nunaddressed.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nAG & 20(c) does not apply because there is no evidence Applicant has received \nany financial counseling nor is there a clear indication that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control since the four debts, which total in excess of $38,000, remain unpaid.  \n \nAG & 20(d) applies to the six debts (SOR \u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i) that \nwere settled. He has shown a good-faith effort to repay these obligations. I find for \nApplicant as to SOR \u00b6 1.g even though he failed to document he was making the \npayments required by the settlement offer. He provided no cancelled checks or other \ndocumentation establishing payment. I find for him as to this debt because the creditor\u2019s \nletter of February 2009 (Response to SOR, Attachment 8) stated the creditor had \nreceived $2,230.  \n \nApplicant has failed to document a good-faith effort to repay the four remaining \ndebts. For AG\u00b6 20 (d) to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d \nto repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of \nhandling these four debts is needed, which is not present here. Applicant has shown \nthere was an offer to settle two of these debts. However, the offer was contingent on \npayment being made in a timely and systematic manner. There is no documentation \nthat payment was made or continued until the debt was paid.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about \nhis finances. He has settled six of the ten debts. Four debts totaling in excess of \n$38,000 have yet to be addressed.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \n\n9 \n \n \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future, having paid the four delinquent obligations, established \ncompliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise suitably addressed the obligations, he \nmay well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a \nclearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a and 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c\u20141.g: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h and 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a questionnaire for sensitive positions (SF 86) on June 5, \n2008. On March 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 7, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on May 19, 2009. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on May 20, 2009.  \nApplicant received the FORM on June 3, 2009. He had 30 days to submit a response to \nthe FORM. He did not submit a response. On August 4, 2009, the FORM was \nforwarded to the hearing office and assigned to me on that same date. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nAugust 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nMotion to Amend the Statement of Reasons \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the Statement of Reasons pursuant to \nE3.1.10 and E3.1.13 of the Directive by adding the following allegation: \n \n \n1.i. You are indebted to the U.S. Department of Education on a student \nloan account that has been placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $34,117. As of November 24, 2008, this debt had not been \npaid.  \n \nApplicant was served a copy of the proposed amendment within the FORM. He \nwas given 30 days to respond to the FORM as well as the proposed amendment to the \nSOR. No response was submitted. Applicant was provided adequate notice. The motion \nto amend the SOR is approved. (Note: Department Counsel labeled the motion to \namend the SOR as paragraph 2.i. It should actually be paragraph 1.i and is marked as \nsuch.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denies all of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.h. (Item 3) He did not respond to the motion to amend the SOR. I am treating his lack \nof response to the motion to amend the SOR as a denial. (Item 2) \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor. He \nseeks a security clearance.  He has been employed as a security officer since June \n2008. He is married and has three adult children. (Item 4)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed the following delinquent accounts:  \na judgment in the amount of $8,259 entered against Applicant in October 2002 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a: Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 1); a judgment in the amount of $3,474 entered against \nApplicant in March 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 1); a $53 phone account \nplaced for collection in May 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 1); a $911 cell \nphone account placed for collection in March 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 1); \na $285 medical account placed for collection in September 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item 5 at \n5; Item 6 at 1); a $276 account placed for collection in August 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Item 5 \nat 4); a $354 cell phone account placed for collection in October 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Item \n5 at 6); and a $4,217 medical account placed for collection in May 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.h: \nItem 5 at 7). Applicant has approximately $34,117 in delinquent student loans that were \nplaced for collection in May 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Item 5 at 5, 6; Item 6 at 2).   \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant claimed the majority of the debts have \nbeen paid. He claims that his attorney has filed a motion to vacate to two default \njudgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He claims the $53 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c \nwas a mistaken entry on his credit report. He claims he settled the account alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. He is disputing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. He claims medical \n\n \n3 \n \n \ninsurance paid the medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h. (Item 3) He did not \nprovide documentation verifying his assertions.  \n \nThe status of the delinquent student loan account remains uncertain because \nApplicant failed to respond to the FORM which contained the motion to amend the SOR \nby adding SOR \u00b6 1.i.  \n \nApplicant requests that his case be looked at with tempered mercy. He claims he \nis a law abiding citizen and would not violate or abridge his U.S. status. He will be \nchecking his credit reports from now on. (Item 3)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Between 2001 and 2008, Applicant \nincurred eight delinquent debts, totaling $17,829. He also has approximately $34,117 in  \ndelinquent student loans that have been placed for collection.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant continued to incur delinquent accounts as recently as May 2008 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6                      \n1.c, 1.h, and 1.i). Although Applicant claims most of the accounts have been resolved, \nhe provided no documentation corroborating his assertions.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. Applicant did not explain \nthe cause of his financial problems. It is noted that two debts are medical debts (SOR \n\n \n5 \n \n \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h). However, they account for $4,502 of the $17,829 in debt. There is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude FC MC \u00b6 20(b) applies.    \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling. At the close of the record, the status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts \nremained uncertain. His financial situation is unlikely to be resolved in the near future. \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. While Applicant claims most of the \ndelinquent accounts are resolved, he provided no evidence to verify the accounts were \nresolved. He provided no information pertaining to his largest debt, the $34,117 \ndelinquent student loan account. It was Applicant\u2019s burden to provide sufficient evidence \nto show his accounts were being repaid or resolved. He provided no evidence to \ncorroborate his assertions. \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply. While Applicant claims he disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e, 1.f, and 1.g, he provided no documentation verifying the disputes or substantiating \nthe bases for the disputes. There is insufficient proof to apply FC MC \u00b6 20(e).  \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a significant amount \nof unresolved delinquent debt. He failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that \nmost of the debts are resolved. He did not provide sufficient evidence of the steps he is \ntaking towards resolving the remaining delinquent debt, including the significant \ndelinquent student loan account. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 17, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 23, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:  Applicant has admitted with\nexplanation the debts alleged in the SOR.  The SOR debts include ten state tax liens and an Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) lien.  The state liens total $19,505, and the IRS lien is for $37,898.  The liens\ninvolve the years 2000 through 2008, when Applicant operated his own business.  Applicant filed\ntax returns for those years, but did not have funds to pay the amounts due.  The other two debts in\nthe SOR involve a mortgage and a second mortgage on Applicant\u2019s house, which is now in\nforeclosure.  Applicant blames most of his financial difficulties on his former wife\u2019s excessive\nspending and his failure to curtail it.  When his wife filed for divorce, Applicant signed a property\nsettlement which assigned him the obligation to pay the mortgage and other debts.  Applicant pays\n$1,100 per month in child support for his daughter, as well as college tuition and other expenses for\nhis son, leaving net income of $600 per month.  Applicant is contemplating bankruptcy.  Applicant\nserved in the U.S. Army from1980 until 1983 and then in the National Guard until 1988 and held\na security clearance at that time without any violations of policy.  Applicant now works for a defense\ncontractor and submitted medallions and certificates of appreciation for his support of U.S. military\nforces, as well as a job evaluation indicating outstanding technical knowledge.\nIn his appeal, Applicant restates the circumstances surrounding his financial difficulties.  To\nthe extent that any of the information was not included in the record below, it cannot be considered,\nsince it is new evidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Likewise, four letters of recommendation and a letter\nfrom Applicant\u2019s attorney, all dated in January 2010, cannot be considered. \n In his decision, the Judge discussed five exhibits which Applicant submitted after the\nhearing.  The Judge indicated that the exhibits showed Applicant\u2019s technical expertise and his\ncontribution to military activities.  In his appeal, Applicant refers to two letters of recommendation\nwhich he says his employer lost.  Applicant does not explain the circumstances or the timing of the\nloss or the significance of the letters, and he does not provide copies of them.  It is clear that the\nJudge considered the exhibits Applicant submitted, and Applicant has not provided enough\ninformation to cause the Board to reopen the record.\nApplicant attached a letter to his appeal brief that he read at the hearing.  When Applicant\nread the letter aloud during the hearing, it became part of the record.  There is a rebuttable\n\nApplicant notes that in the Analysis section of the decision the Judge stated that Applicant had done nothing\n1\nto resolve his personal income tax liabilities.  Decision at 5.  However, Applicant points out that he used all of a federal\nincome tax refund of $5,800 in 2008 to reduce his debt to the IRS.  The Judge stated that fact in his Findings of Fact.\nDecision at 5.  If the Judge\u2019s failure to restate it in the Analysis section was error, it was harmless error, since it is\nunlikely that fact alone would have led to a different result.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-20062 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 15,\n2008).  \nApplicant argues that the Judge confused Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and his current fianc\u00e9e.  However, Applicant\u2019s\n2\ntestimony at pages 44-51 can reasonably be read as saying the same things about his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s role in his finances as the\nJudge wrote in his challenged Finding of Fact. \n3\npresumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence in the absence of clear evidence to the\ncontrary.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-03845 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2009).  In this case, it is clear\nthat the Judge considered the information contained in the letter, since he referred to the information\nin his decision. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified as to the causes of his financial difficulties.  That was\nmitigating evidence for the Judge to consider.  As discussed above, there is a rebuttable presumption\nthat the Judge considered it unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.   However, the presence\n1\nof some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.   A party\u2019s disagreement with\n2\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10454 at 2\n(App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2008). \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief focuses on the importance of his workplace to U.S. national security.\nApplicant\u2019s argument is misplaced because it sheds no light on the concerns in a security clearance\nadjudication.  Cf.  ISCR Case No. 99-0456 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2000); and ISCR Case No. 98-\n0370 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 1999).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He signed it again on May 7, 2009. On June 17, 2009, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2009. He answered the \nSOR in writing on July 7, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 12, 2009, and I received the \ncase assignment on August 27, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 31, \n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 14, 2009. The \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment offered Exhibits 1 through 3, which were received without objection. \nApplicant testified and did not submit any exhibits at the hearing. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 24, 2009. Subsequent to the hearing, \nApplicant requested permission to submit exhibits. The Department Counsel had no \nobjection to their submission, and Applicant submitted Exhibits A through E.  The record \nclosed on November 2, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 7, 2009, Applicant admitted all the factual \nallegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to \nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old, divorced in July 2008, and has two children.  He \noperated his own computer installation business from 2000 to 2008, when he went to \nwork for a defense contractor. Applicant served in the U.S. Army from 1980 to 1983, \nand then in the National Guard until approximately 1988. During that time, Applicant had \na security clearance without any violations of policy. (Tr. 14, 21-31, 44; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant blames his former wife\u2019s conspicuous consumption demands, and his \nweakness in not refusing them, for most of his delinquent debt and his inability to pay \nhis current list of delinquent debt in the SOR. His former wife was an officer of his \ncompany and had access to the checking accounts. She wanted a new house in 2000, \nand got one costing $205,000. She wanted a new car every year, and a private school \neducation for their oldest child that had tuition of $53,000 over four years. The marriage \nstarted to fall apart and they separated in December 2007. Without advice of legal \ncounsel, Applicant signed a property settlement, which assigned him the obligation to \npay the mortgage and other debts.  (Tr. 29-31, 66) \n \n \nApplicant incurred state and federal tax liabilities from his failure to pay sufficient \nincome tax withholding or estimated payments during the years he operated his \nbusiness. Applicant paid his business tax and other financial obligations. He filed all the \nreturns required, but he did not have the money to pay the taxes. He did not save \nmoney during each year with which to pay the income taxes. The 10 state tax liens \n(SOR Para. 1.a to 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k) listed in the SOR, totaling $19,505, arose from his \nfailure to pay his personal income taxes for several years when he owned his computer \nbusiness. He also owes $37,898 to the Internal Revenue Service (SOR Para. 1.i) for \npersonal income tax obligations. Applicant did not have an accountant handle his \nbusiness books and records for the first two years of the business operation.  He did not \nmanage his accounts receivable in the proper manner, and his income fluctuated from \nyear to year. He never paid himself a regular monthly income. He did pay his employee \npayroll taxes on time. Applicant does not have sufficient income from his current \n$57,000 annual salary to pay these delinquent debts. From his monthly net income after \ntaxes and deductions, he pays $1,100 in child support for his daughter who is under 18 \nyears of age.  He pays his son\u2019s college tuition and some other expenses, leaving him a \n\n \n3 \n \n \nremaining net income of about $600 monthly. He has no savings and little money in his \nchecking account. (Tr. 22, 23, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 44-46, 51-54, 56, 57, 68, 69; Exhibits \n2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant owes $195,000 on his home, which is currently in foreclosure \nproceedings. Applicant attempted to sell the home between 2007 and 2009, but was not \nable to do so. His plan was to take any gain from the house sale and repay his \ndelinquent debts. He also owes $15,000 on a home equity loan. Neither of these debts \nare repaid or otherwise resolved. Applicant concludes that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is \nthe only method to rid his record of these financial obligations. He has started paying an \nattorney to represent him in such a proceeding, if he can include the tax liens as \ndischargeable debt. (Tr. 35, 37-42, 47, 54; Exhibits 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant does not have any credit cards at the present time.  He used a $5,800 \nincome tax refund to repay part of his federal tax debt. He has maximum withholding \ntaken from his monthly paycheck. He does not have a retirement plan, nor does he \nhave health insurance because of the monthly $600 cost. Applicant has not obtained \nany consumer debt counseling regarding his debt and personal finances. He does not \nhave any other unpaid debts, other than his tax debts and the house loans. (Tr. 44, 48, \n65) \n \n \nApplicant is engaged.  He lives with his fianc\u00e9e and gives her his paycheck each \nmonth. From that money, she pays his alimony and child support payment of $1,100 \nmonthly, and his other expenses.  Applicant also pays for the auto insurance for his two \nchildren, and is required to pay about $600 worth of expenses for his daughter\u2019s school \ntrip to Washington, D.C.  Applicant claims he has no money remaining at the end of \neach month to pay any of his tax or home mortgage liabilities. Applicant did not provide \nany information that verifies where his income goes after he gives it to his fianc\u00e9e. His \nfinancial statement submitted in response to the interrogatories shows that he pays her \n$500 monthly rent and is paying the house mortgage and home equity loan.  Applicant \ntestified he paid the mortgage only a few times on the required schedule, and at the end \nof his marriage he did not have money to pay either the mortgage or the home equity \nloan. He does not have the present financial ability to pay those house loans. Applicant \ndeclared that he did not care about money, and it has only caused him pain. (Tr. 31, 38-\n40, 48-50, 52, 58, 59)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted exhibits showing three medallions he received for his work in \nsupport of U.S. military forces in his present employment, a certificate of appreciation \nfor providing information technology support during a training exercise, a certificate of \nappreciation for his technical support during a military exercise, another certificate of \nappreciation for his technical support during another military training exercise at his \nplace of employment, and his latest performance evaluation that shows he exceeds \nrequirements in all areas but one.  The evaluation shows his technical job knowledge is \n\u201coutstanding.\u201d (Exhibits A to E)   \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes nine conditions that could raise security concerns. From \nthese nine conditions, two disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable.  \n \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent tax debt and \nis unable to pay these obligations from his former business income or current salary. \nThese delinquent tax and house loan debts date back to 2000 when Applicant started \nhis business. Applicant admits owing all his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese two disqualifying conditions, \n \nThe guideline also includes six examples of conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties. Of these six conditions, three may \nhave some applicability. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ The financial problems \narose from his failure to pay his state and federal personal income taxes while operating \nhis business.  He blames his former wife for extravagant spending on a large house, \nannually obtaining new cars, and private school tuition for at least one of his children. \nApplicant admitted that he could not control his wife\u2019s spending habits, and may not \nhave tried to do so in order to avoid family arguments. Those actions were his fault and \nwithin his control. His business later started to fail, and he obtained a salaried position in \n2008. He paid his business debts, but has done nothing to pay or resolve his personal \nincome tax liabilities incurred in the 2000 to 2007 period. He has not paid his house \nmortgage or his home equity loan, or apparently made any attempt to do so. I find this \npotentially mitigating condition is not a factor for consideration in this case because \nApplicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances that gave rise to his \ndelinquent debts.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not obtained any counseling and has not \nresolved the delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement or other good-faith \nefforts. There are no clear indications that his financial problems are under control. I \nconclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was a businessman and \nan adult when he incurred his delinquent tax debts. He could not manage his business \nfinances properly during the life of his business from 2000 to 2008. Nor could he control \nhis wife\u2019s extravagant spending during the same time period. Applicant did not seek or \nobtain any financial counseling until 2008, nor has he made any efforts to resolve these \ndebts. There is a continuous pattern of financial mismanagement exhibited by Applicant \nover the past eight years. Because the debts are unresolved, even in the smallest \namount, there is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. His inability \nto control his finances shows there is a likelihood of continuation or recurrence \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement about not caring about money, coupled with his monthly \npractice of giving his fianc\u00e9e his income check without verifying where the money is \nspent, shows he is oblivious to his financial obligations. He wants to do his computer \nwork and have someone else handle his money for him. As stated above, during his \n\n \n7 \n \n \nyears in business he showed no ability to handle money, shown by his working without \nan accountant for the first two years, and his repeated failure to save money for taxes. \nThis attitude, coupled with his payments to his children for their expenses and auto \ninsurance, demonstrates he takes care of his family first rather than his tax liabilities. \nWhile that attitude might be noble, it also makes him vulnerable to pressures from the \nfamily or because of the family to ignore his legal duty to pay his debts and taxes. It may \nalso provide fertile ground for exploitation or duress in the future on other issues relating \nto classified information and its disclosure. I also conclude Applicant\u2019s actions show a \nlack of reliability in fulfilling his financial obligations. They also show a lack of good \njudgment in operating a business and his personal financial affairs.  \n \nIt is clear Applicant is a good employee and a conscientious worker for his \ncompany. He knows computers and can handle the technical work. His efforts are \nrecognized as shown by the certificates he submitted. However, these factors are not \nenough to overcome the financial mismanagement and chronic failure exhibited by \nApplicant to pay his income taxes over the past eight years. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. \nI conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.m.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He was\ncharged with possession of marijuana on August 8, 2008. He was convicted of that offense\nin or about October 2008, and placed on six months unsupervised probation. Applicant\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns created by his abuse of marijuana. Clearance is\ndenied.  \nOn February 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines H (drug involvement) and J (criminal\nconduct). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR, dated March 4, 2009, in which he\nadmitted all SOR allegations and requested a decision based on the written record without\na hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 24, 2009\n\n Under a state program, Applicant was permitted to attend the junior college while still in high school.   \n2\n2\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 28, 2009,\nthat was mailed to Applicant the same day. Applicant was notified he had 30 days from\nreceipt of the FORM to submit objections thereto or any additional information he wanted\nconsidered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on May 11, 2009. He did not\nobject to anything contained in the FORM or submit any additional information for\nconsideration. The case was assigned to me on June 17, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 25-year-old single man who has been employed as a digital design\nengineer by a defense contractor since July 2008. He graduated from high school and a\ncommunity college in June 2002.  He received a bachelor of arts degree in physics and a\n2\nbachelor of science degree in electrical engineering in June 2006. He is currently working\ntoward a master of science degree in electrical and computer engineering. He worked as\na salesman from June 2006 until August 2006, as a design engineer from September 2006\nuntil July 2008, and as a tutor from May 2008 until July 2008. He was unemployed from\nAugust 2006 until September 2006. He held a variety of jobs while he attended college. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on July 14, 2008. In response to a question asking if he had illegally used a controlled\nsubstance in the preceding seven years, Applicant admitted he used marijuana an\nundisclosed number of times between January 2002 and July 2008. He elaborated by\nstating:\nI recreationally smoked marijuana while in college, but when my course work\nbecame more intense and when my occupations became more professional\nmy recreational activities went to the wayside. I currently smoke marijuana\nas infrequently as 1 to 3 times a year when I am on vacation. Coincidentally\nmy last time I smoked marijuana was inbetween [sic] jobs when I was\ncelebrating the 4  of July with my friends. . . . \nth\nOn December 16, 2008, in response to interrogatories propounded to him by DOHA,\nApplicant acknowledged he last used of marijuana on November 26, 2008. He also\nasserted he decided after that last use that he would not again use marijuana because of\nthe recent trouble it had caused him and because he feared he would lose the\nopportunities presented to him by his current employment. \nApplicant now works in a different state from where most of his marijuana use\noccurred. His current work and social lifestyle leave him neither the time nor desire to\nsmoke marijuana. However, in his response to the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant\nacknowledged that five to six times a year he returns to the state where he formerly resided\nand visits with a couple of friends who continue to use marijuana.   \n\n The date entered on the sentencing document included as part of FORM Item 6 is  illegible. However, the dates\n3\non other documents in the FORM pertaining to the conviction indicate it occurred in October 2008, or earlier.\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n5\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n7\n3\nApplicant was charged with possession of marijuana on August 8, 2008. He was\nconvicted of that offense in or about October 2008.  Applicant was sentenced to serve six\n3\nmonths unsupervised probation, fined $512.50, ordered to perform 25 hours community\nservice, and required to obtain a drug evaluation. He successfully completed these\nconditions of probation. On November 4, 2008, Applicant obtained the court-ordered drug\nevaluation. The person conducting the evaluation concluded Applicant did not require\ntreatment. Applicant was ordered to not consume alcohol or drugs while on probation. He\nviolated this condition of probation when he smoked marijuana on November 26, 2008. \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant wrote:\nI believe that guidelines J and H are the same. I agree with them that illegal\ndrug use reflects that one wouldn\u2019t be willing to comply with laws . . . but I\ndisagree with it on its poor reflection on a persons reliability and\ntrustworthiness. I am a very reliable and trustworthy person, I just make\nmistakes. \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Guidelines H (drug involvement) and J (criminal conduct), with their\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, are most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6\nalthough the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden\nof proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of\n7\n\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n11\n Id at 531.\n12\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n13\n4\nthe evidence.\u201d  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n8\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\nApplicant illegally used marijuana an undisclosed number of times between January\n2002 and November 26, 2008. As of July 14, 2008, he admitted using it about one to three\ntimes a year while he was on vacation. He was convicted of possession of marijuana and\nplaced on six months probation in or before October 2008. He obtained a drug evaluation\non November 4, 2008. His last reported use of marijuana occurred after he submitted his\ne-QIP, while he was on probation and after he obtained the drug evaluation. Disqualifying\nCondition (DC) 25(a): any drug abuse applies.\nApplicant last used marijuana less than seven months ago. On December 16, 2008,\nhe averred he will not use marijuana again because of the trouble it has recently caused\nhim and because of the risk it poses to opportunities that may arise from his current\nemployment. However, his use of marijuana after he submitted his e-QIP, while he was on\nprobation and after he obtained the drug evaluation indicate a very recent history of\nignoring the potential consequences of the illegal use of marijuana. While Applicant\u2019s work\nand lifestyle have recently changed, he still, on occasion, visits with friends who continue\nto abuse marijuana. Having considered all potential mitigating conditions, I conclude that\nthe above factors preclude finding that any mitigating condition applies. \n\n5\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness; and, by its very nature, calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \nApplicant illegally used marijuana from January 2002 until November 26, 2008. He\nwas convicted of possession of marijuana and placed on six months probation in or before\nOctober 2008. His use of marijuana on November 26, 2008, was in violation of a term of\nhis probation. DC 31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; 31(c): allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted; and 31(e): violation of parole or probation. . . apply.    \nApplicant abused marijuana for over seven years and as recently as less than seven\nmonths ago. Although he has asserted he will never use marijuana again, he still, at least\non occasion, associates with friends who abuse marijuana. His recent history of drug\nabuse and the circumstances under which the most recent use occurred, as described\nabove, preclude application of any mitigating condition. \nI have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, including Applicant\u2019s age, his educational and work history, the period of time that\nhas elapsed since his last reported use of marijuana, the whole person concept, the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying conditions.\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns caused by his abuse of a controlled\nsubstance and the criminal conduct issues that arise therefrom. He has not overcome the\ncase against him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has failed to mitigate security concerns pertaining to alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct. Clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on June 8, 2008. On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines G (alcohol consumption) and J (criminal conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 21, 2009. He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 5, 2009, which was received at DOHA on May 11, 2009. \nApplicant elected to have his case decided at a hearing. Department Counsel was \nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nprepared to proceed on July 14, 2009. On July 16, 2009, the case was assigned to me. \nOn July 28, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for August 26, \n2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which \nwere received without objection, and he testified on his behalf. I held the record open \nuntil September 4, 2009 to afford the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \nmaterial. Applicant did not submit any additional material. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on September 1, 2009. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nDepartment Counsel stated that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.d. were duplicate allegations \nand as such, he would not be going forward with evidence with regard to SOR \u00b6 1.d. Tr. \n8-9.  Department Counsel moved to substitute the correct city where Applicant\u2019s June \n2007 Driving Under the Influence (DUI) arrest occurred as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nWithout objection from the Applicant, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. Tr. 28-31. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 \n1.c., and 1.f. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.e. After Department Counsel moved to \namend SOR \u00b6 1.e. to reflect the correct city, Applicant changed his response from \ndenial to admission to SOR \u00b6 1.e. After a thorough review of the record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old financial analyst, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since May 2008. GE 1, Tr. 13-14. He is a first-time applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. Tr. 17-18.  \n \nApplicant was awarded a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Economics in \nDecember 2002. He recently completed his first class towards a Master\u2019s in Business \nAdministration. Tr. 13-16, GE 1. \n \nApplicant married in September 2005, and has a two-year-old son. Applicant \nmoved out of state to begin his current job and planned for his wife and son to join him. \nIn mid-2008, Applicant\u2019s wife informed him that she would not be joining him, and they \nhave been separated since that time. Tr. 16-17, 46-47, GE 1.  \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nThe facts are not in dispute. Applicant has a history of episodic alcohol abuse. \nHe has a history of consuming alcohol to excess and to the point of intoxication \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbeginning in high school around 1992, and continuing to at least December 2008. \nAdditionally, Applicant has a history of four alcohol-related arrests.  \n \nHis first arrest was in March 2001, and he was charged with DUI. He pled guilty \nto the lesser charge of Reckless Driving and was fined. His second arrest was in June \n2002, and he was charged with DUI/Drugs/Toxic Vapors/or Combination, DUI with a \nBAC of .08 or more, and Speed Greater Than Reasonable and Prudent. He pled guilty \nto DUI/Drugs/Toxic Vapors/or Combination, and the remaining charges were dismissed. \nHe was sentenced to 24 hours in jail and ordered to attend 16 hours of alcohol \nawareness training. \n \nHis third arrest was in June 2007, and he was charged with DUI with a BAC of \n.17. He was found guilty and sentenced to four days in jail, mandatory alcohol \nawareness training, and fined. His fourth arrest was in September 2008 and he was \ncharged with DUI. The charge is still pending with a court date in December 2009. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.f.) Tr. 11-12, 23-36, GE 2 \u2013 GE 5. \n \nApplicant attended an intensive outpatient alcohol treatment on a voluntary basis \nfrom October 2008 to November 2008. He relapsed and resumed drinking \u201caround New \nYears of 2009.\u201d Tr. 36-38, GE 2. Applicant was fully aware that he had a drinking \nproblem and enrolled in an inpatient alcohol treatment program from July 17, 2009 to \nAugust 14, 2009. He stopped drinking on July 16, 2009, the day before he entered the \nprogram. Applicant\u2019s aftercare program consists of attending seven AA meetings per \nweek for three months. He was also prescribed Celexa for depression. As of the hearing \ndate, Applicant had been sober a total of 12 days. Tr. 39-45, 49-53, AE A. \n \nDuring an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview on August 5, 2008, \nApplicant stated that he did not intend to drink again as his responsibilities had \nchanged. At his hearing, Applicant added regarding his commitment to stop drinking, \u201cI \ncan say one day at a time, I can\u2019t tell you what to think. I can\u2019t say anything to that \neffect, but I know that I\u2019m going to do this. I don\u2019t have any other options.\u201d Tr. 45, GE 2. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nThe four alcohol-related arrests supra have been cross-alleged under this \nconcern. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) The discussion under Alcohol Consumption supra is incorporated \nby reference under this section. \n \nCharacter Evidence  \n \nApplicant has been working in the defense industry since 2003. Tr. 48. He shares \na house with a co-worker, who holds a top secret clearance, who does not drink. \nApplicant spends his discretionary free time going to the gym. Tr. 54-55. His counselor \nfrom his inpatient treatment program submitted a favorable reference letter. He \ndescribed Applicant as being \u201cengaged fully in both group and individual therapy \nthoroughly addressing issues of guilt, remorse, personal responsibility et al.\u201d The \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncounselor added that Applicant completed treatment and was discharged WSA (With \nStaff Approval). AE B. \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n  \nUnder Guideline G (alcohol consumption), the government\u2019s concern is that \nexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. \n \n \nThe government established its case under Guideline G through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the evidence presented. In addition to a history of consuming alcohol to \nexcess from 1992 to 2009, Applicant had four separate DUI arrests in 2001, 2002, \n2007, and 2008.   \n \n \nA review of the evidence supports application of two alcohol consumption \ndisqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6 22(a): \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as \ndriving while under the influence,\u201d applies because of his four alcohol-related arrests. \nAG \u00b6 22(c): \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent,\u201d applies because of his 17-year history of alcohol consumption to excess. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, the evidence does not \nwarrant application of any of the four alcohol consumption mitigating conditions. A brief \ndiscussion of three potentially applicable mitigating conditions follows. AG \u00b6 23(a) states \n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s alcohol \nconsumption problems have been ongoing from 1992 to 2009, a period of 17 years.  \nAG \u00b6 23(b) states \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser).\u201d As of his hearing date, Applicant had been sober 12 days since being \ndischarged from an inpatient treatment program. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d) stated \u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or \noutpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of \nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis \nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u201d Again, Applicant was only able to \nestablish a 12-day period of alcohol abstinence as of his hearing date.  \n \nIt is clear that Applicant wants to overcome his alcohol consumption problems. \nHe deserves credit for recognizing that he has a problem and seeking the necessary \nhelp. Time will tell whether the recent inpatient program Applicant attended will result in \nhis achieving long-term sobriety. At his hearing, Applicant acknowledged the problems \nthe misuse of alcohol has caused him, demonstrated remorse, and a steadfast \ncommitment to continue lifestyle changes consistent with abstinence from alcohol.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J (criminal conduct), the government\u2019s concern is that criminal \nactivity \ncreates \ndoubt \nabout \na \nperson\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \nand \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe government established its case under Guideline J through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the evidence presented. Applicant had four separate DUI arrests in \n2001, 2002, 2007, and 2008.  \n \n \nA review of the evidence supports application of two criminal conduct \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 31(a): \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses;\u201d and AG \u00b6 32(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted \nor convicted,\u201d for reasons discussed supra. \n \n \nAfter reviewing the five criminal conduct mitigating conditions, I find \nnone of them are applicable, again for reasons discussed supra. \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant has been struggling with his alcohol consumption problems his entire \nadult life. It has taken a severe toll on him, both personally and professionally. No one \nknows this more than Applicant. While he is to be commended for seeking alcohol \ntreatment on his own volition, 12 days of sobriety does not establish a sufficient track \nrecord. I do believe Applicant demonstrated a sincere desire to overcome his alcohol \nconsumption problems. However, Applicant must demonstrate that he has gained the \nupper hand on remaining alcohol-free over a period of time.    \n \nTo conclude, Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence to explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant has not met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. I take this position based \non the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \n\u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and supporting evidence, my \napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my \ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e. \u2013 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 26, \n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 14, 2009. The Government \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \noffered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted Exhibits A through O, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on July 23, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 9, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He has one child with his wife. He has two children with \nhis former girlfriend, with whom he lived from 1999 to 2005. He works for a defense \ncontractor as a supply technician. His employee evaluations rate him as exceeding \nexpectations in almost all categories. Applicant submitted two service awards and one \ncertificate of appreciation to demonstrate his work ethic. He also tendered two character \nstatements describing Applicant as an asset to his employer, being a dedicated and \nhard-working employee.  His security officer knows of the 2006 criminal situation. (Tr. \n34, 38, 42, 43; Exhibits 1, L to O) \n \n \nThe state police received a report that Applicant had engaged in sexual activity \nwith a minor female.  On March 3, 2006, the state police obtained a search warrant for \nApplicant\u2019s home seeking 19 categories of evidence pertaining to the alleged crimes.  \nThe search warrant was supported by an affidavit from the police officer that he \nreceived information from child protective services agent about the alleged crimes.  \nApplicant\u2019s home was searched and evidence was found.  His computer was seized for \nanalysis. Applicant was indicted on May 18, 2006, for third degree sodomy on or about \nJanuary 7-8, 2006. He was also indicted at the same time for third degree rape \nallegedly occurring on or about January 12 to 16, 2006. Both charges are felonies under \nthe state law of Applicant\u2019s residence. In both incidents Applicant was 28 years old, and \nhis sexual partner was a 14-year-old female, the sister of his girlfriend who was the \nmother of his two children. Bail was set at $10,000.  Applicant turned himself into the \npolice. (Tr. 67; Exhibits 2, 3, D) \n \n \nOn June 12, 2008, Applicant entered an agreement with the state prosecutor, \nagreeing to a procedure under state law known as a pretrial diversion of a class D \nfelony. The felony charges were reduced to misdemeanors and listed as \u201csexual \nmisconduct (acts).\u201d Applicant had the assistance and advice of an attorney before he \nentered this agreement. Applicant entered an \u201cAlford\u201d plea, not admitting guilt but \nacknowledging that the evidence available to the state strongly indicated Applicant\u2019s \nguilt, and that it was in his best interest to enter the agreement.  Applicant was placed \non 24 months of unsupervised diversion, subject to the conditions further imposed by \nthe Probation and Parole Division, and ordered not to commit any other offenses.  \nApplicant shall remain free of drug and alcohol consumption during the 24 months \nsubject to random testing. Court costs of $150 were also assessed. Applicant will not \ncomplete his 24 months of diversion until June 2010. At the successful conclusion of the \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndiversion, Applicant will have the charges \u201cdesignated as Dismissed-Diverted\u201d under \nstate law. (Tr. 47-53; Exhibits 4 and K) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that the information he gave the government investigator \nabout these events on October 3, 2006, was accurate.  He stated in the interrogatory \nanswer that \u201cThe case is over and I have forwarded the dismissal paperwork to the \nsecurity office.\u201d Applicant further agreed in the interrogatory answer that his statement \nmight be admitted into evidence at a hearing to determine security clearance eligibility. \n(Tr. 73; Exhibit 5) \n \n \nApplicant repeatedly stated during the hearing that the case \u201cwould be in a \npending status until a certain date and then would go into dismissal.\u201d He denied \ncommitting the specific sexual acts alleged in the affidavit and the indictment. His \nreason for accepting the diversion was to keep joint custody of his two children.  \nApplicant believes the allegations arose because he tried to obtain a protective order \nagainst his girlfriend in February 2006 after his children were exposed to a fight among \nhis girlfriend\u2019s family members.  The state court judge denied Applicant\u2019s petition for a \nprotective order on February 28, 2006. (Tr. 35, 45, 48, 49, 53-59; Exhibits A, B)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanations of why he entered the diversion agreement while \ncontinuing to deny his sexual acts with a 14-year-old female are not credible or \npersuasive.  His rote repetition of his reason for the agreement diminishes his credibility \nfurther. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \n\n \n4 \n \n \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes five conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.  Three conditions may apply to Applicant: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable \nconditions ; \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; and \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program. \n \n \nApplicant was indicted on two felony charges, one of sodomy and the other of \nrape. His sexual actions were with a 14-year-old partner, the sister of his girlfriend. He \npled guilty under an agreement with the state prosecutor, and received 24 months \ndiversion under state law. If Applicant commits no other offenses during the diversion \nterm ending June 2010, the charges will be dismissed under the diversion procedure. \nApplicant denies he had sexual relations with the 14-year-old female. After accepting \nthe diversion agreement and making an \u201cAlford\u201d plea, he cannot now claim he did not \ncommit the acts to which he pled guilty, merely for the purpose of obtaining a security \nclearance. He is collaterally estopped from doing so. AG \u00b6 31 (a), (c), and (d) apply \nunder these facts.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  One \ncondition may apply to Applicant to some extent: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n  \n \nApplicant has not committed any other offenses since March 2006. His \nemployment record is good. However, his statements and attitude at the hearing, \ndenying that he committed the alleged acts, demonstrate his lack of remorse or \ncontrition for his actions. His explanations for his actions are not credible. AG \u00b6 32 (d) \nhas limited applicability.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The evidence overwhelmingly \nproves that Applicant engaged in sexual acts with a 14-year-old female. These were \nserious criminal actions. Applicant accepted a diversion plea agreement with the state \nafter consulting with legal counsel of his choosing. His actions, sexual and legal, were \nvoluntary.  He was 28-years old at the time he committed the criminal acts.  He has not \nshown remorse or sufficient rehabilitation. The potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress exists because of the nature of these offenses, even though his \nsecurity manager and family know of the allegations.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his Guideline J, \nCriminal Conduct. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked for a year and a half as a performance enhancement specialist. In his answer to the SOR, he denied all but one of the allegations, which he admitted with an explanation. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact. Applicant was a national-level athlete until an injury during his sophomore year of college ended his ability to compete. After graduation from college, he attended graduate school and obtained a master\u2019s degree in sports psychology. In early 2004, he started a \u201cpeak performance counseling\u201d business focusing on elite endurance athletes. He was also working as a salesman in a bicycle store at the time. He stopped working at the store in April 2005, and continued his consulting business until November 2006.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owed more than $28,000, in five delinquent credit card debts and one\ndelinquent utility bill, before starting his present job. He has resolved all debts allocated\nto him in his recent divorce decree, and has sufficient means to resolve the three\nallocated to his former wife if she does not do so. Based upon a thorough review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on June 2, 2008. On February 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security\nconcerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1,\nJuly 31, 2009\n\n2\n2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 13, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing (AR) on March 26, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 20, 2009,\nand DOHA assigned the case to me on April 30, 2009.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 1, 2009, setting the hearing for June\n22, 2009. On June 11, 2009, I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a continuance until July 7,\n2009, and DOHA issued an Amended Notice of Hearing reflecting the new date. I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on July 7, 2009. Department Counsel offered\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A which was\nalso admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nJuly 15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked\nfor a year and a half as a performance enhancement specialist. In his answer to the\nSOR, he denied all but one of the allegations, which he admitted with an explanation.\nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact.\nApplicant was a national-level athlete until an injury during his sophomore year of\ncollege ended his ability to compete. After graduation from college, he attended\ngraduate school and obtained a master\u2019s degree in sports psychology. In early 2004, he\nstarted a \u201cpeak performance counseling\u201d business focusing on elite endurance athletes.\nHe was also working as a salesman in a bicycle store at the time. He stopped working\nat the store in April 2005, and continued his consulting business until November 2006.\nHe also worked on a university staff from February 2006 to November 2007, when he\nobtained his current position. (GE 1 at 6-16; Tr. at 33-36.)\nApplicant and his former wife were married in August 2001. She worked as an\ninterior designer until she was laid off from three different jobs in 2005 and 2006. With\nthe collapse of the real estate market, that hit early and hard in the city where they lived,\nshe was unable to find work. However, they continued spending more than Applicant\nwas earning through use of their joint credit cards, resulting in the debts alleged in the\nSOR. They separated in February 2007, and filed for divorce which was finalized March\n20, 2009. (AR at 1-3, 12-14.)\nIn the marital settlement agreement (MSA) approved by the court in its final\ndecree, Applicant and his former wife were each assigned sole responsibility for some\nof their joint debts. Of those listed in the SOR, Applicant was responsible for the debts\nalleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. (Note: the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f reflect\na duplicate listing of the same debt to the original creditor and a collection agency.) He\nwas also responsible for two credit card debts not listed in the SOR. On April 30, 2009,\nhe made his final payment to resolve the last of all those debts after negotiating\nsettlements with each of the creditors. (AR; AE A; Tr. at 42-47.) \n\n3\nThe only remaining delinquent debts for which Applicant bears some liability are\nlisted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. The court assigned responsibility for resolving these\ndebts to Applicant\u2019s former wife through the MSA. He has contacted each of the\ncreditors to notify them of this fact, and authorized them to deal directly with his former\nwife to arrange resolution. He has also given her all the account information and points\nof contact so she can deal with the creditors. She has not reported any progress to him,\nand he is not aware of her current employment or financial situation. The last he heard\nwas on April 22, 2009, when she acknowledged the information and agreed to start\naddressing the debts. Applicant realizes that the MSA does not sever his contractual\nliability for the formerly joint debts to the creditors. He was advised by his attorneys,\nhowever, that he had to give his former wife a chance to fulfill her agreed obligations\nbefore he takes action to resolve them. The MSA contains a provision under which he\nwould have to give her written notice seven days before making payment toward any of\nthose debts, during which time she could object. If he does make the payments, she\nwould then become liable to him for the amounts paid plus interest. (AE A at 16-17; AR,\nMSA at 8-9; Tr. at 47-49, 62-63, 81.)\nApplicant has almost $1,700 per month in surplus income after living expenses\nand payments toward his student loans. He has laid out a plan under which he can\neasily afford to resolve the three remaining delinquent debts if his former wife does not,\nand intends to follow that plan if necessary. He informed his supervisors about his\nfinancial situation when first hired, and has kept them informed as he repaid each of his\nobligations. (AE A at 17-19; Tr. at 41, 49-51, 82-85.) \nApplicant\u2019s former and present supervisors (one a retired Army colonel) wrote\nextremely complimentary letters describing his good character, responsibility, and\nprofessionalism. His work performance has been exemplary, resulting in several raises\nand awards and his selection as interim site manager. He has made substantial\ncontributions to Army mission accomplishment. The retired colonel selected him to\nserve as his replacement as the site manager in charge of their program at a major\nArmy facility. The other eight site managers under this contract around the country all\nhave between 15-20 years experience in Army leadership positions. (AE A at 18-19; Tr.\nat 35-41.)\nApplicant exhibited a thorough understanding of his financial situation and a firm\ncommitment to follow through, if necessary and with his attorneys\u2019 advice, to resolve the\nthree remaining credit card debts for which his former wife assumed primary\nresponsibility. He is well educated, is dedicated to performing his job with excellence,\nand is now financially in a comfortable position to repay those debts if his former wife\ndoes not. I found him to be credible and sincere in all respects.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider and apply the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\n\n4\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that: \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded in mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n5\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel asserted the applicability of two of these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d (Tr. at 76.) Before obtaining his current job,\nApplicant and his wife suffered through a period, in 2005 and 2006, when his earnings\nwere insufficient to fund all family expenses after she involuntarily lost three different\njobs and could not find work. As a result, they accumulated more than $28,000 in SOR-\nlisted delinquent debts. Their March 2009 divorce decree and MSA allocated primary\nresponsibility for three of these debts (totaling about $22,000 as alleged in the SOR) to\nhis wife. With his substantially improved income from his current job, Applicant has fully\nresolved all his other delinquent and credit card debts over the past year. He provided\nhis former wife with all the information and authority necessary for her to meet her\nobligation to resolve the remaining three debts. Applicant has both the means and the\nintention to promptly resolve them if she does not do so within a reasonable period.\nThus, while his financial inability to pay some debts two years ago supported security\nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19(a), his demonstrated present ability and willingness to resolve\nthose debts no longer supports such concerns. He is under no financial duress at\npresent, so is not at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The\nevidence established a relatively brief and minor history of not meeting some financial\nobligations that supports security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(c), however. Whether this\nhistory indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, or otherwise raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information must be determined.  \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from\nfinancial considerations. The potentially applicable mitigating conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n6\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (b) provide mitigation because Applicant\u2019s delinquencies arose\nwhile he was trying to start his own consulting business and his wife involuntarily lost\nher employment and ability to contribute toward family living expenses. Applicant acted\nresponsibly, and demonstrated his current reliability and trustworthiness, by ending the\nmarriage and obtaining a far-better-paying job to pay off his debts. Applicant has fully\nrepaid all formerly delinquent and credit card debts for which he assumed responsibility\nunder his MSA decree, and is following his attorneys\u2019 advice concerning the timing of\nhis intervention to pay those debts for which his ex-wife is primarily responsible.\nSubstantial mitigation is accordingly established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d). Finally,\nApplicant did not dispute the underlying legitimacy of the three remaining credit card\ndebts, but did demonstrate his ex-wife\u2019s primary obligation to repay them and hold him\nharmless. By analogy, this supports partial application of AG \u00b6 20(e) in mitigation of his\ndecision to delay resolution of these debts with his own funds until she has time to\ndemonstrate her inability or unwillingness to fulfill her agreed obligations. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n\n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involves a period of several years when he and his former wife struggled\nfinancially while he tried to start a consulting business and she lost her job several\ntimes. Applicant completely removed himself from those circumstances, obtained a\nbetter-paying job, and has resolved all the debts for which he was primarily responsible.\nHe is willing and able to resolve the three remaining debts for which his ex-wife\nassumed primary responsibility should she fail to do so within a reasonable period. \nApplicant is fully mature, responsible, and has impressed his supervisors to the\npoint they have elevated him to a responsible management position normally requiring\nsignificantly more experience. His financial circumstances now permit him substantial\nsavings of surplus income each month, and there is minimal potential for any pressure,\ncoercion, or duress from his three remaining debts. This improved income, and his\ndemonstrated understanding of his budget and his need to fulfill financial obligations\nmake continuation or recurrence of financial problems very unlikely. \u201cAn applicant is not\nrequired to show that [he] has completely paid off [his] indebtedness, only that [he] has\nestablished a reasonable plan to resolve [his] debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to\nimplement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting\nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006)).\nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate security\nconcerns arising from his relatively brief and minor history of failure to meet some\nfinancial obligations, and his former inability to pay some debts. The record evidence\nsupports complete confidence as to his present eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance. For all these reasons, Applicant has mitigated security concerns related to\nhis financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 13, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On March 11, 2010, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge David M. White denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge did not consider evidence\nfavorable to Applicant; whether the Judge erred in the application of the pertinent mitigating\nconditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a\nDefense contractor.  He is married to his fourth wife, with six children living with him and four\nothers living elsewhere.\nIn 2001 Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.  His debts were discharged later\nthat year.  Applicant\u2019s third wife had a substance abuse problem and spent so much money on her\naddictions that Applicant was reduced to relying on credit cards and loans to fund the ordinary\nexpenses of life.  \nHe bought a house in 2005, financing the purchase with a mortgage.  He took out a second\nmortgage on the house two years later.  Applicant has defaulted on his multiple credit card debts and\nhis mortgage payments.  \u201cBy September 2008, the outstanding balance on the second mortgage was\n$107,658, and the home was in foreclosure.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Although these debts were in\nApplicant\u2019s name only, his third wife had access to his funds.  In August 2009, Applicant and his\ncurrent wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.  \nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge explained why he concluded that Applicant\nhad failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation, He stated in part: \nApplicant failed to demonstrate financial rehabilitation or evidence of solvency from\nthe present time forward, so recurrence and worsening of his financial concerns were\nnot shown to be unlikely.  He continues to bear financial obligations for significant\npast debt and ongoing living expenses.  He accordingly remains subject to pressure,\nexploitation, or duress.  The record contains insufficient other evidence about his\ncharacter, trustworthiness, or responsibility to mitigate these concerns.  Decision at\n6. \nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to consider favorable evidence, submitting in\nsupport of this contention documents to the effect that he had been discharged in Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in late 2009.  However, this evidence was not included in the record and, indeed, the\n\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes an attachment dated December 22, 2009, some two months after the close of the\n1\nrecord.  The Judge had already accepted a submission dated October 27, 2009.  On appeal Applicant asserts that the\nOctober 27, 2009, submission was timely because he had called Department Counsel to seek an extension and that\nsomeone from Department Counsel\u2019s office called him back and granted the extension.  The Board has neither the\nauthority nor the resources to confirm this assertion.  In any case, it is the Judge, not the opposing party, who authorizes\nan extension in a Hearing Office proceeding.\nSee Decision at 2: \u201cThe record contains insufficient information about the circumstances that led Applicant\n2\nto seek bankruptcy relief in 2001 to support findings about its causes or reasonableness.\u201d  Applicant contends that the\nJudge ignored information in his security clearance application regarding this bankruptcy.  See Item 5, Security Clearance\nApplication, at 19.  However, the information in Item 5 is not sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s statement.\n3\nbankruptcy discharge occurred after the close of the record.   We cannot consider new evidence on\n1\nappeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal\nBoard\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-06518\nat 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).  In this case, the Judge properly decided the case on the basis of the\nrecord before him.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not properly evaluate his mitigating evidence, for\nexample his third wife\u2019s effect on his finances and his prior bankruptcy discharge in 2001, including\nhis subsequent efforts to repair his credit.  However, the record demonstrates that the Judge explicitly\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  The Judge stated that there was little evidence in the\nrecord explaining the circumstances underlying his first bankruptcy discharge.   He also stated that,\n2\ndespite evidence as to the third wife\u2019s addictions, Applicant had failed to demonstrate that his\ndelinquent debts arose due to circumstances outside his control or that he had acted responsibly in\nregard to his debts.  \nThe record does not support a conclusion that the Judge mis-weighed evidence.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009); ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007) (A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to\nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed\nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.)\nNeither does it support a conclusion that the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions was\nerroneous.   \n \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant accrued 15 delinquent debts totaling over $26,000, in addition to more\nthan $237,000 in delinquent first and second mortgage loans that are in foreclosure\nproceedings. This followed his 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. He demonstrated\nno effort to resolve any of these debts except a very recent filing of another Chapter 7\nbankruptcy petition, and provided no evidence to establish ongoing solvency or\notherwise mitigate financial security concerns. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on May 25, 2005.1\nOn July 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\n2\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nMarch 11, 2010\n\nItem 4.\n3\nThe Government submitted ten Items in support of the SOR allegations.\n4\nItem 5 at 1, 5-6, 13-14, 18; AFR at 3.\n5\nItem 7; Item 5 at 7-10.\n6\n2\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 4, 2009, and requested that his\ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.3\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on September 9, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n4\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non September 14, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. He submitted further evidence and\ncomments in response to the FORM on October 27, 2009, well past the October 14,\n2009, deadline, and expressed some objections to the accuracy of Department\nCounsel\u2019s factual assertions. Department Counsel received Applicant\u2019s FORM response\n(AFR) on November 2, 2009, and included it in the record with a memorandum of the\nsame date in which he expressed no objection to its consideration despite its\nuntimeliness. I received the case assignment on November 12, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he began\nworking in November 2004. He has no military service, and this is his first application for\na security clearance. He is married for the fourth time, with six children now living with\nhim, and four others who live elsewhere.  In his response to the SOR, he formally\n5\nadmitted each allegation. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including his responses to the SOR\nand FORM, and to DOHA interrogatories, are incorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in March 2001, with $87,767 in\ntotal liabilities. The proceedings resulted in discharge of his debts in July 2001, the\nsame month his second divorce became final and two months before his third marriage.\nThe record contains insufficient information about the circumstances that led Applicant\nto seek bankruptcy relief in 2001 to support findings about its causes or\nreasonableness. His SF 86 reflected continuous employment from 1990 to the time the\nbankruptcy was filed, with the exception of five months of unemployment from April to\nSeptember 2000.  \n6\n\nItem 4 at 4-5; Item 6 at 3-7; Item 8 at 4, 12; AFR at 4.\n7\nItem 4 at 4-5; Item 10; AFR at 4-5.\n8\nDepartment Counsel cites Item 6 as the source of his comments about Applicant\u2019s Personal Financial\n9\nStatement at page 7 of the FORM. That information was not included in Item 6 or elsewhere.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s third wife had a severe substance abuse problem. She spent so\nmuch money supporting her addictions that Applicant had to use credit cards and loans\nthat he could not afford to repay in order to keep the family fed and housed. He\npurchased a home with a $232,000 mortgage loan in April 2005. In May 2007, he took\nout a second mortgage loan for $95,700. In October and November 2007, he began\ndefaulting on his multiple credit card and mortgage debts. Not including his mortgage\nloans, he had 15 delinquent debts totaling $26,034, as listed in the SOR. All of these\ndebts were incurred in his name only, but his wife had access to the funds. By\nSeptember 2008, the outstanding balance on the second mortgage was $107,658, and\nthe home was in foreclosure.  \n7\nApplicant offered no evidence of payment toward, or other attempt to resolve,\nany of these debts. In August 2009, he and his fourth wife filed his second Chapter 7\nbankruptcy proceeding. Although he provided no schedules or other documentation\nconcerning which debts he is seeking to discharge, the bankruptcy would presumably\ncover all of the SOR-listed debt, as well as thousands of dollars Applicant said that he\nowes in legal and other professional fees as a result of his third divorce proceedings.  \n8\nThe record contains no evidence about Applicant\u2019s current income, living\nexpenses, or ability to resolve his delinquent debts and avoid incurring additional ones.9\nHe provided no evidence concerning the quality of his recent professional performance,\nthe level of responsibility his duties entail, or his track record with respect to handling\nsensitive information and observation of security procedures. He submitted no character\nreferences or other evidence tending to establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or\nreliability. I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person\nsince he elected to have his case decided without a hearing.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\n\n4\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nDepartment Counsel argued that the evidence established security concerns\nunder three Guideline F DCs, as set forth in AG \u00b6 19: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to\n\nFORM at 6.\n10\n5\nsatisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic\nplan to pay the debt;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  Applicant\n10\nhas been unwilling or unable to satisfy any of his SOR-listed delinquent debts since late\n2007, and failed to provide any evidence of his willingness or ability to do so in the\nfuture. DC 19(a) is clearly established. He has demonstrated a long history of not\nmeeting financial obligations dating back to his first bankruptcy, including a failure to\naddress any of his delinquencies after becoming aware of the security concerns raised\nby such conduct. Security concerns under DC 19(c) are also supported on this record.\nHowever, this record contains no evidence to establish that Applicant\u2019s debts were\ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending on his part. The evidence indicates that\nhis third wife\u2019s substance abuse was the principal source of his financial problems over\nthe past three or four years. To the extent he participated in that arrangement while\ntrying to make their marriage succeed, he is responsible for the debts he incurred. His\nactions in that regard have not been shown to be frivolous, however. Accordingly, DC\n19(b) is not supported by the evidence.\nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. Under MC 20(a), disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility is recent, involves numerous creditors, and\ncontinues to date. He remains substantially in debt, and he provided no evidence\nconcerning his current financial situation that would support a finding that delinquent\nindebtedness is unlikely to recur. The evidence does not support application of this\npotentially mitigating condition. \nUnder MC 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant has worked\ncontinuously in his current position over the past five years, but his only effort to\naddress any of these delinquencies is to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief for the\nsecond time in nine years. He offered no evidence that any debt was incurred due to\ncauses beyond his control. Although his income funded his third wife\u2019s substance\nabuse, he originated each SOR-listed debt in only his name. He also did not\ndemonstrate that he responsibly reduced non-essential spending in reaction to his\nmounting debts. Applicant did not establish mitigation of his presently delinquent debts,\nor of his financial history as a whole, under this provision.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under MC 20(c). Similarly, MC 20(d) applies where the evidence\n\n6\nshows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\u201d Applicant established minimal mitigation under these two provisions\nbecause he offered no evidence of financial counseling, and failed to address any\ndelinquency other than filing for bankruptcy after responding to the SOR. Moreover, the\nabsence of evidence demonstrating his current solvency or ability to resolve his\noutstanding delinquencies precludes findings of \u201cclear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control,\u201d or \u201ca good-faith effort.\u201d Insufficient evidence was\npresented to alleviate the substantial security concerns raised by the length and degree\nof financial irresponsibility that continues to date. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature\nindividual who is responsible for his voluntary choices and conduct that underlie the\nsecurity concerns expressed in the SOR. He established a consistent pattern of\nfinancial irresponsibility dating back at least nine years, with no evidence of any efforts\nto resolve his outstanding obligations other than seeking to be excused from meeting\nhis freely assumed financial obligations for a second time in that period. \nApplicant failed to demonstrate financial rehabilitation or evidence of solvency\nfrom the present time forward, so recurrence and worsening of his financial concerns\nwere not shown to be unlikely. He continues to bear financial obligations for significant\npast debt and ongoing living expenses. He accordingly remains subject to pressure,\nexploitation, or duress. The record contains insufficient other evidence about his\ncharacter, trustworthiness, or responsibility to mitigate these concerns. \n\n7\nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On March 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Item1) detailing the trustworthiness\nconcerns under Guidelines C, B, and H for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of\nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on April 27, 2009 (Item 2), in\nwhich he requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn July 15, 2009, Department Counsel issued the Department's written case. A\ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on\n\n2\nJuly 16, 2009, and in the FORM, Department Counsel offered nine documentary\nexhibits (Items 1-9). Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on September 27,\n2009. Applicant submitted no additional response. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on December 4, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access\nto sensitive information is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nrelating to the country of Lebanon. The request and the attached documents were\nadmitted into evidence as Item 9. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR (Item 2) Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations under\nGuidelines C, B, and H, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record,\nincluding the  FORM, Applicant's RSOR, and the other admitted documents, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 28 years old. He seeks to occupy an Information Systems\nPosition, designated ADP-I/II/III to support a defense contractor. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nThe SOR lists four allegations, regarding Foreign Preference, under\nAdjudicative Guideline C. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as\nthey were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with\nLebanon and the United States. In his RSOR, Applicant stated that he was born in\nLebanon, to a Lebanese father and an American mother. SOR allegations 1.b. through\nd., which are examples of the exercise of Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship, will be reviewed\nbelow. \n1.b. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant possesses a current Lebanon \npassport, which will not expire until June 18, 2009.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted\nthat this is correct. \n1.c. Applicant conceded in his RSOR that he has used his Lebanese\npassport to travel to Lebanon, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n3\n1.d.  Applicant also conceded in his RSOR that he intends to renew his\nLebanese  passport, \u201cbecause doing so facilitates entry into the country by bypassing\nthe need for a visa.\u201d He also wrote in Item 2, \u201cThere is also a possibility that I may move\nback to Lebanon in the future to be closer to my family and my Lebanese citizenship\nwould facilitate that immensely.\u201d\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe SOR lists five allegations, regarding Foreign Influence, under\nAdjudicative Guideline B, which will also be reviewed in the same order as they were\nlisted on the SOR. Again, Applicant has admitted all of the allegations listed under\nparagraph 2:\n \n2.a. Applicant's father is a citizen and resident of Lebanon.\n2.b. Applicant's step-mother is a citizen and resident of Lebanon.\n2.c. Applicant attended college in Lebanon from 1999 to 2003. \n2.d. Applicant was employed in Lebanon for three different periods of time;\nMay 2001 to February 2002, June 2003 to December 2003, and March 2004 to August\n2005. \n2.e. Applicant has traveled to Lebanon, at least once a year, since he has\nlived in the United States, covering the years 2006 until at least 2009. As reviewed\nabove, he has used his Lebanese passport for each trip that he has made to Lebanon. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists five allegations, regarding illegal drug involvement under\nAdjudicative Guideline H:\n1.a. The SOR alleges and Applicant has admitted that he used marijuana\nfrom approximately June 2006 to at least April 2008. \n1.b. The SOR alleges and Applicant has admitted that he used hashish\nfrom approximately October 2002 to at least September 2005.\n1.c.  The SOR alleges and Applicant has admitted that he used cocaine in\napproximately January 2004 and December 2005.\n 1.d. The SOR alleges and Applicant has admitted that he used MDMA,\nalso known as Ecstacy, in about September 2005. \n1.e. The SOR alleges that Applicant would consider using drugs in the\nfuture. Applicant admitted this allegation in his RSOR, but he also stated \u201cAlthough I\nhad previously admitted to considering drug use in the future (Guideline H), sub-\nparagraph (e), I have since had a change of heart. Given the resulting questionable\n\n4\nnature of my character, it has become clear to me how destructive even recreational\nuse can be and the degree to which it could potentially compromise work opportunities\nin the future.\u201d\nCurrent Status of Lebanon\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Lebanon. Lebanon\nbecame an independent country in 1943. Its history since independence has had\nperiods of both political turmoil and prosperity. \nAlthough Lebanon is a parliamentary republic, it has human rights problems.\nAmericans have been the targets of numerous terrorist attacks in Lebanon, and the\nperpetrators of many of those attacks are still present in Lebanon and retain the ability\nto act. Furthermore, Palestinian groups hostile to the Lebanese Government and the\nUnited States operate largely autonomously inside refugee camps in Lebanon. Finally,\nHizballah, a U.S. designated \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization,\u201d has 14 elected officials in\nthe Lebanese National Assembly and is represented in the cabinet and the Labor\nMinister. \n \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a Public Trust Position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n5\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9, the security concern involving Foreign Preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s application, receipt, and continuing use of a Lebanese passport,\nraises Foreign Preference concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) 10 (a), the\nexercise of the privilege of foreign citizenship.\nSince Applicant continues to maintain his Lebanese passport, which he has used\noften in the past and plans to use in the future, and he is not willing to renounce his\nLebanese citizenship, I do not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) under this\nguideline applies to this case. After considering all of the evidence of record on\nGuideline C, I conclude that the disqualifying evidence substantially outweighs the\nmitigating evidence. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding Foreign Influence: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\n\n6\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: (a)\n\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\u201d Applicant\u2019s relatives, who are citizens and residents of Lebanon, and who\ncontinue to have, by his own admission, very close bonds to Applicant, make AG \u00b6  (a)\na concern to the Government. I find that AG \u00b6  (b) \u201cconnections to a foreign person,\ngroup government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation . . . and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information\u201d is also applicable in this case. \nI do not find that any MC is applicable to this Applicant and this case. I therefore,\nconclude Guideline B against Applicant.\n  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession and use of several\nillegal drugs for many years, especially in light of his desire to have access to the\nnation's secrets is a significant concern. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his\nillegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 (a) \u201cany drug\nabuse\u201d, and (c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution.\u201d Based on the totality of admitted evidence, including\nApplicant\u2019s conflicting statements regarding his intention to use illegal substances\nagain, I also find that AG \u00b6 25. (h) \u201cfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to\ndiscontinue drug use\u201d is applicable. \nBased on the Applicant\u2019s many years and recency of his drug usage, considered\nwith Applicant\u2019s conflicting statements about his future intention to use illegal\nsubstances, I can not conclude at this time that Applicant\u2019s conduct comes within any\nMC. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a sensitive position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n7\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsensitive position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines C, B, and H, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, as to why all of the Disqualifying Conditions\napply and none of the Mitigating Conditions are applicable, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a sensitive position, under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On October 9, 2009, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline E (personal\n2\nconduct), and Guideline D (sexual behavior).\nFebruary 4, 2010\n\nThe Government submitted ten items to support its case.\n3\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and admitted the factual allegation in \u00b6\n1.a and \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c of the SOR. He elected to have his case decided on the\nrecord in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written\ncase on December 15, 2009.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material\n3\n(FORM) on December 28, 2009, and was provided an opportunity to file objections and\nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Applicant\nsubmitted additional information in a timely manner. The case was assigned to me on\nJanuary 29, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 43 years old. He graduated from high school and attended college\nfrom September 1986 until July 1987 (Item 4). Since January 1997, Applicant has\nworked as an engineering technician for a defense contractor. He held a security\nclearance during his civilian employment, including access to Sensitive Compartmented\nInformation (SCI) (Item 6).\nFrom 1990 until April 2008, Applicant accessed an internet website to view child\npornography. He also read sexual fantasy stories involving children on the website five\nto seven times per week (Item 3). When he viewed pictures of children engaging in\nsexual activity, he masturbated (Item 7). \nOn November 7, 2007, as part of a security investigation conducted by another\nagency, Applicant was interviewed. He admitted viewing an internet website that\ncontains pictures of children between the ages of 12 and 18 engaged in intercourse,\noral sex, and anal sex (Item 5). He also admitted viewing \u201cpop up\u201d pictures of children\nengaging in sexual activities two to three times per week.  \nApplicant admitted in an interview in May 2008, that he withheld the full extent of\nhis access to the child pornography because he was afraid it would affect his job. He\noriginally stated in an April interview that he viewed the site approximately two to three\ntimes per week rather than five to seven times per week. Applicant also admitted that he\nvisited the website from 1990 not 1998. He further admitted that the child pornography\nimages did not just \u201cpop up.\u201d He accessed and opened image files to view the child\npornography. Applicant told the investigator that he enjoyed visiting the site because \u201cit\nfed into his ability to imagine himself in the stories\u201d (Item 5). He elaborated that he likes\nto pretend that he was more sexually active in high school. He has never married.\nApplicant acknowledged that he intentionally provided false information to the\ninvestigators. In August 2008, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for SCI was revoked as a result of\nthe sexual behavior and personal conduct (Item 6). He did not appeal that decision.\nIn August 2008, DoD investigators interviewed Applicant as part of his security\nclearance investigation. He stated that he began accessing the website in 2004. He\nacknowledged that he visited the site daily for 10 to 15 minutes. He explained that the\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are: (1) the nature, extent, and\n5\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n3\nwebsite had images and stories about sexual fantasies with underage girls. He visited\nthe website at home and not at work (Item 9). \nApplicant believes he suffers from depression. His elderly parents are ill. His\nsister and nephew depend on Applicant financially. He regrets his lapse in judgment. He\ndoes not intend to access any underage pornography in the future. He hopes to obtain\nmedical help for his depression in the future (Response to Form).\nApplicant acknowledged that this was not a responsible thing to do and that he\nrealized that he used poor judgment. He believes his misleading information to the\ngovernment was prompted by extreme shame and humiliation. He also feared the loss\nof his job. \nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n5\nmitigating conditions is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines must be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof a clearance. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline E (personal conduct) at AG \u00b6 15, and Guideline D (sexual behavior) at AG \u00b6\n12.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nof persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n7\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite\njudgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nSexual Behavior.\nThe security concerns about Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior, as expressed in the AG\n\u00b6 12, is that \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicated a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No\nadverse inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on\nthe sexual orientation of the individual.\u201d\nThe following disqualifications are relevant. AG \u00b6 13(a) \u201csexual behavior of a\ncriminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted\u201d is an applicable\ndisqualifying condition. Applicant viewed child pornography on a website for many\nyears. This is sexual behavior of a criminal nature. \nAG \u00b6 13(b) \u201ca pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder\u201d\nis also an applicable disqualifying condition. Applicant viewed the website five to seven\ntimes per week for many years. He deliberately sought and viewed child pornography\non the internet and masturbated as a form of sexual gratification while viewing the child\npornography. He admits enjoying it, and claims it allows him to pretend he was sexually\nactive in high school.\nAG \u00b6 13(c) \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d is an applicable disqualifying condition. Applicant\nadmits he was ashamed and humiliated by his conduct. He did not fully disclose this\nbehavior to his employer during an interview during a security investigation for fear of\nlosing his job. \nAG \u00b6 13(d) \u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of\ndiscretion or judgment\u201d is an applicable disqualifying condition. Applicant\u2019s decision to\nview the website at home reflects lack of judgment and discretion. \nAn applicant might be able to mitigate Guideline D security concerns. AG \u00b6 14(a)\n\u201cthe behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no evidence of\n\n5\nsubsequent conduct of a similar nature\u201d does not apply. Applicant was at least 20 years\nold when he began his viewing. He continued this behavior for almost 18 years.\nLikewise, AG \u00b6 14(b) \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or\nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d does not apply.\nApplicant viewed the child pornography from the 1990's until at least April 2008. He\nstated that he viewed the website five to seven times a week.\nOne mitigating condition \u2018the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion,\nexploitation, or duress,\u201d AG \u00b6 14(c) may apply. Applicant finally disclosed the full extent\nof his behavior during his May 2008 interview. The government is aware of the full\nextent of his conduct. However, it does not fully apply because members of his family or\ncoworkers are not aware of this behavior.\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by Guideline D (Sexual\nBehavior) given the recency and long term adult criminal sexual misbehavior.\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in the\nAG \u00b6 15, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2 available information requires consideration of the disqualifying\nconditions listed in AG \u00b6 16(b) \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator security official, competent\ngovernment representative\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of\ninformation about ones\u2019 conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d Applicant admitted that he\nintentionally misled an investigator during an interview by not fully disclosing the exact\nyears and frequency of his viewing child pornography on the internet. He gave another\nversion in a later interview in August 2008, and minimized his conduct by stating that he\nbegan accessing the site in 2004. Certainly his behavior and concealment of such would\naffect his professional and community standing. His questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor and admitted actions casts doubt on his trustworthiness.\nThe mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d does not apply. Applicant\nadmitted that he last viewed an internet site containing child pornography in April 2008.\nHowever, he previously lied about the exact dates of his viewing. AG \u00b6 17(d) \u201cthe\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur\u201d does not apply for the reasons given above. Applicant has\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n6\nnot obtained any counseling, although he believes he may do so in the future. AG \u00b6\n17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability, to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts\u201d is not a\nmitigating condition due to the fact that Applicant only provided further and more truthful\ninformation during a third interview with the other agency investigators. In his 2008\ninterview with DoD investigators, Applicant again minimized his involvement by stating\nthat he began viewing sites in 2004.  \nFor the same reasons described above regarding sexual behavior under\nGuideline D, Applicant has not demonstrated honesty, good judgment, or\ntrustworthiness under Guideline E to mitigate security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, for and against, under Guidelines E, and D. I have also\nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG\n2(a).  Applicant is a mature adult who held an SCI clearance since 1997. However, he\n9\nengaged in viewing child pornography from 1990's until at least April 2008. He admits\nthis happened five to seven times a week. He claimed he enjoyed the activity as it\nhelped him have a better image of his sexual self. He believes he may be depressed,\nbut has not sought any counseling.\nApplicant lied about the frequency and the time span of his conduct with\ninvestigators. He did not fully disclose the information until a third interview. He lost his\nSCI access as a result. In 2008, when speaking to DoD investigators, he changed the\ntime frame for his behavior to 2004. His poor judgment, and his minimalization of his\nbehavior when responding to the SOR, and in his 2008 interview leave me with doubts\nas to his judgment. He regrets his mistake and is sorry for the incident. The positive\ninformation about Applicant is insufficient to overcome the adverse information about his\nconduct under Guideline D and Guideline E. This raises serious doubts about his\nreliability and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s recent conduct does not mitigate the security\nconcerns under these guidelines. As protection of the national interest is paramount in\nthese determinations, my doubts must be resolved in favor of the national interest.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is denied\n                             \n                                                    \nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F on May 29, 2009. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 4, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 11, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. DOHA received the request on July 13, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared\nDecember 7, 2009\n\nAE A (Budget, 1 page); AE B (Military retirement benefits, 3 pages); AE C (Earnings statements, 6 pages);\n1\nAE D (E-mail communications, 7 pages). \nGE 1; AE B; Tr. 29-30.\n2\n2\nto proceed on August 31, 2009, and I received the case assignment on September 3,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 11, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on September 30, 2009. The government offered 14 exhibits (GE)\n1 through 10, and 12 through 14, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf. He did not submit\nany exhibits at the hearing. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nOctober 7, 2009. I held the record open until October 21, 2009, for Applicant to submit\nadditional matters.

I advised\nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the\nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice (Tr. 9.). \nEvidentiary Rulings\nApplicant objected to the admission of GE 11, a prior affidavit from Applicant, on\nthe grounds of relevance. After hearing argument from both parties, I sustained\nApplicant objection in part. Most of the information in GE 11 did not relate to the issues\nraised in this case (Tr. 24-25). Thus, this information is inadmissible.

Applicant and\nhis second wife married in 1987 and divorced in 2005. Applicant and his current wife\nmarried in 2008. Applicant has five daughters, whose ages range from 14 months to 35\nyears. His youngest daughter lives with him and his wife. He has four grandchildren.4\nIn 1988, Applicant and his second wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition\nbecause of debt from his first marriage and loss of income when she was medically\nseparated from the military because of a back injury. Applicant and his wife developed a\nrepayment plan and complied with the terms of their wage earners plan under Chapter\n13. The bankruptcy court discharged their debts on July 13, 1992.  \n5\nIn 1999, Applicant and his second wife lived in a southern state and owned a\nhouse (first house). His employer offered him a promotion and a better job opportunity\nin another state. Applicant and his second wife decided to accept the promotion and\nmove several hundred miles from their home. They also decided to rent, not sell their\nfirst house. They purchased another house (second house) in their new location. Some\nmonths after they moved, the property manager overseeing the rental of the first house\ncalled to advise that pipes had broken underneath the house and that water had\ndamaged the tenants\u2019 personal property. Applicant obtained repair estimates for\napproximately $15,000. He did not have the money to pay this repair expense and his\ninsurance company declined to pay for the repairs. His tenants also declined to pay the\nrent. He attempted to pay two mortgages, but lacked the resources to do so.6\nBecause of the problems with his first house and the resulting strain on his\nhousehold income, Applicant and his second wife filed a second Chapter 13 petition for\nbankruptcy on advice of counsel. They developed a repayment plan for their debts.\nUnder their plan, they paid $235 a month for 60 months. Shortly thereafter, Applicant\u2019s\nemployer offered him a promotion. His new job required him to move overseas for two\nyears. He and his second wife decided to accept the job offer and moved overseas.\nApplicant mailed his payments to the court from overseas. Overtime, he realized that his\npayments arrived late because the mailing time from overseas took between three and\nfourteen days. He requested to electronically mail his payment, but the court lacked the\ncapacity to receive an electronic payment. Because his payments either did not arrive or\nwere late, the court dismissed his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition for nonpayment in\n2003.7\n\nTr. 44, 98-99.\n8\nGE 12; GE 13; GE 14; Tr. 58-61.\n9\nGE 10; Tr. 42.\n10\nApplicant anticipates that his alimony payments may end soon, as he believes his former wife is co-\n11\nhabitating with someone. Litigation regarding this issue is pending. At the time of the hearing, he still paid her\nalimony.\n4\nWhen Applicant and his family moved overseas in 2000, he listed his second\nhouse for sale. It sold very quickly and he does not have any residual financial problems\nrelated to this house. He still owned the first house.8\nWhen Applicant and his family arrived overseas, they stayed in hotels until they\nfound local housing. Applicant charged these expenses on his corporate credit card and\nsubmitted vouchers for these expenses every week. He received payment for the\nvouchers three to six weeks later. Not long after the family\u2019s arrival, one daughter\nunderwent eye surgery in a local hospital to prevent blindness from a birth defect. The\nsurgery cost approximately $10,000. His medical insurance carrier through his military\nretirement refused to pay for this surgery at first. He used his voucher money to pay this\nbill. As a result, he did not pay his corporate credit card bill, which led to the suspension\nof this card. Applicant borrowed money from his father-in-law to pay this bill. He has\nrepaid his father-in-law. His medical insurance carrier did pay the surgery expenses.\nApplicant\u2019s employer reported his 2000 bankruptcy filing and corporate credit card\narrearage as an adverse action for security clearance purposes, and placed him one-\nyear probation for financial responsibility.   \n9\nApplicant and his family returned to the United States in late 2002. He and his\nsecond wife filed a Chapter 7 petition for bankruptcy in August 2003, again on the\nadvice of counsel. The court discharged their debts, including debts related to the first\nhouse, on November 20, 2003.  Within a few months, he and his second wife\nseparated.10\nApplicant and his wife divorced in April 2005. Under the terms of their divorce\nagreement, he pays her $1,500 a month in alimony for 10 years or until she remarries or\nco-habitats. He also pays $800 a month in child support. Initially, he paid child support\nfor two daughters, but he now pays for only one daughter, who will turn 18 in April 2010.\nAt this time, the child support will end.  \n11\nAfter he and his second wife separated, he purchased a house (third house) for\n$460,000. He rented rooms to help pay the costs of the house. His second wife moved\nback to her home state after their divorce. His two daughters, who had been living with\nhim, joined their mother in the summer of 2005. In August 2005, a devastating hurricane\nstruck the area where his second wife and daughters lived. He purchased plane tickets\nfor his daughters, who left before the hurricane struck. His second wife stayed. After the\nhurricane passed, and at the urgent request of his daughters, he used $7,000 of his\nsavings to purchase supplies, such as food and clothing, for his second wife and her\nfamily that had been devastated by the hurricane. He drove to where she lived, left the\n\nGE 2; Tr. 46-48.\n12\nGE 1; GE 2; Tr. 48-53, 109.\n13\nGE 4; GE 5; GE 6; GE 7; Tr.44, 51-56.\n14\nAE D; Tr. 51-55.\n15\n5\nsupplies for her family, and drove her back to his home. She stayed with him. He helped\nher with relocation expenses, such as first month\u2019s rent and apartment deposit.  \n12\nWith his daughters now living with him, plus his housemates and his second wife\n(for awhile), he felt his third house was too small. He listed his third house for sale. A\npurchaser offered a contract. Applicant then signed a contract on a larger house (fourth\nhouse), but did not put a contingency clause in his purchase contract. This house cost\n$738,000. The purchase contract on the third house failed. Applicant tried to withdraw\nhis purchase contract on the fourth house, but could not. He decided to proceed with\nthe purchase, believing he could sell or rent the third house. He could not. By the\nsummer of 2006, he defaulted on both mortgages, which totaled $6,100 a month, as he\ndid not have sufficient income to pay both mortgages. He chose not to stay in one\nhouse and pay its mortgage and let only one house go to foreclosure. With the real\nestate downturn beginning, he realized that the market value of both houses was\ndeclining seriously.13\nThe mortgage holder foreclosed on Applicant\u2019s third and fourth houses in 2007.\nHe financed both houses with a primary and secondary mortgage. He believes that as a\nresult of the foreclosure process, the primary mortgages have been resolved as the\nmortgagor took the property. The credit reports of record indicate that Applicant has the\nfollowing outstanding mortgage debts: $147,000, $100,000 and $403,000. The credit\nreports also reflect that he disputed the $403,000 debt, which is not resolved. Applicant\nhas not provided any information detailing the foreclosure proceedings and the actual\nresults of the foreclosure proceedings. Such documentation would provide a clearer\nunderstanding of the actual debt owed. To his knowledge, these houses have never\nsold.14\nApplicant hired a realtor, who specialized in short sales, to sell one of his homes\nin 2006. The realtor found a buyer. The mortgage company, however, refused to work\nwith him on the sale. This sale never proceeded to conclusion. Applicant contacted the\nmortgage creditors in an attempt to reach a resolution on his debts, but has not been\nsuccessful. Because his current job is temporary, he cannot commit to a repayment\nplan and has declined to provide a financial statement to the creditors. Applicant is not\nclear on how much he owes on the mortgages, but does not deny he owes this\nmoney.  \n15\nApplicant currently commutes between his home and work place. He lives\nseveral hundred miles from his job. He flies to his work location on Monday morning,\nstays in hotels during the week, and flies home on the weekend. \n\nAE A; AE B; AE C; Tr. 82-88.\n16\nTr. 81-82, 84.\n17\nId. 61.\n18\nTr. 67-74.\n19\n6\nApplicant earns $12,521 a month in gross income, and his net income is $8,466\nplus his monthly military retirement and disability benefit of $1,400. Applicant\u2019s net pay\nincreased in August 2009, when his employer stopped deducting state taxes, and again\nin September 2009, when his social security withholding ceased for the rest of 2009.\nThus, his net income is higher through December 31, 2009. Applicant\u2019s monthly\nexpenses total $9,267, leaving approximately $600 a month for debt payment. Applicant\nand his current wife pool their income and expenses. She manages their finances and\nhe believes they are doing much better because of her fiscal management. His current\nwife returned to work from her maternity leave on November 1, 2009. Her income is\nestimated at $75,000 a year or $6,250 a month before deductions.  \n16\nApplicant owns the house in which his elderly mother lives. He pays $455 a\nmonth on the mortgage on this property. His wife inherited 48 acres of land with a trailer\nwhen her father died. The land currently serves as collateral on a $45,000 loan. Under\nthe will of his wife\u2019s father, this land cannot be sold.17\nIn 2004, Applicant was denied a sensitive compartmented information (SCI)\nclearance because of his bankruptcy, but retained his top secret clearance.  \n18\n A friend and co-worker, who was the facility security officer, testified on behalf of\nApplicant. Applicant reported his problems with the two homes. In his capacity as the\nfacility security officer, he reported this adverse action to the appropriate individuals.\nApplicant\u2019s clearance was not suspended or rescinded after the report was filed. He\ndoes not question Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness or loyalty. In his opinion, Applicant would\ndie before he would give up secrets.  \n19\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\n7\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\n\n8\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has a long history of debt problems. He resolved his debts\nthrough bankruptcy on two occasions, but he continued to incur delinquent debt,\nincluding significant mortgage debt. He has been unable to pay these obligations for a\nperiod of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\u2019s debts have not\noccurred under unusual circumstances. He has a history of debt problems spanning 20\nyears. His current delinquent debts occurred three years ago, not a long time ago.\nUnder the facts of this case, this mitigating condition is not applicable.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s divorce in\n2005 and the water damage to his first house are unusual circumstances beyond his\ncontrol. The water damage contributed to his financial problems in 2000, which were\nresolved through the discharge of his debts in 2003. His divorce has not raised any\nfinancial issues. Although his second wife lost everything in a devastating hurricane in\n2005, an unusual situation, his current debts problems arose only indirectly from this\nevent. His decision to help his second wife and her family is not only admirable, but did\nnot create his current financial problem. Rather, his present financial difficulties\noccurred because he decided to purchase an expensive house before he sold the\nhouse in which he had lived for a year.  Applicant made this decision, which was not\nbeyond his control, without fully considering the ramifications. I find this potentially\nmitigating condition is not applicable. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling, and he has\nnot resolved the delinquent debts listed in the SOR, either by payment or settlement. He\nis paying his current expenses. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not\napply.\nApplicant challenged the validity of the $403,000 debt with the credit reporting\nagencies. The creditor has not resolved this depute. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to SOR\nallegation 1.f.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\n\n9\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of denying a security clearance to Applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of a granting his\nsecurity clearance. In reaching this conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this\ncase. Applicant\u2019s debt problems go back over 20 years. In 1988, he resolved his debt\nissues through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the wage earners plan. He complied with the\nrepayment plan and the court discharged his debts in 1992. When he decided to rent\nhis first house instead of selling it, his financial problems soon became out-of-control.\nThe house developed serious problems requiring expensive repairs, which he could not\nafford. He filed bankruptcy again. He did not complete this repayment plan, in part, due\nto problems with the mail. When he learned that the mail was slow, he did not rethink\nhis payment schedule to assure that his payments would be received by the court in a\ntimely manner. His financial problems have continued throughout this decade. He does\npay his current expenses, as his wife manages their income and payment of their\ncurrent debts and expenses. \nApplicant has been open and honest about his debt problems. Thus, there is little\nlikelihood he can be coerced, exploited, or pressured to reveal government secrets\nbecause of his debts. However, he has not acted responsibly about his finances for\nmany years. His employer placed him on one year of probation for financial\nirresponsibility in 2001. He was denied a SCI clearance because of his financial\nproblems. Applicant has been on notice for some time that he needs to take\nresponsibility for his finances and financial-decision making. When he decided to allow\nboth houses he owned to go to foreclosure in 2006, he made a poor financial decision.\nFrom his testimony, I find that he made this decision because the property had declined\n\n10\nto a value significantly below his purchase price. Only recently has he begun to take\nsome control over his finances. In reaching my decision, I considered the many years\nApplicant has held a security clearance without any violations. This factor by itself is not\nenough to overcome his many years of poor financial-decision making. Applicant has\nnot mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns.\n   \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Department Counsel requested a hearing.   On September 21, 2009, after the\n1\nhearing, Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\n\n\u201cQ: [W]hy didn\u2019t you mark down [on the SCA] that you had bills that were outstanding?\u201d . . . A: Honestly, I\n2\ndon\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t think I was trying to hide it.  It\u2019s just I guess I needed to get a Credit Report and see\nwhat my credit was and you had brought it to my attention.\u201d  Tr. at 26.  \u201cQ: Why did you only list one of your arrests\nand not the other four in your [SCA]?  A: I have no excuse.  I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t . . . Maybe it was so long ago I\nforgot.  I don\u2019t want to say I lied.  I just didn\u2019t do it.  I don\u2019t know if I was in a hurry to fill out the questionnaire.  But\nyou all found it pretty quick and straightened me out.\u201d  Tr. at 35.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process because\nhe was not represented by counsel; whether the Judge failed to consider all the record evidence;\nwhether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts.  Of the 29 debts listed in the\nSOR, Applicant had paid off only one.  For the others he had made no attempt to make payments,\ndespite having a sufficient amount of money to do so.  Additionally, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to\nquestions on the security clearance application (SCA) inquiring about debts delinquent over 180 days\nand about whether he currently had debts delinquent for 90 days. These answers were not true.  On\na SCA question concerning charges or convictions related to alcohol or drugs, Applicant omitted\nfour charges for illegal possession of alcohol; public intoxication and resisting arrest; possession of\nmarijuana; and public intoxication and domestic violence.    \nRegarding the delinquent debts, the Judge concluded, inter alia, that Applicant had not\ndemonstrated any effort to pay off his remaining debts, that he had not presented evidence of a plan\nto do so, and that he had not demonstrated that his failure to pay his debts is due to causes outside\nhis control.  Regarding the omissions on the SOR, the Judge stated that the questions were clear and\nunambiguous; that Applicant\u2019s educational attainments were such that he should have been able to\nunderstand their meaning; and that he had provided no credible reason for having omitted the\ninformation in question.   Accordingly, the Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the\n2\nsecurity concerns arising from his financial condition and from his omissions to the SOR.\nApplicant contends that his ability to present his case was hampered by his lack of\nrepresentation.  The record demonstrates, however, that prior to the hearing Applicant was informed\nin writing of his rights, including the right to counsel or some other representative.  Furthermore, at\nthe beginning of the hearing the Judge asked Applicant if he understood his right to counsel and if\nhe intended to represent himself.  Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to both questions.  Tr. at 6.  A review\nof the entire record discloses no basis to conclude that Applicant was denied the rights due him under\nthe Directive or that he had not been adequately advised of those rights.  ISCR Case No. 08-03110\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 2009).  \u201cHaving decided to represent himself during the proceedings below,\nApplicant cannot fairly complain about the quality of his self-representation or seek to be relieved\nof the consequences of his decision to represent himself.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 08-03110 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJan. 27, 2009). \nApplicant also contends that the Judge failed to consider his explanations for the conduct\ngiving rise to the security concerns in this case.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered\n\nall the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009);\nISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  Applicant has pointed to nothing in the\nrecord that would rebut the presumption.  Furthermore, a party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation thereof, is not sufficient\nto demonstrate the Judge either failed to consider all of the evidence or mis-weighed it.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  In his appeal brief, Applicant submits\nmatters not contained in the record, which the Board cannot consider.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo\nnew evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-\n06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009); ADP\nCase No. 08-03721 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2009).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, both as to the mitigating conditions and\nthe whole-person factors.  The decision draws \u201ca \u2018rational connection between the facts found and\nthe choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\n463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national security to grant\nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.  Decision at 9.  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

Applicant is 38 years old and has been a security guard and emergency medical technician for a defense contractor for over two years. He also is a full-time college student and anticipates receiving his degree in two more semesters App. Ex. G, Transcript, dated August 18, 2009). He does not believe he ever requested or was granted a security clearance even though he worked construction at a military installation. He had periods of unemployment over the last ten years when he was a construction worker. The last time he remembers being unemployed was about seven years ago. (Tr. 21-24). Applicant is a certified Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), certified ambulance driver, and certified in basic life support programs (App. Ex. A, Certificate; App. Ex. B, Certificate, dated February 6, 2009; App. Ex. C, Certificate, dated February 24, 2009). He has been recognized by his company for outstanding service (App. Ex.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on March 31, 2008, as part of his employment with a defense contractor. On \nMay 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations \nunder Guideline F, and for personal conduct under Guideline E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nJune 13, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response that was received \nby DOHA on June 29, 2009. The explanation he provided that accompanied his \nresponse was dated June 25, 2009. He admitted 24 and denied 5 allegations under \nGuideline F. He denied the security concern for financial considerations. He admitted \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 21, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthree and denied one of the four sub-allegations under Guideline E pertaining to his \nfailure to list arrests on his security clearance application. He denied the allegations \nunder Guideline E pertaining to not listing debts more that 180 days past due in the last \nseven years and currently more than 90 days past due. He denied the security concern \nfor Guideline E. He provided an explanation for his financial issues and his personal \nconduct. He did not request a hearing before an administrative judge. Department \nCounsel did request a hearing and was ready to proceed on July 10, 2009. The case \nwas assigned to me on July 20, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 30, \n2009, for a hearing on August 20, 2009. Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on \nAugust 8, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered five \nexhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his behalf and offered nine exhibits, marked \nApplicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A - I which were received without objection. The record \nwas left open for Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted \none document marked App. Ex. J. Department Counsel did not object to the admission \nof the document (Gov. Ex. 6, Memorandum, dated September 16, 2009). DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 25, 2009. Based on a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on August 8, 2009. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with \nDepartment Counsel the hearing date of August 20, 2009, prior to the mailing of a \nNotice of Hearing. Accordingly, actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the \nhearing. However, Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only 12 days prior to the \nhearing. He waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 6). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 38 years old and has been a security guard and emergency medical \ntechnician for a defense contractor for over two years. He also is a full-time college \nstudent and anticipates receiving his degree in two more semesters App. Ex. G, \nTranscript, dated August 18, 2009). He does not believe he ever requested or was \ngranted a security clearance even though he worked construction at a military \ninstallation. He had periods of unemployment over the last ten years when he was a \nconstruction worker. The last time he remembers being unemployed was about seven \nyears ago. (Tr. 21-24). Applicant is a certified Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), \ncertified ambulance driver, and certified in basic life support programs (App. Ex. A, \nCertificate; App. Ex. B, Certificate, dated February 6, 2009; App. Ex. C, Certificate, \ndated February 24, 2009). He has been recognized by his company for outstanding \nservice (App. Ex. D, Certificate, dated July 28, 2009). His present monthly net salary is \n\n \n3 \n \n \n$3,840, with monthly expenses of approximately $2,100, leaving approximately $1,800 \nin monthly discretionary funds (Tr. 32-33). \n \nCredit reports list the following financial issues for Appellant: medical debts in \ncollection for $1,465 (SOR 1.a), $938 (SOR 1.b), $253 (SOR 1.c), $391 (SOR 1.d), \n$324 (SOR 1.e), $377 (SOR 1.f), $253 (SOR 1.g), $209 (SOR 1.h), $435 (SOR 1.i), \n$363 (SOR 1.j), $469 (SOR 1.k), $3,876 (SOR 1.l), $664 (SOR 1.m), $234 (SOR 1.n), \n$1,122 (SOR 1.o), $348 (SOR 1.t), $216 (216 (SOR 1.u), $68 (SOR 1.v), $454 (SOR \n1.w), $3,338 (SOR 1.x), $343 (SOR 1.y), $298 (SOR 1.z), $281 (SOR 1.aa), and \n$11,785 (SOR 1.bb); a credit card debt in collection for $771 (SOR 1.p); an account in \ncollection with a jeweler for $3,728 (SOR 1.q); a telephone account in collection for \n$109 (SOR 1.r); an account in collection for $123 (SOR 1.s); and another telephone \naccount in collection for $111 (SOR 1.cc; Gov. Ex. 3, Credit report, dated April 22, \n2008). He also has student loans of approximately $10,000 in deferment (Tr. 33). \nApplicant admitted the medical debts but denied the debts at SOR 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s. \nMost of these debts arose from 2006 to 2007 (Tr. 24-25). \n \nApplicant recently sold his house and made a profit of approximately $60,000.  \nThe majority of the proceeds from the house sale were deposited in Applicant's bank \naccount on August 14, 2009 (App. Ex. H, Account Information, dated august 14, 2009 \n(prior to the deposit), App, Ex. I, Account information, dated August 14, 2009 (after the \ndeposit)). The account has a balance of over $60,000 (Tr. 33-34).  \n \nApplicant believes most of the medical bills are from his visits to hospital \nemergency rooms for a bulging disc, and a cut on his hand from barbed wire. He also \nhad a hospital stay for an appendix removal. Since he worked construction during most \nof this time, he did not have health insurance. He only recently obtained health \ninsurance (Tr. 10-11, 25-26, 28-29).  \n \nApplicant settled his debt with the collection agency for the jeweler for $2,343.35 \n(App. Ex. E, Letter, dated June 29, 2009). This debt was paid in the settlement for the \nsale of his house (Tr. 26-27; App. Ex. F, Settlement document, dated July 16, 2009). \n \nApplicant denied the credit card debt at 1.p. The card was a membership credit \ncard which was opened with a credit balance from him of $150. He used it only once \nand the company charged him membership fees. He denied owing the creditor the \namount of the debt. SOR allegation 1.q was the jeweler debt that was settled and paid. \nApplicant believes he paid the creditor at SOR 1.r. He did not present any information to \nestablish payment of the debt. He has no information on the debt at SOR 1.s, so he has \nnot paid the debt (Tr. 30-31). \n \nApplicant also paid a debt not listed on the SOR. He paid a utility debt of $421.  \nThis was not his debt but one from his brother who used his name to obtain the service. \nNonetheless, he paid the debt (Tr. 27-28; Gov. Ex. 4, Answer to Interrogatories, dated \nMarch 2, 2009, at 4). His student loans are in deferment since he is still in school (Tr. \n28-29). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has not paid his other delinquent debts because he only had limited \nfunds and not enough time to pursue past debts and creditors. He is working and \nattending school full-time. He also stated that he really did not have an excuse for not \npaying the other debts. Applicant has not yet taken any action on his debts because he \nhas \"had so much going on, between working and going to school full-time and moving \nand doing all this stuff. I just really don't have an excuse, I don't guess.\" (Tr. 25-26, 28-\n29, 34-35). He stated he intends to employ a debt consolidation specialist to assist him \nin paying his debts and reestablishing his credit. After the hearing, Applicant employed \nan attorney who notes he is assisting Applicant in satisfying his debs and meeting his \nfinancial obligations (App. EX. J, Letter, dated September 4, 2009). \n \nApplicant did not list all offenses in response to question 23(d) on the e-QIP \nasking if he had ever been charged or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or \ndrugs. Applicant listed a disorderly conduct offense in 1996. A Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) criminal justice report shows Applicant was charged with illegal \npossession of prohibited liquor on May 9, 1992, with public intoxication on March 1, \n1997, with possession of marijuana on July 17, 1998, and with public intoxication on \nSeptember 21, 2004 (Gov. Ex. 2, Criminal Justice Information report, dated April 22, \n2008). Applicant also answered NO to question 28 concerning any delinquent debts in \nthe last seven years more than 180 days past due, and any debts currently more than \n90 days past due. As noted above, he has delinquent debts since 2006.  \n \nApplicant testified that in completing his security clearance application, human \nresource personnel for his employer had him provide them a written answer to the \nquestions, and they entered his answers on the computer driven document. He knew he \nhad delinquent debts for medical expenses but did not know the number or the amounts \nof the debts. He had received inquires about his medical debts but not recently. He is \n\"not real sure\" why he did not provide any information concerning his delinquent debts. \nIn response to the question concerning being arrested or charged with an offense \ninvolving alcohol or drugs, he stated he read the question and does not understand why \nhe did not answer it correctly. He stated that he now remembers the offense. He further \nstated \"But I don't know if I was in a rush or - -I didn't intentionally mean to lie. I mean it \nmakes me sound really bad. But I just - - the only defense I have is that I forgot\" (Tr. 35-\n41). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n \n5 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \n\n \n6 \n \n \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts as listed on credit reports and admitted by \nApplicant are a security concern raising Financial Considerations Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).   \n \n \nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) raised \nby Applicant's testimony. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was \nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), \nand FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) do not apply. Applicant incurred delinquent \nmedical debt when he did not have health insurance and had to visit emergency rooms \nfor treatment and was hospitalized. He has not inquired about or paid any of the debt.  \nHe has other debts that he has not paid. The debts are numerous and still current. \nApplicant presented no circumstance beyond his control that caused him to incur debt \nor prevented him from paying the debts. He has not paid the debts even though he has \nthe resources to pay them. He has not established that he acted responsibly towards \nhis financial obligations. \n \n \nFC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant presented documentation to establish he consulted \nan attorney after the hearing to assist him in satisfying his debts and meeting his \nfinancial obligations. However, he has not presented any information to show he \ndeveloped a plan or made any attempts to pay his financial obligations. There is no \nclear indication, therefore, that the financial problems are being resolved or are under \ncontrol.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\". For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed. \nGood-faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation. Most of the debts arose in the 2006 and 2007 time \nframe. Applicant presented no information to show he is paying his delinquent debts. He \nmay in the past have resolved two debts, but he has numerous debts for which he \nadmits he has not contacted the creditors or made any attempt to pay. He has not \nestablished a meaningful, reasonable, honest, or prudent plan to pay his debts. He has \nthe resources to pay his debts, but presented no plan to do so. Applicant did not present \nsufficient information to establish a good-faith effort to pay creditors or resolve debts. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nHis finances are not under control and he has not acted responsibly. Accordingly, he did \nnot mitigate security concerns for financial considerations. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process (AG \u00b6 15). Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information. The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information. \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government. Applicant\u2019s incomplete answers on his \nsecurity clearance application concerning charges or arrests relating to alcohol or drugs, \nand debts past due more than 180 days or 90 days, raise a security concern under \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) \"the deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct investigations, to \ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness.\" \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence to establish the disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b6 16(a). The burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the concerns raised under personal conduct (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15). An applicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government (See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)).   \n \n \nWhile there is a security concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of \na material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when \napplying for a security clearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement \nis not a falsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is \ndone knowingly and willfully. Applicant denied intentionally providing false or misleading \ninformation, but he could not explain why he did not provide accurate information in \nresponse to the questions. The questions to which Applicant provided false information \nare straightforward and uncomplicated. Applicant is within two semesters of graduating \nfrom college so he should be able to understand the intent of the questions. Applicant's \ntestimony on this issue is basically that he did not know why he did not provide accurate \ninformation.  He knew that he had delinquent debts, and he knew he had committed \ncriminal acts that related to alcohol and drug use. He admitted to most of the allegations \nwhen they were included in the SOR. Applicant was either very careless or deliberately \nprovided false information in completing the e-QIP. Since Applicant could not provide \nany reason for his failure to provide accurate information, I conclude he has failed to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmitigate the security concern for personal conduct. The government established that \nApplicant acted deliberately with the intent to deceive when answering questions on the \ne-QIP. I find none of the Personal Conduct Mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 17 apply. I find \nagainst Applicant as to Personal Conduct.  \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant's good \nreputation at work, his continued efforts to complete his college education, and his \ncertification and service as an emergency medical technician.  \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. He is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that he paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that \nis required is that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems and takes significant \naction to implement that plan. The entirety of his financial situation and his actions can \nreasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which his plan to reduce his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about \nthe person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and \nconcomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time.   \n \nApplicant has not established a meaningful track record of debt payment \nbecause he has not paid most of his debts. He has sufficient monthly income as well as \nsavings from the sale of his house to meet his financial obligations. Applicant had the \nopportunity to develop and demonstrate a plan to pay his delinquent debts.  He did not \n\n \n9 \n \n \nestablish a plan but just showed that he had contacted an attorney to assist him in \nresolving and paying his debts. He did not demonstrate a credible and realistic plan to \npay his delinquent debts. He has not demonstrated that he is managing his finances \nresponsibly under the circumstances. The lack of responsible action to manage past \nobligations indicates Applicant may not be concerned and responsible, but careless, in \nregard to classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. I conclude \nAppellant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation and \npersonal conduct, and he is not suitable for a security clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.p:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r to 1.cc:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusions \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Department Counsel requested a hearing.   On September 21, 2009, after the\n1\nhearing, Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n\u201cQ: [W]hy didn\u2019t you mark down [on the SCA] that you had bills that were outstanding?\u201d . . . A: Honestly, I\n2\ndon\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t think I was trying to hide it.  It\u2019s just I guess I needed to get a Credit Report and see\nwhat my credit was and you had brought it to my attention.\u201d  Tr. at 26.  \u201cQ: Why did you only list one of your arrests\nand not the other four in your [SCA]?  A: I have no excuse.  I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t . . . Maybe it was so long ago I\nforgot.  I don\u2019t want to say I lied.  I just didn\u2019t do it.  I don\u2019t know if I was in a hurry to fill out the questionnaire.  But\nyou all found it pretty quick and straightened me out.\u201d  Tr. at 35.  \n2\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process because\nhe was not represented by counsel; whether the Judge failed to consider all the record evidence;\nwhether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts.  Of the 29 debts listed in the\nSOR, Applicant had paid off only one.  For the others he had made no attempt to make payments,\ndespite having a sufficient amount of money to do so.  Additionally, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to\nquestions on the security clearance application (SCA) inquiring about debts delinquent over 180 days\nand about whether he currently had debts delinquent for 90 days. These answers were not true.  On\na SCA question concerning charges or convictions related to alcohol or drugs, Applicant omitted\nfour charges for illegal possession of alcohol; public intoxication and resisting arrest; possession of\nmarijuana; and public intoxication and domestic violence.    \nRegarding the delinquent debts, the Judge concluded, inter alia, that Applicant had not\ndemonstrated any effort to pay off his remaining debts, that he had not presented evidence of a plan\nto do so, and that he had not demonstrated that his failure to pay his debts is due to causes outside\nhis control.  Regarding the omissions on the SOR, the Judge stated that the questions were clear and\nunambiguous; that Applicant\u2019s educational attainments were such that he should have been able to\nunderstand their meaning; and that he had provided no credible reason for having omitted the\ninformation in question.   Accordingly, the Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the\n2\nsecurity concerns arising from his financial condition and from his omissions to the SOR.\nApplicant contends that his ability to present his case was hampered by his lack of\nrepresentation.  The record demonstrates, however, that prior to the hearing Applicant was informed\nin writing of his rights, including the right to counsel or some other representative.  Furthermore, at\nthe beginning of the hearing the Judge asked Applicant if he understood his right to counsel and if\nhe intended to represent himself.  Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to both questions.  Tr. at 6.  A review\nof the entire record discloses no basis to conclude that Applicant was denied the rights due him under\nthe Directive or that he had not been adequately advised of those rights.  ISCR Case No. 08-03110\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 2009).  \u201cHaving decided to represent himself during the proceedings below,\nApplicant cannot fairly complain about the quality of his self-representation or seek to be relieved\nof the consequences of his decision to represent himself.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 08-03110 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJan. 27, 2009). \nApplicant also contends that the Judge failed to consider his explanations for the conduct\ngiving rise to the security concerns in this case.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered\n\n3\nall the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009);\nISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  Applicant has pointed to nothing in the\nrecord that would rebut the presumption.  Furthermore, a party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation thereof, is not sufficient\nto demonstrate the Judge either failed to consider all of the evidence or mis-weighed it.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  In his appeal brief, Applicant submits\nmatters not contained in the record, which the Board cannot consider.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo\nnew evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-\n06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009); ADP\nCase No. 08-03721 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2009).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, both as to the mitigating conditions and\nthe whole-person factors.  The decision draws \u201ca \u2018rational connection between the facts found and\nthe choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national security to grant\nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns raised under\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. Clearance is denied.\nOn September 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn September 30, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, denied all of the\nallegations except SOR subparagraph 1.a, and requested an administrative\ndetermination. On October 21, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM), and DOHA mailed it to Applicant. He received it on October 27, 2009,\nFebruary 26, 2010\n\n2\nalong with instructions to file any objections or supplementary information within 30\ndays. Applicant prepared a written response within the allotted time, and Department\nCounsel had no objection. The case was assigned to me on December 14, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old married man with three adult children. After graduating\nfrom high school in 1982, he joined the United States (U.S.) Air Force, where he served\nfor 21 years through his retirement in 2003 (Item 4 at 10). Since 2003, he has been\nworking as a security guard for a defense contractor (Id.).\nApplicant has four delinquent debts, as listed in the SOR, totalling approximately\n$245,000. SOR subparagraph 1.a is a dental bill in the amount of $1,974. Applicant\ndisputes this account contending that he paid the copayment, as required, but that his\ndental insurance provider failed to pay the remainder (Item 4 at 31). When Applicant\ncontacted his insurer, he was informed that they were waiting to receive copies of x-rays\nfrom his dentist before they would pay the remainder (Item 2 at 3). Applicant\u2019s dentist\nnever provided copies of the x-rays to the insurance provider, as Applicant requested\n(Id.). Applicant did not provide any documentation supporting his dispute.\nSOR subparagraph 1.b is Applicant\u2019s home mortgage that the bank foreclosed\nupon. The date of the foreclosure is unknown from the record. Also, it is unclear\nwhether the amount listed in the SOR ($227,000) is the mortgage balance or the\ndeficiency. Applicant fell behind on his mortgage after the monthly payment increased,\nper the terms of the loan, from $1,765 to $2,495 monthly (Item 2 at 3). At or about the\ntime Applicant\u2019s mortgage payment increased, one of his children incurred a major\nmedical bill (Item 4 at 33). \nApplicant unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a reduced monthly mortgage\npayment. He then used money borrowed from his 401(k) account to make mortgage\npayments. Ultimately, Applicant was unable to prevent the bank from foreclosing on his\nhome. Applicant provided no evidence of the current status of the delinquency.\nSOR subparagraph 1.c is a credit card account that became delinquent in\nNovember 2008 (Item 8 at 6). As of the SOR date, the balance was $8,250. Applicant\ncontends he has been making monthly payments debited from his military retirement\naccount (Item 3 at 2). The evidence he provided in support of his contention (Item 3 at\n5) is inconclusive.\nSOR subparagraph 1.d is a delinquent credit card account in the amount of\n$8,000. Applicant contends that he satisfied the account in August 2009 (Item 3 at 3).\nThe evidence he provided indicates he made a $300 payment in February 2009, but is\ninconclusive as to whether he made any other payments (Id.).\nApplicant maintains a budget. He has approximately $1,529 of after-expense\nincome, and $21,000 in his 401(k) plan (Item 5 at 3). \n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. The protection of the national security is the\nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel\nbeing considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national\nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies triggers the application of AG \u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s most significant delinquency is the mortgage balance from his\nforeclosed home. The escalation of Applicant\u2019s adjustable rate mortgage on this home\noccurred at or about the same time a major medical bill for one of his children became\ndue. Applicant took multiple steps to avoid foreclosure including negotiating with the\nlender and borrowing money from his 401(k) to make payments. Although these efforts\nwere unsuccessful, they are sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d \n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s dispute with his dental insurance provider, which is the source of the\ndelinquency alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a, is credible. However, Applicant failed to \neither \u201cprovide documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provide\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d as required for AG \u00b6 20(e) to apply.\nSimilarly, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to support his contention\nthat he is satisfying the delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.c, and that he has\nsatisfied the delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d. Consequently, none of the\nother mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAbsent sufficient proof that Applicant has rehabilitated his finances, the likelihood\nthat his financial problems will continue is unacceptably high. Upon considering this\ncase in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\u2019s troubled\nfinances continue to render him a security risk.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 50 years old and has completed two years of college. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Field Service Technician, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants. Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct. The Applicant served honorably in the United States Air Force from October 1977 to March 1991, over thirteen years. He has been arrested and convicted on six separate occasions for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), and on one occasion for Disorderly Conduct Involving Alcohol.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nDecember 10, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on June 17, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On July 13, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines G, E and J for Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel; Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 3, 3009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on September 2, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 14, 2009, and\nthe matter was scheduled for hearing on November 20, 2009.  At the hearing, the\nGovernment presented five exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5,\nwhich were received without objection. The Applicant presented no exhibits, but testified\n\n2\non his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 2,\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 50 years old and has completed two years of college.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Field Service Technician, and is applying for a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant served honorably in the United States Air Force from October\n1977 to March 1991, over thirteen years.  He has been arrested and convicted on six\nseparate occasions for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), and on one\noccasion for Disorderly Conduct Involving Alcohol.  In April 2008, he began working for\na defense contractor.\nThe Applicant was first arrested in approximately 1985, while on active duty.  He\nwas arrested on base by military police and charged with DUI.  He did not take a\nbreathalyser test.  He received non-judicial punishment and was reduced in grade.\nApplicant\u2019s second arrest for DUI occurred in 1989, again on the Air Force Base.\nThis time, he did not inform his chain of command of this arrest.  Applicant was\nsubsequently punished for this conduct.  Applicant testified that because of the DUI\u2019s he\nreceived in the Air Force, he lost his security clearance and he was denied extended re-\nenlistment.\nFollowing these two arrests, in 1989, the Applicant attended a thirty day in-\npatient treatment program at the Air Force Base.  During the program, he abstained\nfrom consuming alcohol for a period following the program, before he returned to\nconsuming alcohol again.  Applicant testified that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA) for five years and found it very helpful.  At one point, the Applicant believes that he\nhad over three years of sobriety.  (Tr. p. 26).  He thinks that this period of sobriety may\nhave been between 1989 and 1994.  (Tr. p. 28).    \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s third arrest for DUI occurred on or about August 1999.  He failed to\nappear at trial.\nOn or about February 1998, the Applicant was arrested and charged with\ndisorderly conduct.  On this occasion, he had been drinking to excess.\nApplicant\u2019s fourth arrest for DUI occurred on or about July 2001.\nOn or about October 2004, the Applicant was arrested for the fifth time of DUI.\nHe was also arrested for reckless driving, and for refusing the breath test. Applicant\nexplained that he and his wife, at the time, were drinking at a bar, got into an argument,\nand he decided to drive home.  While driving, he was pulled over by the police.      \nApplicant\u2019s sixth arrest for DUI occurred on or about November 2004.  He\nexplained that he had consumed about eight to nine beers at a bar.  To avoid a fight, he\ndecided to drive home. On the way home he struck a telephone pole.  Police arrived at\nthe scene, detected the odor of alcohol and the Applicant was arrested.  Applicant failed\nto appear at trial and in October 2006, a warrant was issued for his arrest.  He left the\nstate and has no plans to return until the statute of limitations has run.\n    \nApplicant testified that following his most recent arrest for DUI, he changed his\ndrinking habits.  He currently drinks on a daily basis and has four beers in the evening.\n(Tr. p. 20).  He has moved to a state that has a great transportation system and so he\nno longer drinks and drives.  He does not believe that he has a drinking problem.  He\nstates that a twelve pack is what it takes to make him feel intoxicated.  (Tr. p. 23).  Due\nto health reasons, he had considered stopping his consumption of alcohol.  (Tr. p. 24).  \nHe believes alcohol has only caused him \u201cmoderate problems\u201d in his life and he has\nbeen able to deal with them.  (Tr. p. 25).  He is also considering returning to AA, but he\nis not motivated to do so simply because his security clearance is in jeopardy.  (Tr. p.\n29).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), Standard Form 86, dated June 17, 2008, which asked him if he had\never been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs.  The\nApplicant responded \u201cyes\u201d and disclosed three charged offenses, set forth in 1(a), 1(b),\nand 1(c), but failed to disclose his arrests and alcohol related offenses in 1(d) through\n1(h) of the SOR.  (Government Exhibit 1).  \nApplicant explained that he misunderstood the question and was not attempting\nto conceal any of his DUI\u2019s or any other alcohol related offenses from the Government.\n(Tr. p. 23).  He listed those offenses that occurred within seven or ten years, whatever\n\n4\nhe believed the question required, and he left out the others.  He states that he was not\ntrying to hide anything from the Government.  (Tr. p. 22).      \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent;\n22(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g. physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) or alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; \n22(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of\nan alcohol rehabilitation program.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\n\n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\nNone.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne. The extent to which the participation is voluntary;\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng. The motivation for the conduct; \n\n6\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress;\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse, dishonesty and/or criminal conduct that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G), dishonesty (Guideline E), and\nCriminal Conduct (Guideline J).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the\n\n7\nApplicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security\nclearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines G and J of the SOR.\nThe Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct includes six arrests\nand convictions for DUI\u2019s, and one for disorderly conduct involving alcohol.  Although his\nmost recent arrest occurred in 2004, about five years ago, he continues to consume\nalcohol, which has been at the root of his criminal problems.  As a result of his most\nrecent arrest, he failed to appear in court, and left the state to avoid the matter.  His in-\npatient treatment program for alcohol abuse in 1989, and his AA participation appeared\nto be helpful, as he was able to maintain sobriety for several years.  However, he has\nstopped attending AA and started drinking again.  He has tried on his own to abstain\nfrom the use of alcohol, but has not been able to do it.  Although the record contains no\nformal diagnosis of alcohol dependence, the Applicant\u2019s past history of alcohol abuse\nclearly demonstrates that there has been and still is a serious problem.  \nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, Disqualifying Conditions 22(a), alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 22(c)\nhabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent and,\n22(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; 22(f) relapse after\ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  \nDespite AA\u2019s recommendation that the Applicant completely abstain from the use\nof alcohol, the Applicant continues to consume alcohol on a daily basis.  It is not clear\nfrom his past record that he will not again return to his old ways.  Based upon his long\nhistory of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct, its related negative effects on the\nApplicant are such that I am unable to find him sufficiently trustworthy to safeguard\nclassified information.  Accordingly Guidelines G and J are found against the Applicant. \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, I do not find that the Applicant deliberately\nomitted, concealed or falsified any material facts on his security clearance application.\nThe Applicant\u2019s testimony, explanation, and demeanor was reasonable, credible and\n\n8\npainfully honest.  In fact, he admitted his most recent criminal incidents.  Accordingly, I\nfind for the Applicant under this guideline. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 50 years old, has a\nserious history of alcohol abuse involving numerous alcohol related incidents, and\ncontinues to drink alcohol.  He has left the state to avoid his most recent court matter.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth above when\nviewed under all of the guidelines as a whole, support a whole person assessment of\npoor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, however, it does not come close\nto mitigating the negative effects of his excessive alcohol abuse, and his criminal\nconduct; and the effects that it can have on his ability to safeguard classified\ninformation.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the SOR.  Paragraph 2 is found for the\nApplicant.  \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 3: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n9\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The amended SOR alleged under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, that Applicant was fined and ordered to attend counseling following his arrest for driving under the influence (DUI) in August 2006 (SOR 1.a); that he pleaded guilty to chemical test refusal, was fined, and ordered to attend alcohol counseling following an arrest for DUI in July 2006 (SOR 1.b); that he was convicted of chemical test refusal following an arrest for operating under the influence of liquor in April 1995 (SOR 1.c); and that he attended alcohol counseling from December 2006 to April 2007 for diagnosed alcohol abuse (SOR 1.d). Under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Applicant was alleged to have used and purchased marijuana in about August 2008 (SOR 2.a and 2.b); to have expressed during a September 2008 security interview that he might use marijuana in the future if he felt like it (SOR 2.c); and to have been charged with possession of marijuana in May 1985 (SOR 2.d).

Garcia, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant used marijuana in July or August 2008, after he had been advised of his \nemployer\u201fs drug policy prohibiting illegal drug involvement, and he is unwilling to commit to \nabstain from future marijuana use. He was arrested several times between 1985 and \nAugust 2006, most recently for drunk driving, and he was not completely forthcoming about \nhis criminal record when he applied for his security clearance in July 2008. Clearance \ndenied. \n \n \nStatement of the Case  \n \nOn February 3, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nG (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) that provided the basis for its preliminary decision to \nrevoke his security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \n \nNovember 26, 2010\n\n \n \n2 \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on February 9, 2010, and indicated he \ndid not want a hearing. The Government subsequently requested a hearing, and on April \n30, 2010, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On April 27, 2010, I \nscheduled a hearing for May 26, 2010. \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Fifteen Government exhibits (Ex. 1-15) were \nentered into evidence, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on \nJune 4, 2010. At the Government\u201fs request, before the introduction of any evidence, SOR \n4.b was amended to correct an obvious typographical error and allege that Applicant \ndeliberately omitted from his July 2008 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) a May 1985 marijuana possession charge alleged in SOR 3.h. At the \nconclusion of the Government\u201fs case, Department Counsel moved to strike from the \nGuideline H allegations 2.a and 2.b the respective references to drug use and purchase \nwhile possessing a DoD security clearance, based on Applicant\u201fs testimony that he was \nunaware that he had been granted an interim clearance (see Tr. 45.). The Government \nalso moved to change the date of the drug use and purchase to August 2008 based on the \nevidence. Applicant did not object, and I granted the amendments.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe amended SOR alleged under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, that Applicant \nwas fined and ordered to attend counseling following his arrest for driving under the \ninfluence (DUI) in August 2006 (SOR 1.a); that he pleaded guilty to chemical test refusal, \nwas fined, and ordered to attend alcohol counseling following an arrest for DUI in July 2006 \n(SOR 1.b); that he was convicted of chemical test refusal following an arrest for operating \nunder the influence of liquor in April 1995 (SOR 1.c); and that he attended alcohol \ncounseling from December 2006 to April 2007 for diagnosed alcohol abuse (SOR 1.d). \n \nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Applicant was alleged to have used and \npurchased marijuana in about August 2008 (SOR 2.a and 2.b); to have expressed during a \nSeptember 2008 security interview that he might use marijuana in the future if he felt like it \n(SOR 2.c); and to have been charged with possession of marijuana in May 1985 (SOR \n2.d). \n \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, that Applicant pleaded no \ncontest to leaving the scene of an accident with property damage in May 2006, and was \nlater arrested in April 2007 for failure to pay his fines, costs, and restitution (SOR 3.a); that \nhe was convicted of a November 2000 criminal trespass offense (SOR 3.b); that he was \nsentenced to probation for one year after pleading no contest to an April 1995 leaving the \nscene of an accident charge (SOR 3.c); that he was sentenced to one year in jail \n(suspended) for criminal trespass in March 1995 (SOR 3.d); that he was charged with \nmisdemeanor refusal to post bond and improper start in May 1990 (SOR 3.e); that he \n\n \n \n3 \npleaded guilty to April 1990 charges of felony battery on a law enforcement officer, failure \nto elude a police officer, and license not carried, and was sentenced to 18 months \nprobation for the felony battery charge (SOR 3.f); that he was charged with disorderly \nconduct in April 1990 (SOR 3.g); and that he was arrested in May 1985 for breach of \npeace, felony possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle, threatening, and possession of \nmarijuana, and fined $35 for breach of peace (SOR 3.h). The alcohol-related offenses \ndetailed under Guideline G were cross-alleged under Guideline J (SOR 3.i). \n \nUnder the Personal Conduct guideline (Guideline E), Applicant was alleged to have \ndeliberately falsified his July 17, 2008 e-QIP by denying that he had ever been charged \nwith or convicted of a felony offense (SOR 4.a), by not disclosing the July and August 2006 \nalcohol charges and the May 1985 marijuana possession charge in response to inquiry into \nany alcohol or drug related charges (SOR 4.b), and by omitting the August 2006 DUI \ncharge and the May 2006 leaving the scene of an accident charge in response to inquiry \ninto any other charges within the last seven years (SOR 4.c). \n \nApplicant admitted the DUI charges but denied the diagnosis of alcohol abuse. He \nacknowledged that he had used marijuana \u201cvery seldom,\u201d had purchased it around \nSeptember 2008, and had indicated in an interview that he might use it in the future if he \nfelt like it. Before he presented any evidence at his hearing, he clarified that his admission \nwas to having used and purchased marijuana but not to being involved with the drug while \nholding a security clearance since he had never held a security clearance. (Tr. 12-13.) \nApplicant admitted the criminal arrests alleged in Guideline J, but he denied any deliberate \nfalsification of his July 2008 security clearance application. After considering the pleadings, \nexhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 63 years old, and he has been employed as a sound dampening \ntechnician by a defense contractor since December 1998. (Tr. 115.) His wages have been \ngarnished since 2000 to pay child support for his 15-year-old son, who was born to him and \nhis ex-wife after their divorce. (Ex. 1, 2.) Applicant seeks a Secret clearance for his duties.  \n \nApplicant served in the United States military from June 1967 to July 1973. (Ex. 1.) \nHe began drinking alcohol at that time. (Ex. 2.) Around 1985, he began using marijuana \nsporadically, and he purchased it from street dealers whom he did not know. (Tr. 53-56.) \nHis involvement with marijuana led to his arrest only once. In May 1985, Applicant was \narrested for breach of peace, felony possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle, \nthreatening, and possession of less than four ounces of marijuana, after he became \ninvolved in an altercation with a gas station attendant. He was found to be in possession of \nmarijuana in the lid of a shaving cream can (Ex. 2, Tr. 63-65.), but he was fined only $35 \nfor breach of peace. The other charges were not prosecuted. (Ex. 4.) \n \nApplicant\u201fs consumption of alcohol, primarily a mixed drink (\u201cBlack Russian\u201d), led to \nhis arrest on several occasions starting in 1990. In early April 1990, Applicant got into an \nargument at a local restaurant with two vacationers. A local police officer working an off-\nduty detail advised Applicant not to drive because he exhibited signs of being under the \ninfluence of alcohol. Applicant refused to leave the premises in a cab, and he was arrested \n\n \n \n4 \nfor disorderly conduct and detained overnight. The case was eventually dropped. (Ex. 4, \n14; Tr. 89-90, 96-98.) Three days after his arrest for disorderly conduct, Applicant was \nstopped for squealing his tires. He threatened the officer, attempted to flee, and then \nrepeatedly struck the officer on being detained. Charged with felony battery on a law \nenforcement officer, misdemeanor fleeing or eluding an officer, and a traffic infraction \n(failure to exhibit an operator\u201fs license), Applicant faced a maximum sentence of five years \nin prison. (Ex. 12.) Applicant refused to post bond on his arrest, and pending his \nappearance on the more serious charges, he was fined $70 in July 1990 for not posting \nbond and improper start. (Ex. 12,13.) In August 1990, he pleaded no contest to the April \ncharges pursuant to a plea agreement, and was sentenced to three days served on the \nfleeing/eluding charge and the traffic infraction. Adjudication was withheld on the felony \nbattery charge, and he was placed on probation for 18 months. On Applicant\u201fs motion, his \nprobation was terminated early in May 1991. (Ex. 4, 11, 12.) Applicant was required to \nabstain from alcohol and illegal drugs during his probation. (Ex. 12.) Applicant has no recall \nof the offense but surmises that he had to have been drunk because he would never have \ncommitted the crime otherwise. (Tr. 114.) \n \nIn March 1995, he was charged with breach of peace and misdemeanor criminal \ntrespass at a casino. The breach of peace charge was not prosecuted, but he was \nsentenced to one year, suspended, for criminal trespass. (Ex. 2, 4.) He claims that he did \nnot know that he had been banned from the premises. There were so many incidents at \nthe casino that he cannot now recall why he was banned. (Tr. 86.) The available evidence \ndoes not clearly indicate that alcohol was involved, although Applicant testified that he has \nconsumed alcohol at the casino while gambling, in quantity depending on how many hours \nhe was there. (Tr. 87.) In early April 1995, he was charged with misdemeanor leaving the \nscene of an accident with property damage in his home town. He pleaded no contest and \nwas placed on one year probation with court costs. (Ex. 9.) In April 1995, Applicant was \narrested for operating under the influence (DUI), first offense, and chemical test refusal. In \nJune 1995, the DUI charge was dismissed, but he was convicted of refusing to take the \nchemical test. (Ex. 6.) \n \nAfter his DUI charge in late April 1995, he stayed out of trouble until October 26, \n2000, when he was again arrested at the casino for criminal trespass. He was convicted on \nApril 12, 2001, and sentenced to one year in jail, suspended, given a conditional discharge \nfor two years, and ordered to stay out of the casino. (Ex. 2, 4, 8, 13.) \n \nMore recently, in May 2006, Applicant was arrested in his hometown for leaving the \nscene of an accident with property damage. Applicant had consumed a couple of drinks at \nhis then girlfriend\u201fs house. En route home, he claims he just touched the back bumper of a \ncar, but he admits he left the scene because he had been drinking. (Tr. 80-83.) He was \nordered in early July 2006 to pay a $500 fine, costs, and restitution. A warrant was issued \nfor his failure to pay, but it was withdrawn in April 2007 when he paid in full. (Ex. 2, 7.) \n \nIn early July 2006, Applicant consumed at least ten drinks of tequila over the course \nof nine hours while at the beach and a local strip club. Late in the evening, he was arrested \nfor DUI, first offense, chemical test refusal, and operating an unregistered vehicle. He lost \n\n \n \n5 \nhis driver\u201fs license for three months, was fined $2,000, and was ordered to perform ten \nhours of community service and complete alcohol counseling for refusing to submit to a \nchemical test. The DUI and unregistered vehicle charges were dismissed. (Ex. 2, 4, 5; Tr. \n75-.77, 112-13.) Applicant has not consumed tequila since that incident and does not \nintend to consume tequila in the future. (Tr. 77.) He was so drunk that day that he has no \nmemory of the arrest. (Tr. 113-14.) \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant consumed five Black Russians at a local casino. He was \nescorted out of the casino by security after he got involved in an altercation with a woman. \nHe informed security that he did not feel he should be driving because he had been \ndrinking, but he was told he had to leave. As he drove off the property, he was arrested for \nDUI. The court ordered him into counseling and accepted the program he was required to \nattend for the July 2006 DUI. (Ex. 2; Tr. 70-73.) Applicant attended group and individual \ncounseling from December 14, 2006 until April 11, 2007, for diagnosed alcohol abuse, \nalthough he was unaware at that time of any formal diagnosis. (Tr. 67.) At discharge, he \nwas given a good prognosis provided he stayed out of high risk situations. Applicant \ninformed his clinician that he had learned his lesson and would not again drink and drive. \n(Ex. 2.) Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was recommended to him as a possible benefit, but he \nchose not to go to AA. (Tr. 68.) \n \nApplicant did not require a security clearance when he started working for his \ncurrent employer in 1998, although he was put on notice of, and agreed to abide by, his \nemployer\u201fs policy prohibiting the use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 58.) At his employer\u201fs request, \nApplicant applied for a Secret security clearance on July 17, 2008. On his e-QIP, he \nresponded \u201cYes\u201d to question 23.d, concerning whether he had ever been charged or \nconvicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. He listed only the July 2006 DUI, \nhaving deliberately elected to omit his arrest for DUI in August 2006 because he felt the \nincident was ridiculous and he had been set up. (Ex. 2; Tr. 101, 104.) Applicant has no \nexplanation for why he did not list his 1995 DUI other than he filled out the form in haste \nand did not pay as much attention as he should have when completing the form. (Ex. 2.) \nApplicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to questions 23.a (\u201cHave you ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any felony offense?\u201d) and 23.f (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested \nfor, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e \nabove?\u201d). He did not recall ever being arrested for a felony (Tr. 99.), and had no \nexplanation for why he did not list his May 2006 arrest for leaving the scene of an accident \nother than he did not take acquiring his security clearance seriously enough. (Tr. 105-06.)  \n \nThe day after he executed his e-QIP in July 2008, Applicant\u201fs long-time girlfriend \ndied unexpectedly. (Ex. 2; Tr. 47.) Applicant, who had used marijuana sporadically over the \nyears when he felt like it (Tr. 54-61.),1 purchased marijuana for $20 and he smoked it in \nabout August 2008. (Ex. 2.) \n                                                 \n1Applicant provided varying accounts of his involvement with marijuana between 1985 and August 2008. \nThere is no evidence he used it on a regular basis, but it is likely he used it more often than once or twice \nduring that period. He had told a government investigator in September 2008 that he had bought the \nmarijuana that he used on the death of his girlfriend from an acquaintance, and that he had used not any \nmarijuana in 15 years until then. (Ex. 2.) In response to interrogatories, Applicant indicated in January 2009 \n\n \n \n6 \n \nOn September 16, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator \nabout his use of alcohol, his DUI and other criminal offenses, his alcohol counseling, and \nhis use of marijuana after he had filled out his e-QIP. Concerning his marijuana use, \nApplicant reported smoking marijuana in the past but not within the past 15 years until \nthree weeks before, when he purchased $20 worth of marijuana from an acquaintance and \nsmoked the drug on the death of his girlfriend. He indicated he had no intent to smoke \nmarijuana on a regular basis in the future, but that he might use it in the future despite its \nillegality if he felt like it. Applicant admitted he drank primarily Black Russian cocktails in no \nset pattern, but he indicated he was careful about not driving after drinking. Applicant \npersisted in denying any recollection of ever having been charged with a felony, even after \nbeing told of the assault on a police officer charge. He denied any misdemeanor charges in \nthe last ten years other than minor traffic tickets. (Ex. 2.) \n  \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant related that he had been drinking \nmonthly, but he stopped drinking since his girlfriend died. However, he also indicated that \nhe might drink in the future at a dinner party or social occasion, although not like he had in \nthe past. Concerning marijuana, he indicated that he \u201ctried it for a short period and it just \nmade [him] tired. It is only asking for trouble.\u201d He claimed he decided to stop using \nmarijuana shortly after 1985 or 1986 because it wasn\u201ft for him. As for his use and purchase \nof marijuana, Applicant admitted his involvement when his girlfriend passed away, which \nhe described as a \u201crare incident.\u201d Applicant added that he believed he was in an \nenvironment or situation where others were using drugs, he would leave. (Ex. 2.) \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant admitted he had used marijuana after 1985 or 1986 \nsporadically (\u201cIt may be once every two years, every five years.\u201d) and purchasing the drug \nmore than once during that time. (Tr.  50-51.) He offered no explanation for why he did not \nadmit to that use during his interview or in his response to interrogatories (Tr. 54-55.), but \ndenied that he withheld the information. As for whether he intended to use marijuana in the \nfuture despite signing his employer\u201fs drug policy and applying for a security clearance, \nApplicant testified that many employees with red badges at his employment smoke \nmarijuana, and that he was not going to lie and state that he would not smoke marijuana in \nthe future. (Tr. 58-60.) He saw no problem with smoking marijuana to relax at home while \nwatching television, but he would not use marijuana while out driving or at work. (Tr. 60.) \nApplicant does not intend to use marijuana regularly (\u201cIt\u201fs not as though I\u201fm going to smoke \n                                                                                                                                                             \nthat he decided to stop using marijuana \u201cshortly after 1985-86\u201d because it was not for him. (Ex. 2.) He \ndescribed his use of marijuana on the death of his girlfriend as \u201ca rare incident\u201d and that he found himself in an \nenvironment where others were using drugs around him, he would leave. (Ex. 2.) At his hearing, he claimed to \nnot recall the number of times he used or purchased it other than he bought the drug more than once, and he \nused it sporadically before his girlfriend\u201fs death \u201cmaybe once or twice\u201d if he \u201cran into somebody, if somebody \noffered it to [him].\u201d (Tr. 51-52.) He testified that he obtained the drug from persons he did not know (\u201cmaybe \nthey were talking with somebody else, and [he] may have seen it. Maybe [he] went up to them.\u201d). (Tr. 53.) He \nadmitted at his hearing that he enjoyed the feeling marijuana gives him \u201con occasions,\u201d and that he used the \ndrug at home \u201con occasion.\u201d (Tr. 61-62.) He could not rule out using the drug in the future if he felt like it (\u201cI \ndon\u201ft agree with kids, 15-16 and whatever, smoking and doing whatever because their brain to me just can\u201ft \nhandle it. For somebody like myself, if I\u201fm at home and I\u201fm watching television, and I want to do that, I can do \nit.\u201d (Tr. 60.) \n\n \n \n7 \nmarijuana all the time. It could happen, and then I could not use it for two years, or \nwhatever. It\u201fs just if I feel.\u201d). (Tr. 62.) \n \nApplicant does not believe he has ever had an alcohol problem. (Tr. 65, 112.) As of \nlate May 2010, he was drinking between two to four or five glasses of wine or Black \nRussians while out at a local racetrack on Friday or Saturday nights, drinking on the higher \nend only if he was there for a lengthy period. He was not consuming alcohol at home or \nduring the work week. (Tr. 68-70.) Applicant is careful not to drink and drive after drinking \nmore than a couple of glasses of wine or Black Russians. (Tr. 78.) He enjoys his job and \nhas not had any incidents at work related to alcohol or illegal drug use. (Tr. 115.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u201eright\u201f to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u201fs suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u201fs eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u201fs overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \n\n \n \n8 \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See \nalso EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nThe concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u201fs reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nAlcohol was involved in most of Applicant\u201fs criminal offenses, including some for \nwhich he did not face an alcohol-related charge (e.g., the April 5, 1990 disorderly conduct). \nWhile he does not now recollect the circumstances of the April 8, 1990 felony battery \noffense, he indicates that he must have been intoxicated since the offense was out of \ncharacter for him. He also admits that he had been drinking before the May 2006 leaving \nthe scene of an accident, although there is no proof that he was intoxicated. His April 1995, \nJuly 2006, and August 2006 DUI offenses clearly implicate AG \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether \nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c), \n\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d applies \nbecause of his consumption of ten or so tequila drinks before his July 2006 DUI. Moreover, \nwhereas he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse by licensed chemical dependency \ncounselors on staff of the alcohol program he attended from December 14, 2006, to April \n11, 2007, AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d \nalso applies. \n \n \nGiven the long span over which Applicant allowed alcohol to negatively affect his \njudgment, it is difficult to apply mitigating condition AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, \nor the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u201fs current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d despite the passage of more than 3.5 years since his \nlast DUI. Applicant\u201fs refusal to acknowledge the diagnosis of alcohol abuse does not \npreclude favorable consideration of AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her \nalcoholism or issues of abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible \nuse (if an alcohol abuser),\u201d where he understands his drunk driving was serious and he no \nlonger drives after drinking to excess.  Applicant\u201fs successful completion of court-ordered \nalcohol counseling with a good prognosis is evidence of action taken to overcome his \nproblem. Although not entitled to the same weight in mitigation than had he volunteered for \n\n \n \n9 \nalcohol treatment, the good prognosis shows he was receptive to counseling. As for \ndemonstrating the pattern of responsible use required of persons with diagnosed alcohol \nabuse, Applicant has no more than two drinks if he is going to drive. He consumes as \nmany as four or five \u201cBlack Russians\u201d on occasion while gambling at the racetrack or \ncasino, but only if he plans to stay there for an extended period. The absence of any \nevidence of alcohol-related impairment since August 2006 is consistent with a moderation \nof his consumption. \n \nApplicant has the counseling and favorable prognosis required for mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 23(d): \n \nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling \nor rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in \nmeetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has \nreceived a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program. \n \nYet he lacks affiliation with a support network like AA. Although AA was recommended to \nhim (\u201cThey said if [he] wanted to go, it would probably be good to go\u201d) (Tr. 68.), there is no \nevidence that it was a required component of his aftercare. Under those circumstances, AG \n\u00b6 23(d) applies despite his failure to attend AA or similar organization. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an illegal \ndrug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u201fs reliability \nand trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u201fs ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 24(a), drugs are defined as \u201cmood and behavior altering substances,\u201d \nand include: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens),2 and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 24(b), drug abuse is defined as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a \nlegal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n                                                 \n2Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. \n\n \n \n10 \n \nApplicant began using marijuana in 1985. When he was arrested for threatening a \ngas station attendant in May 1985, he had a small quantity of marijuana in his possession. \nHe used marijuana sporadically thereafter, including in July or August 2008 after his \ngirlfriend died. He purchased marijuana as well, at a frequency that he described as more \nthan once. Applicant bought about $20 worth after his girlfriend died. Whether or not he \npurchased the marijuana from an acquaintance (Ex. 2.) or from a stranger on the street (Tr. \n53.), he knew that marijuana was an illegal drug (Tr. 56.) and that it was against his \nemployer\u201fs drug policy. (Tr. 58.) AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug \npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; \nor possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d apply. Furthermore, when asked about his future \nintent, Applicant was not willing to state that he would not use marijuana again if he felt like \nit, even after he was reminded of his employer\u201fs policy prohibiting illegal drug use. AG \u00b6 \n25(h), \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly \ncommit to discontinue drug use,\u201d also applies. Disregard of the law raises considerable \ndoubts about a person\u201fs judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nThe details of Applicant\u201fs illegal drug use are not fully known to the Government. \nApplicant was reluctant to estimate the extent of his marijuana use other than to indicate \nthat it was sporadic. But he also admitted that he enjoyed the drug\u201fs relaxing effects, and \nthat he saw no problem with using it at home while watching television. Also, if he \npurchased marijuana from strangers on the street, one has to question how he knew where \nto acquire the marijuana. His enjoyment and purchase suggest a level of marijuana \ninvolvement greater than the one or two times total between 1985 and July/August 2008. \nFurthermore, assuming his marijuana involvement was infrequent, AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u201fs current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably apply when he is unwilling \nto commit himself to abstain from marijuana. None of the mitigating conditions are fully \nestablished. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in Guideline J, AG \u00b6 30: \n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u201fs judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u201fs ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nApplicant has a long history of an inability or unwillingness to conform his behavior \nto the law. While the July 2006 DUI charge was dismissed, he does not dispute that he \ndrank to excess before his arrest. He disputes the August 2006 DUI, claiming that he was \nset up, but the undisputed facts are that he operated a vehicle after he had too much to \ndrink. In May 2006, he drove off after striking another car because he had been drinking. \nAssuming Applicant was unaware that he had been banned by the casino in March 1995, \nhis arrest for criminal trespass should have given him reason to avoid the casino or at least \ndetermine whether he was still banned from the premises before going there in October \n\n \n \n11 \n2000. Police and court records substantiate that Applicant hit a law enforcement officer in \nApril 1990. While adjudication was withheld on the felony charge of battery on a law \nenforcement officer, AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted,\u201d still applies to \nthat offense. AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 \n31(c) are also applicable. \n \nNone of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 apply. Although more \nthan three years have passed since Applicant\u201fs last arrest, his purchase and use of \nmarijuana in July or August 2008 constitute recent illegal behavior. Moreover, given his \nexpressed enjoyment of the illegal drug and unwillingness to commit to abstention, I cannot \nreasonably conclude that his criminal conduct is not likely to recur. AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much \ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u201fs \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is not implicated. While Applicant shows \nsome rehabilitation of his alcohol-related offenses, most notably the successful completion \nof outpatient treatment, it is not enough to dispel the lingering concerns about his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness raised by his persistent disregard for the laws \nprohibiting the abuse of controlled substances. Moreover, it is also difficult to apply AG \u00b6 \n32 (d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d in \nlight of his deliberate misrepresentations on his July 2008 e-QIP (see Guideline E). The \ndeliberate falsification of his e-QIP is punishable as a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.3 \nAlthough not cited in the SOR, I note Congress has recognized the importance of accurate \ninformation being provided to the government.4 \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u201fs reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \n                                                 \n3Title 18, Section 1001 of the United States Code provides in pertinent part: \n \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the \njurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United \nStates, knowingly and willfully - (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or \ndevice a material fact; (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or \nrepresentation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to \ncontain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry; shall be fined under \nthis title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the offense involves international or \ndomestic terrorism (as defined in section 2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both.  \n \n4 See footnote 5. \n\n \n \n12 \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant admits that he omitted his August 2006 DUI arrest from his e-QIP because \nhe felt the charge was not justified (\u201cthe incident was ridiculous,\u201d Ex. 2.), and he felt he had \nbeen set up. He was required to report that arrest in response to question 23.f concerning \nany offenses in the last seven years, if not question 23.d, asking about any charges related \nto alcohol or drugs. His deliberate omission implicates disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, \nor award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant has denied intentional concealment of his other offenses, including his \nMay 1985 possession of marijuana, April 1990 felony battery, April 1995 DUI, and May \n2006 criminal trespass. During his September 2008 interview with a Government \ninvestigator, he recalled that he was arrested about ten years ago for DUI, and that he \n\u201cmay have had a small amount of marijuana in the lid of a shaving cream can\u201d during an \nincident at a gas station. He denied any recollection of a marijuana possession charge, of \nany felony charges at any time, and of any misdemeanor charges within the past ten years \nexcept for two or three minor traffic tickets. He attributed his omission of recalled offenses \nto having filled out his e-QIP quickly and not giving it the attention he should have. (Ex. 2.) \nAt his hearing, he denied any concern that the Government would find out about his \nomitted offenses. When pressed for an explanation for the omissions, Applicant initially \nresponded that he \u201cmaybe didn\u201ft take this red badge too seriously.\u201d He later indicated that \nhe likely could not recall the incidents because he was drunk at the time of his arrests. (Tr. \n106-07.)  Given the extent of Applicant\u201fs criminal record, and the dated nature of some of \nthe charges, I accept that he lacked full recall of some of the incidents and charges filed \nagainst him. That said, it is difficult to believe that he would not recall pleading no contest \nto battery on a law enforcement officer, given he could have been sentenced for up to five \nyears in prison and he was placed on probation for 18 months for the offense. His omission \nof the May 2006 leaving the scene of an accident was also likely intentional, given its \nrelative recency respective to the e-QIP and his ability to recall the specifics of the offense. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies to these omissions as well. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted,\u201d is partially applicable in that \nApplicant \u201creported\u201d during his September 2008 interview his unlisted August 2006 DUI \narrest, and acknowledged that he had deliberately omitted it from his e-QIP. But I cannot \nfully apply this mitigating condition where he maintained during that same interview that \nother than the two DUIs in 2006, he had only two or three minor traffic tickets within the \npast ten years. The May 2006 leaving the scene of an accident cannot reasonably be \ndescribed as a minor traffic ticket, especially where a warrant was issued for his arrest for \nfailure to pay court ordered fines, costs, and restitution. Moreover, he was not completely \n\n \n \n13 \ncandid about his marijuana involvement either during his subject interview or in his January \n2009 response to interrogatories. (Tr. 53-54.) He falsely claimed in January 2009 that he \nhad tried marijuana in 1985 or 1986 but abstained thereafter until after the death of his \ngirlfriend in 2008. His misrepresentations in response to DOHA interrogatories and during \nhis subject interview could have been alleged under Guideline E. See AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and \n16(b) (stating, \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant \nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other \nofficial government representative\u201d). Because the Government did not allege any \nfalsification of Applicant\u201fs interview or interrogatories, these misrepresentations cannot \nprovide an independent basis for denial of his security clearance However, they are \nrelevant in assessing the extent of his reform of his e-QIP omissions.5 \n \n \nBy signing the e-QIP, Applicant certified that his statements on the form were \u201ctrue, \ncomplete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief and [were] made in good \nfaith.\u201d He was put on notice that a knowing and willful false statement on the form could be \npunished by a fine or imprisonment or both under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. His knowing omission \nof the August 2006 DUI is enough to preclude me from considering AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u201fs reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He shows little to no \nremorse for his false statements, so I also cannot apply AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other \npositive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.\u201d The personal conduct concerns are not completely mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u201fs eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \n                                                 \n5In ISCR Case No. 03-020327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in \nwhich conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u201fs credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u201fs evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive \nSection 6.3. \n \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. \n24, 2003)). I have considered the non-SOR misconduct for the five above purposes and not for any other \npurpose. \n\n \n \n14 \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u201fs age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nApplicant admits he engaged in \u201cpetty, minor, little crazy stuff\u201d when he was \nyounger, and that he was so drunk in July 2006 that has no memory of the arrest itself. (Tr. \n113-14.) While he realized on the occasion of his August 2006 that he was too intoxicated \nto drive safely, he still got behind the wheel of his car after casino security told him he had \nto leave. To his credit, he successfully completed his alcohol counseling and has not \nallowed his use of alcohol to negatively affect his judgment thereafter. But he has shown \nlittle reform of his illegal drug abuse. Although it was made abundantly clear to Applicant at \nhis hearing that he is not allowed to smoke marijuana while holding a security clearance, \nApplicant is unwilling to commit himself to abstention from future marijuana use. He sees \nlittle wrong with using marijuana in his own home when he wants to. Applicant has made a \nchoice that is incompatible with the fiduciary obligations of a security clearance. Due to the \ndrug involvement, criminal conduct, and personal conduct concerns detailed above, I \ncannot conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n\n \n \n15 \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owes delinquent debt totaling about $14,000. While he was on active\nduty in the U.S. military in 2003, he was punished under Article 15 for unauthorized use\nof a government credit card. In November 2002, he forged and negotiated personal\nchecks totaling $5,350 from a fellow service member. In June 2004, he was convicted\nby a civilian court of depositing insufficient funds checks. His efforts to address his\ndelinquent debt are not enough to overcome the concerns for his financial judgment.\nClearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on April 2, 2008. On February 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its preliminary decision\nto deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\nAugust 31, 2009\n\nPresumably due to administrative error, there is no 1.w in the SOR.\n1\nApplicant denies that he held a security clearance while he was in the military (Tr. 35). A military\n2\npolice report indicates that Applicant held a secret clearance (Ex. 2).\n2\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective\nwithin the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn February 25, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and he requested a\ndecision without a hearing. On March 19, 2009, Applicant elected a hearing, and the\ncase was assigned to me on April 29, 2009. On May 8, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for\nMay 29, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Nine government exhibits (Ex. 1-9) and\ntwo Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-B) were admitted without any objections, and Applicant\ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 8, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed\ndelinquent debts totaling $17,219 (SOR 1.a-dd ); that he was punished under Article 15\n1\nof the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in February 2003 for unauthorized use of\na government credit card (SOR 1.ee); that he stole personal checks from another\nservice member in April 2003, and forged and negotiated checks in the total amount of\n$5,350 (SOR 1.ff); and that he was convicted in June 2004 by a civil court of deposit\naccount fraud/bad checks of $499 or less (SOR 1.gg). Applicant admitted several debts\nin the SOR, including 1.i-1k, 1.r, and 1.aa, which he averred had been paid. He denied\nthe debts in SOR 1.h, 1.p, 1.q, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.bb. Applicant did not deny the financial\nfraud alleged in SOR 1.ee\u20131.gg, although he averred that the $5,350 in forged checks\nhad not cleared and that he was unaware of his June 2004 conviction of deposit\naccount fraud because he was in Iraq. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old quality control manager, who has worked for his\npresent employer, a defense contractor, since March 2008 (Ex. 1, Tr. 30-31). He seeks\na security clearance for his employment (Tr. 35).  \n2\nApplicant and his first wife had a son in 1996 when they were both teenagers.\nAfter Applicant graduated from high school in June 1998, he and his first wife gave\ntemporary custody of their son to her mother so that they could join the military.\nApplicant entered on active duty in July 1998. He and his spouse provided financial\nassistance for their son until January 2000, when they married and regained full custody\nof their child (Ex. 1, Tr. 33). Applicant and his first wife lived off base in rental housing\nfrom February 2000 to June 2000. In October 2000, Applicant was sent overseas for a\nthree-year tour of duty (Tr. 32). He lived in military barracks with the exception of six\nmonths in 2001 when he lived on the local economy (Ex. 1).\n\nApplicant testified he was unaware of the bad check charge because he had been in Iraq. During a\n3\nsubsequent trip back to the U.S., he was stopped in customs for outstanding warrants for his arrest (Tr. 47-\n48), including for criminal trespass where he had broken a windshield (Exs. 2, 4, Tr. 49). He was convicted\nof one count of criminal trespass in August 2005 (Ex. 4).\n3\nApplicant failed to make timely payments on some loans (SOR 1.s, 1.t) and on a\nline of credit account (SOR 1.m) when he was overseas, in part because he was\nrequired to repay about $5,500 in public assistance that his mother-in-law had received\nfrom the state for the care of his son. That debt was repaid through garnishment of his\nmilitary wages (Exs. 1, 5).\nIn November 2002, while temporarily in the U.S. for basic noncommissioned\nofficer schooling, Applicant took leave over the Thanksgiving holiday. He had a ride with\nsomeone who got into an accident. To make sure that he arrived back at the base for\nhis schooling, Applicant purchased an airplane ticket using his government-sponsored\ncredit card (Tr. 35-36). He had also used the government credit card for some meals on\nthe local economy and some personal items while he was in the U.S. for military\nschooling (Tr. 39). In February 2003, he received non-judicial punishment for his misuse\nof a government credit card. He was awarded a reduction in rank (suspended) and extra\nduty. When he failed to repay the credit charges of $600 or $700 (Tr. 37) within the time\nallotted, the military reduced Applicant from E-6 to E-5 (Ex. 1, Tr. 32, 36). Applicant\ncould not afford to repay the debt in part because his pay was being garnished for the\nwelfare payments (Tr. 38).\nIn April 2003, Applicant stole some personal checks from another service\nmember. He forged this service member\u2019s signature and negotiated three checks that\nhe made out to himself in the aggregate amount of $5,350. Applicant deposited the\nchecks into his account over multiple days (Ex. 3, Tr. 41-44). The checks cleared and\nApplicant spent the funds (Tr. 44). During an investigation by the criminal investigation\ncommand in October 2003, Applicant admitted the theft, forgery, and negotiation of the\nchecks in order to pay his bills and care for his family (Ex. 3, Tr. 46). Applicant testified\nhe was not punished for the offense after he told the military investigators that he had\nreceived non-judicial punishment for his misuse of the government credit card (Tr.45).\nIn May 2003, Applicant was transferred to a base in the U.S. His financial\nproblems continued. The debts in SOR 1.q and 1.r were charged off and placed for\ncollection. In October 2003, Applicant\u2019s automobile was repossessed with about $4,500\nowed on his loan (not alleged). During February and March 2004, charges related to\ninsufficient funds checks (SOR 1.c-1.f and 1.y), and a $950 delinquent loan (SOR 1.b)\nwere placed for collection (Exs. 1, 5, 6, 7).\nIn May 2004, Applicant was discharged from the U.S. military. Within a week, he\nstarted working for a defense contractor in Iraq as a petroleum laboratory technician at\n$84,000 annually (Tr. 21, 48, 88). On May 10, 2004, Applicant was charged by civilian\nauthorities in the U.S. with two counts of misdemeanor deposit account fraud/bad\nchecks $499 or less (Ex. 4). On June 16, 2004, Applicant was convicted of the charges\n(Ex. 4).3\n\nApplicant and his spouse had a daughter in June 2007 (Ex. 1), and the medical debt in SOR 1.x is\n4\nfrom her birth (Tr. 58-60).\n4\nApplicant took his new job for the income to pay his debts, which were due in\nlarge part to insufficient funds checks (Ex. 1). Yet accounts went unpaid, including a\n$325 debt owed to a check cashing service (SOR 1.cc) and cellular phone charges of\n$342 (SOR  1.h). He issued bad checks to a retailer (SOR 1.i-1.k) (Exs. 5, 6), and in the\nsummer of 2005, two debts owed the commissary from August 2000 (SOR 1.n, 1.o)\nwere referred for collection (Exs. 5, 6, 7).\nApplicant married his current spouse in January 2006. He came to the United\nStates from Iraq for their wedding, which cost him between $12,000 and $15,000 (Tr.\n73). In April 2006, they spent their honeymoon in Dubai at a cost of about $10,000 (Ex.\n1, Tr. 73-74). In June 2006, Applicant and his spouse took out a joint automobile loan of\n$25,196. The following month, they financed a second car through a loan of $24,547\n(Ex. 7), to be repaid at $563 per month for 74 months (Ex. A). They paid off the first loan\nin January 2008 and took out a new loan of $36,000 with the same lender (Ex. 7), to be\nrepaid at $756 per month for 72 months (Ex. A). They made timely payments on the car\nloans, while other accounts held by Applicant individually were referred for collection\n(SOR 1.a, 1.g, 1.x, 1.z)  (Ex. 6).\n4\nIn March 2008, Applicant left his job and $120,000 annual salary (Tr. 88) and\nstarted a new job in the U.S. with his present employer (Ex. 1, Tr. 30-31). The debt in\nSOR 1.v (duplicated in 1.bb) was placed for collection that month (Ex. 7). On April 2,\n2008, he executed an e-QIP and disclosed the non-judicial punishment in 2003 for\nunauthorized purchases on a government-sponsored credit card, the repossession of\nhis vehicle in 2003, and the garnishment of his wages to repay public assistance taken\nby his former mother-in-law while she cared for his son. In response to the financial\ndelinquency inquiries in section 28, Applicant listed several debts (SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.f,\n1.h, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.q, 1.r (satisfied), 1.v, 1.aa, 1.cc, and 1.dd), including two unpaid\nloans of $1,080 and $3,235 that were not alleged in the SOR. He explained that debts\nhad not been paid because he was in Iraq for the past four years and had not yet had\nthe opportunity to contact his creditors. He cited his purchase of three vehicles since\nmid-2006 on which he had not missed a payment as indication that he now understands\n\u201cthe importance of making wise decisions and the impact poor financial decisions has\non one\u2019s credibility and character.\u201d He expressed an intent to satisfy his outstanding\ndebts (Ex. 1).\nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator about his delinquent\ndebt on May 16, 2008. He admitted that several accounts were past due because of\noverspending and poor financial decisions. He claimed not to have known of the extent\nof his indebtedness until he reviewed his credit report. Applicant remembered that he\nhad written bad checks in 2004, but he denied any knowledge of any charges filed\nagainst him in May 2004 (Ex. 9).\nSubsequent credit checks in August 2008 (Ex. 6) and December 2008 (Ex. 5)\nconfirmed that Applicant was continuing to make his car payments on time, but he had\n\n5\nreportedly made little to no progress toward resolving the delinquent debts on his credit\nrecord (Ex. 5, 6). He was $535 over the limit on a credit card account (SOR 1.l) (Ex. 5),\nand a $1,035 balance was subsequently charged off and placed for collection (Ex. A).\nIn late summer 2008, Applicant began paying $50 per month on the debt in SOR\n1.b (Ex. B, Tr. 51). As of late May 2009, the balance had been reduced because of his\npayments to $449 (Ex. A, Tr. 51). On May 15, 2009, Applicant satisfied the debt in SOR\n1.n (Ex. B, Tr. 55). He made no payments on the undisputed debts in SOR 1.a, 1.c\u20131.g,\n1.l\u20131.m, 1.s\u20131.t, 1.x\u20131.z, and 1.cc\u20131.dd (Tr. 51-62). Concerning debts that he disputed,\nSOR 1.h (duplicated in 1.p) and 1.q were verified as valid (Tr. 52, 56-57). The creditor\nallegedly holding the debt in SOR 1.u had no record of the debt (Tr. 58-59). The debt in\nSOR 1.v (duplicated in 1.bb) had been removed from his credit report (Tr. 59, 61), but\nthe debt in SOR 1.o was still on his credit record. Applicant intended to accept a\nsettlement offer on SOR 1.l, but he had not paid the $575 as of late May 2009 (Tr. 54-\n55). Appellant continues to assert that the debts in SOR 1.i-1.k and 1.aa have been paid\n(Tr. 53, 60-61), although his May 2009 credit report does not show any payments (Ex.\nA).\nAs of May 2009, Applicant\u2019s car loans, on which he was paying $1,319 per\nmonth, and a deferred student loan from November 2004 were his only open current\naccounts (Ex. A). Applicant was paying between $300 and $400 per month toward\ndelinquent debts, including for cash advances that do not show up on his credit reports\n(Tr. 68). Applicant took out a cash advance to cover the spike in gasoline prices in\nsummer 2008 (Tr. 69). He was paying $50 per month toward a federal tax debt of about\n$4,100 as of May 2009. He owes state taxes of about $400 or $500 (Tr. 69-70).\nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is $107,000 (Tr. 88). His spouse works as a\nsecretary/administrative assistant for a private company. Their joint take-home pay is\nabout $7,800 per month (Tr. 66). Applicant estimates their joint net remainder to be\nabout $400 or $500 per month due to a recent pay raise that increased his net take-\nhome by $280 to $290 per paycheck (Tr. 75-76). Applicant is current in his child support\npayments for his son (Tr. 34). In addition to child support, he covers $460 in private\nschool tuition and $150 in orthodontic costs for his son each month (Tr. 65). Once his\ncash advance debts are satisfied in August 2009, he will have the funds to allot to other\ndebts (Tr. 72). Applicant acknowledges that he could have been more aggressive in\nresolving his old debts, but he wanted to make sure that he had some savings if he\nshould lose his job (Tr. 75, 83-84). Applicant now relies heavily on his debit card for any\npurchases (Ex. B, Tr. 86).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\n\n6\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n\n7\nWhile Applicant was in the U.S. military from July 1998 to May 2004, he\nexercised extremely poor financial judgment in writing checks knowing that he did not\nhave the funds to cover them, in taking cash advances beyond what he could\nreasonably afford, in spending about $5,350 in cash assets stolen from a fellow service\nmember by check fraud, in using a government-sponsored credit card for personal\nexpenses, and in falling delinquent on several loan accounts. With limited exception\n(SOR 1.r), he made little effort to address his consumer credit debts despite annual\nincome exceeding $80,000 since May 2004. Applicant owed about $14,350 in\ndelinquent debt balances as of December 2008, excluding the following: cash advance\ndebts that are not reflected in his credit reports; those debts that have been paid (SOR\n1.r, 1.aa); and those debts that have been removed from his credit record and not\nverified (SOR 1.u, 1.v.). Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6\n19(d), \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft,\ncheck fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan\nstatements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust,\u201d apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably be\napplied in mitigation. Although there is no evidence that Applicant has written any bad\nchecks in recent years, he exceeded his credit limit by $535 on a low limit credit card\naccount opened in November 2005 and then stopped payment on the balance (SOR\n1.l). He has yet to satisfy most of his delinquent debt.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies in limited part. Applicant had to\nrepay about $5,500 in welfare payments that his former mother-in-law received while\nshe had temporary custody of his son. The garnishment of his wages left him without\nthe income to meet his financial obligations, and it explains the reliance on cash\nadvances. However, it does not extenuate the knowing misuse of his government credit\ncard for personal items or his larceny of $5,350 from a fellow service member. Nor does\nit mitigate his delay in contacting his creditors and his continued inaction on many of his\ndelinquent balances. Applicant acknowledges that he could have acted more\naggressively to resolve his debts.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted tendency to put his personal interest first is evident in his\nexpenditure of $12,000 to $15,000 for his wedding and another $10,000 for his\nhoneymoon, and more recently in his financing of the purchase of two new cars.  He\ntook on car payments totaling $1,319 per month while creditors were not being repaid.\nHe is credited with making monthly payments on the debt in SOR 1.b since late summer\n2008, and in satisfying SOR 1.r in May 2007 and SOR 1.n in May 2009, but this is not\nenough to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n\n8\nAs of late May 2009, Applicant reported net discretionary funds of $400 or $500\neach month due to a recent pay raise that increased his net take-home by $280 to $290\nper paycheck. His checking account statement covering the last 90 days shows that he\nrelies heavily on his debit card for purchases, which is a favorable change in his\npersonal financial habits from when he wrote checks without regard to whether he had\nthe funds to cover them. His car loan payments have been timely. Yet his financial\nsituation has not been sufficiently resolved to where I can conclude it is under control.\nHe is making payments on cash advances that should be satisfied as of August 2009,\nbut he still owes back taxes of about $4,000 that take priority over the delinquent debts\nin the SOR. Under the circumstances presented, it would be premature to apply AG \u00b6\n20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d is implicated, but only in part. Concerning SOR 1.v (duplicated in 1.bb),\nApplicant did not recognize the debt when he was interviewed in May 2008 and it was\nremoved from his credit record after he disputed it. He indicated that the creditor in SOR\n1.u had no record of his debt. It appears on his credit record as a charged off credit card\nas of January 2002. In the absence of any recent proof that it is still owed, AG \u00b6 20(e)\napplies to SOR 1.u. Similarly, Applicant has consistently maintained that the debt in\nSOR 1.aa was paid by garnishment. As of April 2008, it was being reported as a $208\ndebt balance in collection (Ex. 7), but the debt is not listed on subsequent credit reports\n(Exs. 5, 6, A). However, Applicant\u2019s claimed satisfaction of the debts in SOR 1.i, 1.j, and\n1.k in 2000 is not sufficiently substantiated. His May 2009 credit report (Ex. A) indicates\nMarch 2004 as the date of first delinquency for those accounts, and they remain on his\ncredit report.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\n\n9\nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve\nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nApplicant became a father when he was a teenager. When he was not yet 18, he\nenlisted in the military, which showed some initiative on his part to make a better life for\nhimself and his family. Some financial over-extension and even his use of the\ngovernment credit card to buy a plane ticket so that he would return on time from leave\nare extenuated by immaturity, but the theft and negotiation of checks from another\nservice member raises very serious concerns about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. Those concerns are compounded by his failure to make concerted\nefforts to address his delinquent debts after he started working for a defense contractor\nat $84,000 a year. Some of his financial decisions, such as the financing of a 2008\nvehicle through a loan of $33,169 in January 2008, are difficult to justify when he owes\ndelinquent debt.\nI do not doubt the sincerity of his intent to resolve his debts. Applicant has been\nvery open about his financial situation and fraudulent financial activities. But he has yet\nto take sufficient steps to address most of the debts in the SOR, even knowing that his\nfinancial situation is of concern to the Department of Defense. In the absence of\nadequate assurances that the delinquent debts are likely to be resolved in the near\nfuture, I cannot conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aa:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.bb:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.cc:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.dd:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ee:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ff:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.gg:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $162 to $7,492 for a total of about $20,000. Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR were mixed and are set forth below. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 31-year-old security officer. He has held this job since April 2008. He married in 2004, and he and his wife are expecting their first child. His employment history includes military service during 1996\u20132003, when he served on active duty with the U.S. Coast Guard. Applicant is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for the first time. To this end, he completed a security-clearance application in April 2008, and he reported ten accounts in response to two questions about financial delinquencies. In total, he 3 reported about $10,000 in delinquent debts. Exhibits 6 and 7. 4 Exhibit 7. 5 Exhibit 5. 6 Exhibit 3. 7 Exhibits 3 and 5. 8 3 Credit reports from 2008 and 2009 establish (1) the debts alleged in the SOR, and (2) that Applicant has a history of financial problems. For example, the trade 4 section of the 2008 credit report has 27 accounts of which 14 are described as derogatory in some way (in collection, past due, etc.). The individual debts, as alleged 5 in the SOR, are addressed below. Applicant denies an unpaid $296 charged-off account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He contends the account was settled.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nThis is a security clearance case in which Applicant contests the Defense\nDepartment\u2019s intent to deny him eligibility for an industrial security clearance. The action\nis based on Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems or difficulties (delinquent debts).\nThe record contains insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security\nconcerns stemming from his history of financial problems, which are ongoing and\nunresolved. Accordingly, as explained in more detail below, this case is decided against\nApplicant. \nSeptember 11, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n2\nherein. \n Exhibit 4. \n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on April 22, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F for\nfinancial considerations. The SOR also recommended submitting the case to an\nadministrative judge for a determination to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 1, 2009, and he did not request a hearing.\nAccordingly, the case will be decided based on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nOn June 29, 2009, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant and received by him on July 16,\n2\n2009. He did not respond within the allowed 30-day period. The case was assigned to\nme on September 4, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts ranging in amounts\nfrom $162 to $7,492 for a total of about $20,000. Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR were\nmixed and are set forth below. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old security officer. He has held this job since April 2008.\nHe married in 2004, and he and his wife are expecting their first child. His employment\nhistory includes military service during 1996\u20132003, when he served on active duty with\nthe U.S. Coast Guard. \nApplicant is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for the first time. To\nthis end, he completed a security-clearance application in April 2008, and he reported\nten accounts in response to two questions about financial delinquencies.   In total, he\n3\nreported about $10,000 in delinquent debts.\n\n Exhibits 6 and 7. \n4\n Exhibit 7.\n5\n Exhibit 5. \n6\n Exhibit 3. \n7\n Exhibits 3 and 5.\n8\n3\nCredit reports from 2008 and 2009 establish (1) the debts alleged in the SOR,\nand (2) that Applicant has a history of financial problems.  For example, the trade\n4\nsection of the 2008 credit report has 27 accounts of which 14 are described as\nderogatory in some way (in collection, past due, etc.).  The individual debts, as alleged\n5\nin the SOR, are addressed below.\nApplicant denies an unpaid $296 charged-off account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He\ncontends the account was settled. In response to the Agency\u2019s interrogatories,\nApplicant presented (1) a settlement offer from a law firm for $445 payable by January\n16, 2009, (2) the name of the law firm, and (3) a named point-of-contact with telephone\nnumber as proof of payment.  Given these circumstances, coupled with the relatively\n6\nlow amount at issue, this debt is resolved.\nApplicant admits an unpaid $1,422 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. In\nresponse to the SOR, Applicant presented a settlement offer from a law firm, which\nagreed to settle the account for $710 in three payments starting in June 2009.7\nApplicant did not submit any other documentary proof for this debt. Given these\ncircumstances, this debt is unresolved.\nApplicant denies an unpaid $7,492 account charged-off account alleged in SOR\n\u00b6 1.c. He presented documentary proof that he settled this account for $6,000 in 2004.  \n8\nApplicant admits an unpaid $285 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. This\ndebt is unresolved.\nApplicant admits an unpaid $1,157 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He\nbelieves this is the same account as that alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l, which alleges the original\ncreditor for the amount of $1,156. This debt is unresolved, and it will not be discussed\nseparately as \u00b6 1.l. \nApplicant admits a past-due account in the amount of $1,225 for an auto loan\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. In his Answer, Applicant indicated he would bring the loan current\nby June 2009, but did not present any documentary proof of his actions. Given these\ncircumstances, this past-due account is unresolved.\nApplicant admits an unpaid $762 charged-off account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. In\nhis Answer, Applicant stated he had received an offer to settle the account for $500, but\n\n Exhibit 5. \n9\n Exhibit 5. \n10\n4\nhe has not presented any other evidence. Given these circumstances, this debt is\nunresolved.\nApplicant admits an unpaid $2,537 charged-off account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h.\nThis debt is unresolved.\nApplicant admits an unpaid $259 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. In his\nAnswer and in his response to the Agency\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant explained that he\nentered into a repayment plan or agreement with the collection agency in January 2009.\nHe made monthly payments and expected to make a final payment in June 2009. Given\nthese circumstances, coupled with the relatively low amount, this debt is resolved.\nApplicant denies an unpaid $162 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. In\nresponse to the Agency\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant explained that he settled this debt in\n2009 by making monthly payments in January, February, March, and April, but has not\nreceived written confirmation.  Given these circumstances, coupled with the relatively\n9\nlow amount at issue, this debt is resolved.\nApplicant admits an unpaid $797 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. This\ndebt is unresolved.\n Applicant admits an unpaid $2,893 medical account that was placed for\ncollection. Applicant has attempted over the years to have this paid through his wife\u2019s\nhealth-insurance provider without success. He is now trying to settle the account with\nthe collection agency. This debt remains unresolved.\n In his January 2009 response to interrogatories, Applicant attributed his financial\ndifficulties to using credit cards due to a combination of factors: (1) a move to another\nstate in 2004, followed by his marriage, followed by a brief period of unemployment,\nfollowed by a period of underemployment when he earned $7 per hour; (2) a new job as\na private investigator in 2005 when he had to pay for fuel expenses; (3) another job as a\nprivate investigator in 2006 with better pay but the same fuel expenses; (4) his current\njob beginning in 2008, which was a part-time position for the first three months, but has\nbeen a full-time position since July 2008; and (5) the loss of a roommate/tenant, which\nincreased the monthly rental payment.  Applicant believes he and his wife are now in a\n10\nbetter financial position, he knows he owes the money, and he wants to repay his debts.\n\n Department of Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n20\n5\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n11\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n12\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n13\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n14\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n15\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n16\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n17\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n18\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.19\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n21\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n22\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n23\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n24\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n25\n6\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n21\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n22\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n23\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nTo summarize, as set forth in the findings of fact, Applicant  resolved four debts\nand eight debts are unresolved for a total of about $11,000. These facts and\ncircumstances raise concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n24\n25\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n26\n7\nGuideline F. These facts and circumstances are more than sufficient to establish the\ntwo disqualifying conditions noted above, and it suggests financial irresponsibility as\nwell.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns as follows:  \n26\nThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nThe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol;\nThe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\nThe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nThe affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none, either individually\nor in combination, are sufficient to mitigate and overcome the security concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are longstanding going back to about 2004\u20132005. They\nare not minor, and they are ongoing and unresolved. He did not present evidence of a\nrealistic plan in place to address his remaining delinquent indebtedness and meet his\ncurrent financial obligations. The combination of factors Applicant points to as an\nexplanation for his financial problems are not so unusual or extraordinary to qualify as\ncircumstances largely beyond his control.  \nHe is entitled to some credit in mitigation, however, for his good-faith efforts in\nresolving four debts. This is a good first step in the right direction. But more than half of\nthe indebtedness is unresolved, and it appears it will remain so for some time. Looking\nforward, it is too soon to tell if Applicant will repay, settle, or otherwise resolve his\noutstanding delinquent debts in a reasonable time and then continue to be a financially-\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n27\n8\nresponsible person. These circumstances are plainly contrary to the clearly-consistent\nstandard I am required to apply. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nIn reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the nine-factor whole-person\nconcept.27\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d\u20131.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.i\u20131.j:\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.k, 1.l, 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.      \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

She has no association with the Iraqi government.10 \n \n \nApplicant has sent about $4,000 to his family in Iraq since about 1999. He sent \nabout $2,000 by traditional means. He sent about another $2,000 using an alternate \nsystem to traditional banking, sometimes referred to as the \u201chawala\u201d system. The \nhawala system is discussed below.11 \n \n \nApplicant does not own any foreign assets. He owns a rental property in the \nUnited States. He estimated the value of his U.S. assets at $120,000. He has voted in \nU.S. elections.12  \n \n \nApplicant is a valued and trusted employee. Several supervisors and military \npersonnel sent letters on his behalf attesting to his patriotism and loyalty to this country. \nHe is praised for his trustworthiness, professionalism, dedication, honesty, and integrity. \nHe has volunteered his time by giving speeches to help local schools and the \ncommunity. The character references recommend him for a security clearance.13   \n \nIraq  \n \nThe Iran-Iraq war (1980-88) devastated the economy of Iraq. Iraq declared \nvictory in 1988 but actually achieved a weary return to the status quo antebellum. The \nwar left Iraq with the largest military establishment in the Gulf region but with huge debts \nand an ongoing rebellion by Kurdish elements in the northern mountains. The \ngovernment suppressed the rebellion by using chemical and biological weapons on \ncivilian targets, including a mass chemical weapons attack on the Kurdish city of \nHalabja that killed several thousand civilians. \n \nIraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, but a U.S.-led coalition acting under United \nNations (UN) resolutions expelled Iraq in February 1991. After the war, Kurds in the \nnorth and Shi'a Muslims in the south rebelled against the government of Saddam \nHussein. The government responded quickly and with crushing force, killing thousands, \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n9 Tr. at 13, 113; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n10 Tr. at 79-93, 112-113; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-5. \n \n11 Tr. at 113-120; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n12 Tr. at 117-118, 121-123. \n \n13 AE A-D, J, K. \n\n \n5 \n \nand pursued damaging environmental and agricultural policies meant to drain the \nmarshes of the south. \n \nIn 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power \nin Iraq. Following the swift invasion and successful removal of Hussein\u2019s government \nfrom power, the United States endeavored to set a solid foundation of democratic \ninstitutions in Iraq. The Constitution in Iraq was ratified on October 15, 2005. After free \nelections in 2005, Iraq's new government, a parliamentary democracy, took office in \nMarch 2006.  \n \nIn 2007, 92% of Iraq\u2019s exports were in crude oil and crude oil materials. Almost \nhalf of Iraq\u2019s exports went to the United States. The United States\u2019 ultimate goal in Iraq \nis to establish a peaceful, united, stable, democratic, and secure nation that will be an \nally of the United States in the war against terrorism. The United States has invested \nthousands of lives and billions of dollars to assist in the reconstruction of Iraq. Success \nin Iraq is a high national priority of the United States. \n \nDespite the elections and new government, Baghdad, Mosul, and several other \nareas have especially serious problems with violent terrorists and insurgents. Although \nthere have been recent improvements in the security environment, Iraq remains \ndangerous, volatile, and unpredictable. Some areas of Iraq are more peaceful and less \nsusceptible to terrorist attacks than others; however, all areas of the country are still \nvery dangerous. Terrorists have the ability to strike most areas of the country with \nexplosive devices and mines. Numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the \nU.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with \naggressive governmental action against terrorists by U.S. and Iraqi forces, the threat of \nterrorism in Iraq remains very high. Terrorist groups can conduct intelligence activities \nas effectively as state intelligence services. \nHuman rights concerns include a climate of violence; misappropriation of official \nauthority by sectarian, criminal, and extremist groups; arbitrary deprivation of life; \ndisappearances; torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \npunishment; impunity; poor conditions in pretrial detention and prison facilities; denial of \nfair public trials; delays in resolving property restitution claims; immature judicial \ninstitutions lacking capacity; arbitrary arrest and detention; arbitrary interference with \nprivacy and home; other abuses in internal conflicts; limitations on freedoms of speech, \npress, assembly, and association due to sectarianism and extremist threats and \nviolence; restrictions on religious freedom; restrictions on freedom of movement; large \nnumbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees; lack of protection of \nrefugees and stateless persons; lack of transparency and widespread, severe \ncorruption at all levels of government; constraints on international organizations and \nnongovernmental organizations\u2019 (NGOs) investigations of alleged violations of human \nrights; discrimination against and societal abuses of women and ethnic and religious \nminorities; human trafficking; societal discrimination and violence against individuals \nbased on sexual orientation; and limited exercise of labor rights. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nHawala \nHawala is an alternative or parallel remittance system. It exists and operates \noutside of, or parallel to, \u201ctraditional\u201d banking or financial channels. It was developed in \nIndia, before the introduction of western banking practices, and is currently a major \nremittance system used around the world. It is but one of several such systems used \naround the world. These systems are often referred to as \u201cunderground banking\u201d; this \nterm is not always correct, as they often operate in the open with complete legitimacy, \nand these services are often heavily and effectively advertised. \nThe components of hawala that distinguish it from other remittance systems are \ntrust and the extensive use of connections such as family relationships or regional \naffiliations. Unlike traditional banking, hawala makes minimal (often no) use of any sort \nof negotiable instrument. Transfers of money take place based on communications \nbetween members of a network of hawaladars, or hawala dealers. \n \nHawala is used around the world to conduct legitimate remittances. Like any \nother remittance system, hawala can, and does, play a role in money laundering.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n7 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n8 \n \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife/fianc\u00e9e, brother, and two sisters are citizens and residents of \nIraq. His father is an Iraqi citizen. His father was granted permanent residence in the \nUnited States, but he has been in Iraq since 2006. The presence of Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate family members in Iraq creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. It also creates a potential conflict of \ninterest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s siblings in Iraq are married to Iraqi citizens. Applicant also has \ncousins that are Iraqi citizens and residents. Those extended family members do not \ncreate a potential conflict of interest or a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1k, and 1.l are \nconcluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nThere are no security concerns or disqualifying conditions raised by Applicant\u2019s \nsiblings who are Iraqi citizens and permanent residents of the United States. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.f are concluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nApplicant traveled to Iraq in 2005, 2007, and 2008 to visit family members. That \nhas no independent security significance.14 SOR \u00b6 1.n is concluded for Applicant.  \n \n  \nApplicant sent money to his family in Iraq. He sent about $2,000 through \ntraditional means and about $2,000 through an alternative remittance system \nsometimes referred to as hawala. There is no evidence that Applicant intended to \nlaunder any money in the transactions. There are no independent Foreign Influence \nsecurity concerns raised by the transactions. SOR \u00b6 1.m is concluded for Applicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n                                                          \n14 See ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). \n\n \n9 \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant has been in the United States since 1997, and he has been a U.S. \ncitizen since 2003. He has family members who performed mandatory military service in \nIraq. That does not mean they supported the Saddam Hussein regime. Two of his \nbrothers paid for their dissidence with their lives. Most of his family had to flee Iraq and \nlived in a refugee camp in Saudi Arabia until they immigrated to the United States. His \nbrother is showing his patriotism by serving in the Marine Corps. Applicant desires to \nserve this country in another capacity. Applicant is clearly a loyal U.S. citizen. However, \nhe has close family ties to Iraq, a country with continuing human rights concerns and \nthat is subject to widespread violence by various terrorist, insurgent, and criminal \nelements. I am unable to find any of the mitigating conditions to be fully applicable to the \nsecurity concerns related to his immediate family in Iraq.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. I also considered the \ntotality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq. Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to \nthe United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \n\n \n10 \n \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d15 The distinctions between \nfriendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution. Relations between \nnations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly \nnations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view \nas important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations \nhave engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in \nassessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. Also very important is whether the foreign country \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nIraq has human rights issues, and it has been victimized by terrorism. The \ncomplicated state of affairs in Iraq places a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his immediate family members in Iraq do not pose a \nsecurity risk. Applicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who is only seeking to aid this country. \nHowever, he was unable to mitigate the considerable security concerns raised by his \nfamily in Iraq. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.n: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n15 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\nsubmitted an undated response to the SOR that was notarized on February 17, 2009. She\nadmitted all allegations listed in the SOR and requested a decision based on the written\nrecord without a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 13,\n2009, that was mailed to Applicant on March 17, 2009.

She has three\nchildren, ages 22, 20 and 14.\nThe SOR lists 16 accounts that have been submitted for collection in the total\namount of $9,247, five accounts that have been charged off in the total amount of $1,921,\nand one account that has resulted in a judgment being entered against Applicant in the\namount of $1,251. Applicant admitted she was liable for each of these accounts. She did\nnot submit anything to indicate she has made any payment on any of these accounts.\nAdditionally, she disclosed in her e-QIP that two garnishment orders had been entered\nagainst her in the total amount of $4,669.08.\nMany of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts arise from credit card debt. Her credit\nbureau reports (CBR) disclose the date of last activity on most of the delinquent accounts\noccurred in either 2006 or 2007, although at least one dates back to 2004. As to one of the\ngarnishment orders entered against her, Applicant stated in her e-QIP that it arose from\na credit card debt that became delinquent in 1988 in the amount of $500 and has now risen\nto over $2,000. \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n3\nApplicant wrote in response to the FORM that she was trying to work with a credit\ncounseling agency in an effort to settle some of her debts. She also indicated she is paying\non the judgment that was entered against her. It is unclear from the FORM if that payment\nis from one of the garnishments she admitted had been entered against her. Her\nexplanation for the delinquent debt is the need to provide for her children and their father.\nApplicant acknowledged it will take some unspecified amount of time for her to be able to\nresolve the delinquent debt. \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id. at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant has at least 22 delinquent accounts, totalling over $12,000, that have been\neither charged off, submitted for collection or that resulted in a judgment being entered\nagainst her. Her CBRs disclose the last activity on those accounts occurred at least several\nyears ago. She acknowledged that one account dates back to a delinquent 1988 credit\ncard debt that has accumulated over $1,500 in additional interest and/or other charges\nover the years. Additionally, she has at least two outstanding garnishment orders that have\nbeen entered against her. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts; and DC 19C(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nThe only explanation Applicant provided for the delinquent debt is her need to\nprovide for her children and their father. However, the debt that she acknowledged which\ndates back to 1988 precedes the birth of two of her children. She listed continuous\nemployment dating back to 1998 in the e-QIP she submitted, with the exception of a nine-\nmonth period from August 2005 to May 2006 when she returned to school full-time. Her\nCBRs indicate she obtained at least one student loan during this time in the amount of\n$10,523. Additionally, Applicant provided no information about what efforts she may have\ntaken over the years to support her children and their father within the financial means\navailable to her from her employment and the student loans she took out. Finally, while\nApplicant stated in her response to the FORM that she was working with a credit counsellor\nin an effort to settle her debts, she provided no information as to what actions were actually\nbeing taken to resolve the debts or any basis to conclude that she will resolve the debts\nwith the service\u2019s assistance. \nI have considered Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted\n\n5\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and MC 20(c): the person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control and conclude they do not apply.\nThere is no record evidence to indicate any of the remaining mitigating conditions apply.\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis or her acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. She has not overcome the case against her\nnor satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-v:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Garcia, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Patrick McGuire, Esquire \n \n \n \n________________ \n \nDecision  \n________________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude \nthat Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under the guidelines for \nforeign influence and financial considerations. Accordingly, his request for a security \nclearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), signed on February 28, 2007. After reviewing the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nMay 17, 2010\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \n \nOn July 10, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that \nspecified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive under \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Applicant signed his notarized Answer to the SOR on \nAugust 25, 2009. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 22, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on January 4, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nJanuary 21, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 22, 2010. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, which were marked and \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. Applicant testified and offered 18 \nexhibits, which I marked and admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through R. I granted \nApplicant's request to hold the record open to submit additional documentation. He \ntimely submitted two documents, admitted without objection as AE S and T. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on February 25, 2010. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the government moved to amend the SOR as follows:  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the government moved to withdraw \nallegations 1.g. and 1.i., which were duplicates of \nallegations 1.e. and 1.f., respectively. \n \nThe SOR is so amended. The original numbering of the remaining allegations is \nretained. \n \n \nDepartment Counsel also requested that I take administrative notice of facts \nrelating to Sierra Leone, set forth in a summary marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, with \nthree attached documents. The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of \ngeneral knowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Adjudicative Guidelines that were implemented by the \nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006. The Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines \nlisted in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness \ndeterminations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n\n \n \n3\nApplicant, 46 years old, is a security officer with a defense contractor. He earned \na certificate in network information technology in 2002, and is currently working toward \na bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. He was born in Sierra Leone, and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1966. (GE 1; Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant married a U.S. citizen in 1994. He met his wife while she was serving in \nthe U.S. Navy. When she was stationed in Europe, he worked for the Navy on base. \nTheir daughter, now 15 years old, attends high school in the United States. Applicant \nand his wife separated in 2001 and divorced in 2003. She is no longer in the Navy, and \nis now a nurse practitioner. Applicant had a relationship with a woman who was born in \nSierra Leone, and who is now a citizen-resident of the United Kingdom (UK). She knows \nthat he is a security officer, but does not know that he is seeking a security clearance. \nThey have a daughter, seven years old, who lives with her mother in the UK. Both \ndaughters are U.S. citizens, and Applicant has daily to weekly contact with them. (GE 1; \nTr. 36-37, 66-73)  \n \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR total approximately $35,000 (excluding two \nduplicate allegations). They are primarily credit card accounts, which Applicant used to \npay household and living expenses. His wife paid the family bills during their marriage, \nbut stopped making payments as they moved toward divorce. After the divorce, \nApplicant responded to the debts that had accumulated by consulting with officials at \nhis credit union. He was referred to a credit counseling service. He enrolled in the \nprogram, and made monthly payments of approximately $200 for six to eight months in \n2003-2004. However, his job contract subsequently ended, his child support payments \nbegan, and he could not afford to continue payments. (Tr. 43-44, 83-84)  \n \n \nThe real estate market at the time had been doing well, and Applicant expected \nto have funds available from the sale of the family home. He planned to use those \nfunds to pay off all of his debts simultaneously. But the real estate market began to \ndecline. Applicant realized that the house value was decreasing and a sale was \nbecoming more unlikely. In November 2007, he waived his rights to his interest in the \nhome. He did not receive compensation from his ex-wife. (AE L; Tr. 40-45)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly salary in February 2010 was $4,000. After taxes and \ndeductions of $580, his net monthly income was $3420. Applicant also pays $175 in \nunion dues and $215 per month in child support, leaving a monthly net income of \n$3,030. After deducting monthly expenses such as rent, loan payments, food, auto and \nhealth care expenses, Applicant has $871 remaining each month. This amount \nfluctuates depending on availability of overtime hours. His savings and investments \ntotal approximately $9,000. He does not use credit cards. For the past three years, \nApplicant\u2019s bills have been paid automatically from his savings account. (GE 2; AE A; \nTr. 38-40, 55, 82)   \n \n \nApplicant approached his debts by saving his money, contacting creditors \ndirectly, and paying each debt in full or through settlement, rather than using monthly \n\n \n \n4\npayment plans. Applicant provided documentation showing that he has paid the debts \nin the SOR, as follows: \n \n \nAllegation 1.a., $8,886 \u2013 SETTLED. (GE 3, 4; AE E, R) \n \n \nAllegation 1.b., $4,785 \u2013 PAID IN FULL (GE 3, 4; AE Q)  \n \n \nAllegation 1.c., $3,489 \u2013 PAID IN FULL (GE 3, 4; AE F) \n \n \nAllegation 1.d., $7,817 \u2013 SETTLED (GE 3, 4; AE O, T) \n \n \nAllegation 1.e., $4,244 \u2013 SETTLED (GE 3, 4; AE P)  \n \n \nAllegation 1.f., $477 \u2013 SETTLED (GE 3, 4; AE G, N) \n \n \nAllegation 1.g., withdrawn (duplicate of allegation 1.e.) \n \nAllegation 1.h., $514 \u2013 When Applicant began work on a new job contract, \nhis automatic child support deductions were not transferred. After he \ncontacted the child support agency, the error was rectified, but it took \nseveral months for the payment to be correctly deducted. The problem \nhas been resolved and the account is up-to-date and in good standing. \n(GE 3, 4; AE H, S; Tr. 53-54)  \n \n \nAllegation 1.i., withdrawn (duplicate of allegation 1.f.) \n \nAllegation 1.j., $4,319 \u2013 Applicant testified that his admission to this debt \nin his Answer was an error. He paid it in approximately 2002, which is \nshown on his credit reports. (GE 3, 4; Tr. 54-55) \n \nApplicant has two brothers (A and B) who live in Sierra Leone. Brother A works \nat a port, and Applicant talks with him about three to four times per year by telephone, \nusually on holidays. Applicant is unaware of the location of Brother B, or his occupation, \nalthough Brother A told him that Brother B might be involved in transporting people by \nbicycle. Brother B sometimes calls Applicant to request money. Since 2006, Applicant \nhas sent about $100 up to two times per year, if either brother requests it. He last saw \nBrother B when he traveled to Sierra Leone for his mother\u2019s funeral in 2007. He has no \nknowledge that either brother has connections to the government of Sierra Leone. They \ndo not know about his job or that he is applying for a security clearance. Applicant does \nnot own property or have other financial interests in the country. (Tr. 56-58, 74-77) \n \nBetween 2007, when his mother died, and 2009, Applicant visited Sierra Leone \nthree times solely to perform memorial rites she had requested. Before she died, he had \nnot been to Sierra Leone in 20 years. (Tr. 58-59, 79-80) \n \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \nApplicant submitted character references from friends who have known him for \n15 to 20 years. They attest to his high degree of integrity and his trustworthiness. One \nfriend extols him as a role model to her and to others. She stated that he organized a \nhumanitarian organization that helps local communities. Applicant's supervisor, a \nlieutenant in the security organization where he works, holds a security clearance. She \nnoted that Applicant has shown a \u201cclear understanding of security concepts\u201d and does \nnot hesitate to report suspicious activity. She finds him to be an honest and trustworthy \nperson who will \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to accomplish tasks. An accountant and friend, who \nhas known Applicant for 40 years, points out that Applicant supported the U.S. Navy \nthrough his employment on base, when his wife was stationed overseas. He knows of \nnothing in 40 years that \u201cwould make me hesitate to recommend him with full \nconfidence\u201d for a position of trust. (AE B, C, D, M) \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts.3 Sierra Leone, a republic with \na multi-party system, is a developing country in western Africa. It has a history of civil \nwar since the early 1990s. The war ended in 2002, with United Nations assistance. The \ncountry held democratic elections in 2007. Generally, the government respects its \ncitizens\u2019 rights. However, violations of rights occur, including poor prison conditions, \narbitrary arrests, restrictions on free speech and press, and discrimination and violence \nagainst women.  \n \nSierra Leone is a member of the Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS) and, with Liberia and Guinea, it formed the Mano River Union (MRU). Its \neconomic policy has shifted from post-conflict stabilization to efforts to reduce poverty, \nfight corruption, and create jobs. It maintains cordial relations with the West, and also \nhas diplomatic relations with China, Cuba, Iran, and Libya. It has especially strong \nrelations with the United Kingdom, which is its largest source of foreign aid. It also \nreceives significant foreign aid from the European Union and the United States. Sierra \nLeone has had a U.S. embassy since 1961. U.S. assistance focuses on \u201cthe \nconsolidation of peace, democracy and human rights, health education, particularly \ncombating HIV-AIDS, and human resources development.\u201d \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \n \n3 The facts cited derive from Hearing Exhibit 1, which includes the following three documents: \nBackground Note: Sierra Leone, U.S. Department of State, June 2009; Country-Specific Information: \nSierra Leone, U.S. Department of State, May 2009; and Sierra Leone: Country Reports on Human \nRights Practices \u2013 2008, U.S. Department of State, February 2009. \n\n \n \n6\n                                                \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the (AG).4 Decisions \nmust also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the \nGuidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of disqualifying or mitigating conditions does not \ndetermine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines are followed when a case can be so measured, as they represent policy \nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.  \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to receive or continue \nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance. Additionally, the government must be able to prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it falls to \napplicants to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has \na \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion.6 A \nperson who has access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship based on \ntrust and confidence. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that \napplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to protect the \nnational interest as her or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d \nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information in favor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n \n7\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence requires consideration of two relevant disqualifying conditions: AG \n\u00b619 (a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Applicant\u2019s accumulation over the past several years of \napproximately $35,000 in delinquencies supports application of both conditions. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances; and \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control. \n \nApplicant receives credit under mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b), which focuses \non an applicant's response to factors beyond his control. Here, Applicant planned to \nresolve his debts with the funds from sale of his home after his divorce. However, the \nreal estate market crashed, and the house lost value. The unexpected market decline \nwas beyond his control. Applicant had developed a reasonable plan based on the \nsteady increase in the value of the house at the time. AG \u00b6 20(c) also applies because \nApplicant sought financial assistance from his credit union after his divorce. He \nfollowed the advice he received by contracting with a counseling service to resolve his \ndebts. He made payments to that service until he was unable to afford the payments. \nHe took these actions in 2003 and 2004, long before the security clearance process \nbegan. His most recent efforts involved saving money until he had enough to pay each \ndebt. He then contacted creditors, and paid or settled each debt in the SOR. His \nfinances are under control.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the \nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or \nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \n\n \n \n8\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target \nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b67(a): \n \ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \nApplicant has foreign family ties through his two brothers who live in Sierra \nLeone. He last saw his brothers in 2007 when he visited for his mother\u2019s funeral. Since \nthen, he visited Sierra Leone two times to conduct memorial rites for his mother. He \nsometimes sends his brothers several hundred dollars on holidays. He is in touch with \none brother a few times per year. Such ties raise questions as to whether a heightened \nrisk of foreign influence exists. AG \u00b6 7(a) applies. \n \nThe foreign influence guideline also includes factors that can mitigate security \nconcerns. Under AG \u00b6 8, the following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation. \n \nThe United States and Sierra Leone have cordial relations. The United States \nhas maintained an embassy in Sierra Leone for more than 50 years, and provides \n\n \n \n9\nfinancial aid. The documents submitted do not indicate that Sierra Leone targets U.S. \nclassified information.  \n \nAlthough Applicant has brothers in Sierra Leone, such contacts do not \nautomatically disqualify an Applicant from obtaining a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \ncontact with his two brothers does not represent a risk of foreign influence. He is in \ntouch with one brother a few times per year. He has less contact with his other brother, \nand does not even know where he is. Although Applicant visited Sierra Leone three \ntimes between 2007 and 2009, it was with the specific purpose of performing the \nmemorial rites he had promised to his mother. Before 2007, he had not been to Sierra \nLeone in 20 years. Even though he sometimes sends money to his brother, it is \nunlikely that Applicant would be exploited based on these relationships.  \n \nApplicant's ties to the United States weigh in his favor when evaluating the \nquestion of potential conflicts of interest. His connections and relationships in the \nUnited States are far more important than his connections to Sierra Leone. He was \neducated in the United States. He was married to a U.S. service member. He \nsupported the U.S. Navy when he worked on base while his wife served on active duty \noverseas. His teenaged daughter is a native-born U.S. citizen and he maintains a \nconstant presence in her life here in the United States. He has long-standing \nrelationships with friends and co-workers, as demonstrated by his character \nreferences. I conclude that he would choose these strong U.S. ties over his limited \nforeign connections, in the event that a conflict of interest arose. Mitigating conditions \nAG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the cited \n\n \n \n10\nguidelines, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nForeign family ties raise security concerns because of the potential for conflicts \nof interest and exploitation. Here, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his brothers in Sierra Leone \nraise such concerns. He has traveled to Sierra Leone three times since 2007; however, \nhis trips were solely for the limited purpose of performing memorial rites after his \nmother passed away, and they are concluded. Before these trips, he had not been to \nSierra Leone in 20 years. He has infrequent contacts with his brothers, and sometimes \nprovides them with financial gifts. However, Applicant\u2019s strong ties to the United States \nthrough his education, his daughter, his job, and his friends represent substantial ties \nto the United States. I conclude that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe United States.  \n \n \nApplicant accrued financial delinquencies during his marriage. He attended \ncounseling, but after several months of payments, he could not afford to continue these \nefforts. He planned to pay the debts when he sold his house after his divorce. \nHowever, the real estate market crashed, the house lost its value, and in 2007, he \nwaived his rights to his interest because he believed it would be too difficult to sell. \nSince then, he developed his own plan to resolve the debts. He has saved money, \ncontacted creditors, and provided documentation that he paid each of the SOR debts. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised concerning Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.j.  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified her May 2008 e-QIP by failing to disclose an outstanding judgment debt in response to question 27 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) or any debts delinquent over 180 days in the past seven years in response to question 28 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). In her Answer, Applicant admitted that she had outstanding debts in her name, but asserted she was a victim of identity theft. She indicated she first learned of the debts in February/March 2008 but was delayed in her efforts to have them removed from her credit record because of her mother\u2019s terminal illness and her own cancer diagnosis. At her hearing, she acknowledged owing a $1,372 judgment from June 2005 that she thought had been covered by insurance (Tr. 11-12). She also explained that she had not listed the debts on her e-QIP because she did not incur them. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has several delinquent debts on her credit record that she disputes.\nShe owes a $1,372 small claims judgment from June 2005 that she believes may be for\nfailure to pay restitution from a 2001 vandalism incident when she was 18. She is\ncurrently pursuing legal action to determine who stole her identity, and the delay in\naddressing her restitution debt is credibly explained by medical issues that have\ndiverted her attention and negatively affected her finances. Applicant did not list any\ndelinquent debts or the judgment on her security clearance application because she had\nonly recently learned of them and believed they were not her debts. Clearance is\ngranted.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 28, 2008. On February 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny her a security clearance and refer the matter to an\nAugust 18, 2009\n\n2\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn February 24, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 2, 2009, to conduct a hearing and to determine\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. On May 4, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for May 28, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Six government exhibits (Ex. 1-6) and\nseven Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-G) were admitted without any objections. Applicant also\ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 8, 2009.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open for two weeks for her to submit\nadditional documentation to substantiate her claim of identity theft. Applicant submitted\ntwo documents, a statement and copy of a complaint and affidavit, which were marked\nand entered as Exhibits H and I. Department Counsel filed no objections by the June\n22, 2009, due date.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\nten delinquent debts totaling $12,881 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.j). Under Guideline E, personal\nconduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified her May 2008 e-QIP by\nfailing to disclose an outstanding judgment debt in response to question 27 (SOR \u00b6 2.a)\nor any debts delinquent over 180 days in the past seven years in response to question\n28 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). In her Answer, Applicant admitted that she had outstanding debts in her\nname, but asserted she was a victim of identity theft. She indicated she first learned of\nthe debts in February/March 2008 but was delayed in her efforts to have them removed\nfrom her credit record because of her mother\u2019s terminal illness and her own cancer\ndiagnosis. At her hearing, she acknowledged owing a $1,372 judgment from June 2005\nthat she thought had been covered by insurance (Tr. 11-12). She also explained that\nshe had not listed the debts on her e-QIP because she did not incur them. After\nconsidering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 26-year-old high school graduate, who has been employed as an\noffice clerk on a military installation since May 2008 (Ex. 1), initially on a temporary\nbasis. Her supervisor fought for her to become a permanent employee, and in spring\n2009 Applicant was given a permanent position with a defense contractor (Ex. C). She\nwas granted an interim secret clearance in late May 2008 (Ex. G).\nApplicant held a series of jobs after high school (child care worker, convenience\nstore cashier, waitress, receptionist) (Ex. 1). In June 2005, a creditor obtained a $1,372\n\nThe address listed for Applicant on the small claims court judgment (Ex. 5) is apparently her sister\u2019s\n1\naddress (Tr. 64). Applicant denied that she ever lived at that address, that she ever used that address to\nreceive mail or bills, or that she provided that address to the police or court (Tr. 64-65).\n3\nsmall claims judgment against her (SOR \u00b6 1.b)  (Ex. 5). Applicant had not paid court-\n1\nordered restitution for a damaged windshield from an incident that occurred in the\nsummer following her high school graduation in 2001. After drinking to intoxication,\nApplicant accompanied two friends who wanted to retaliate against one of their former\nboyfriends. A friend drove Applicant\u2019s car as she sat in the rear seat. Someone\n(Applicant denies culpability) threw a rock from their vehicle and cracked the ex-\nboyfriend\u2019s car windshield. Applicant was implicated by her friends in the vandalism\nwhen they were questioned by the police. Despite her repeated denials of culpability,\nshe agreed to plead no contest to one count of obstruction of justice. She was placed\non one year probation, fined $93, and ordered to pay restitution for the damaged\nwindshield (Ex. 6, Tr. 42-46). When Applicant asked about paying restitution, she was\ntold by her probation officer that repair costs were covered by an insurance company\nand that the victim would have to proceed against her in small claims court (Tr. 101).\nShe made no effort to confirm the accuracy of the advice (Tr. 101-02).\nIn May 2007, she began working as a membership service representative at a\nlocal branch of the YMCA. Responsible for greeting members and visitors and for walk-\nin sales, she has continued to maintain that job part-time (one to two shifts a week)\nwhile working for the defense contractor (Tr. 30). She is considered to be an asset to\nthe YMCA (Ex. B) as well as to her supervisors at the military base. Applicant\u2019s primary\nemployment is at a government information technology center\u2019s call center/help desk,\nwhere she has been courteous, responsible, and conscientious (Exs. C, D).\nApplicant and her significant other, who have cohabited at their present\nresidence since June 2007 (Tr. 33), sought a mortgage to purchase a home together in\nFebruary 2008 (Ex. I, Tr. 35). At that time, the mortgage lender checked both of their\ncredit records. Several accounts were reported as delinquent on Applicant\u2019s credit\nrecord, including a cellular telephone debt of $235 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and credit card\naccounts, that she did not recognize (Exs. 4, 6). Applicant had not opened a credit card\naccount since she was 18 and had \u201cmaxed-out\u201d the $400 balances on two credit cards.\nShe closed the accounts after paying them off (Ex. 6, Tr. 37). Believing she had been\nthe victim of identity theft, Applicant placed a 90-day fraud alert on her credit record.\nShe was told that she could do nothing to erase the fraudulent entries from her credit\nrecord other than wait seven years when they would then be removed (Ex. 6). Applicant\nwas also preoccupied with caring for her mother, who suffered from stage III cervical\ncancer, and had learned during a January 2008 hospitalization that her disease had\nmetastasized. Applicant\u2019s mother required daily radiation and three times weekly\nchemotherapy, and Applicant drove her mother to those treatments in February 2008\n(Tr. 49-52).\nIn about March 2008, Applicant and her significant other vacationed in Florida\nwhen they were approached by a sales person about vacation ownership at a golf resort\nin Florida. After touring the facility, and at the urging of her boyfriend, Applicant and her\n\nApplicant certified the accuracy of the information electronically on May 21, 2008, but she did not sign\n2\nthe form until May 28, 2008 (Ex. 1). \nConceivably, Applicant\u2019s sister or her sister\u2019s ex-husband could have fraudulently obtained credit in\n3\nher name, given the address information on the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s representation during her\nsubject interview that her sister owed between $2,000 and $3,000 to the retailer who had referred a collection\naccount in her name to the assignee in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant was not asked how she knew her sister owed\nthe retailer. It is less likely that Applicant is lying about never having opened the accounts or having lived with\nher sister given her background was being investigated by the government. She would not have known the\nscope of the investigation.\n4\nboyfriend jointly bought a timeshare interest at the resort that costs them $296 per\nmonth plus $600 a year in taxes (Tr. 66, 105). The timeshare will be paid off in 2015 (Tr.\n66).\nIn May 2008, Applicant began working on a military installation as a temporary\ncontract worker in an information technology department. She completed an e-QIP on\nMay 28, 2008,  and did not disclose the 2001 obstruction of justice charge in answer to\n2\nquestion 23.f, concerning any arrests or charges within the last seven years. She did\nnot list the judgment debt in response to question 27.d, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you\nhad any judgments against you that have not been paid.\u201d She also responded \u201cNo\u201d to\nquestions 28.a, concerning any debts delinquent over 180 days in the last seven years,\nand 28.b, concerning any debts currently delinquent over 90 days (Ex. 1). Applicant had\nbeen advised that she would have the opportunity to explain her answers during a\nsubject interview (Tr. 48).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on June 12, 2008, revealed several past due\naccounts in her name in addition to the judgment debt: a telephone services debt of\n$235 on an account opened in October 2000 with last activity in May 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a);\na charged off credit card debt of $1,692 in collection since May 2007 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6  1.c and\n1.h duplicate); a retail revolving charge debt of $3,680 in collection with no activity since\nFebruary 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $1,464 credit card debt in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.i\nduplicate), a $1,331 VISA credit card debt charged off in May 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and a\n$208 cellular phone debt in collection since September 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.j) (Ex. 4). She\nwas current in her car payments on a $13,481 loan taken out in September 2006 (Ex. 4)\nfor the purchase of a pre-owned 2000 model-year vehicle (Tr. 37). Her loan has an\ninterest rate of 17% (Tr. 38) with her monthly payment at $309.74 for 72 months (Tr.\n39). There was a security alert noted in her credit record because of a substantial\naddress variance. Applicant was listed as having lived at her home address as well as\nan address that belongs to her sister. Applicant\u2019s first and last names were associated\nwith that address, but the middle initial was different.3\nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator on June 25, 2008, about\nthe vandalism incident, the debts listed on her credit report, and her failure to disclose\nher arrest or the debts on her e-QIP. Applicant denied incurring the debts and surmised\nshe had been the victim of identity fraud via the Internet in about 2000. She indicated\nshe first learned of the debts in April 2008 [sic], when she and her boyfriend applied for\na mortgage loan. She denied having any credit cards other than two accounts that she\n\n5\nopened in 2000 in her name and quickly charged their credit limit of $400. On her\nmother\u2019s advice, she closed the accounts after paying off the delinquent balances. She\ndenied she ever held a cellular phone account in her name. Other than putting a fraud\nalert on her account for 90 days, she had done nothing about the debts and did not\nintend to repay them. Applicant recalled receiving a collection letter within the last\nmonth or two that could have been related to the judgment debt but she did not respond\nbecause she assumed it was a result of Internet fraud and she understood there was\nnothing she could do other than pay the debt. She did not recognize the name of the\ncollection agency holding the judgment (Tr. 63). She also received calls from the\noriginal lender of SOR \u00b6 1.d, but she assumed the creditor had mistaken her for her\nsister, who owed between $2,000 and $3,000 to the original lender. Applicant explained\nshe had not listed any of the delinquent accounts on her e-QIP because she had not\nincurred the debts. Applicant indicated she was current in her car loan and was not\nknowingly delinquent on any of her accounts. She had not listed her 2001 arrest on her\ne-QIP because she had been told it would be expunged from her record after three\nyears since it was her first offense and she pled no contest (Ex. 6).\nApplicant\u2019s mother died in June 2008 (Tr. 52). In August 2008, Applicant\nunderwent cancer surgery herself, and she was out of work for five weeks (Tr. 52). She\nreturned to work on a part-time basis in mid-September 2008 (Tr. 52). In the fall of\n2008, she contacted the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f about deleting the debts but\nwas told that she would have to file a complaint with the police, who were not receptive\nto her claim of identity theft (Tr. 53-57). She was unsuccessful in her attempts to speak\nwith a representative of the collection agency in SOR \u00b6 1.d (Tr. 53) or the bank in SOR\n\u00b6 1.g (Tr. 54-55).\nAt DOHA\u2019s request, Applicant responded to financial interrogatories and\ncompleted a personal financial statement on December 12, 2008. She reiterated she\nhad been the victim of identity theft and was not making payments on those accounts\nthat were not opened by her, but she had begun repaying recent medical debt.\nApplicant estimated that she and her significant other were operating at a net deficit of\n$61 each month after paying monthly expenses, including $296 per month for the\ntimeshare at a golf club (Ex. 2) but not including her car payment of $309 (Tr. 69).\nApplicant now challenges the accuracy of those figures in that she managed to pay her\nbills by not spending when she did not have the money, and by relying on her boyfriend\nand her father for help when needed (Tr. 79).\nIn December 2008, she began repaying medical bills totaling between $17,000\nand $22,000 from her surgery at between $300 and $400 a month. She did not have\nmedical insurance at the time of her surgery and is under a payment plan with the\nhospital to repay her $16,000 debt to them (Ex. 2, Tr. 68-69, 98-99).\nAs of December 23, 2008, Equifax was still reporting that Applicant owed the\ndelinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (updated balance $389), 1.b, 1.c (updated balance\n$1,492 of $918 debt listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.i), 1.d ($3,821 updated balance), 1.e,\nand 1.g (Ex. 3). On May 27, 2009, Applicant put a fraud alert on her credit record (Ex.\nE), and she filed a complaint with the local police of identity fraud  from November 2001,\n\nApplicant listed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h. From my review of the available credit\n4\nrecords, SOR \u00b6 1.h does not represent an additional debt and instead was the original amount referred for\ncollection to the assignee in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant did not include the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.i\nduplicate listings) or SOR \u00b6 1.j, which does not appear on her latest credit report.\nApplicant explained that the police were more receptive this time because a detective she knows from\n5\nthe YMCA told her to come in and file the report while he was working (Tr. 58).\nW hen asked which collection agency claimed it could withdraw what she owed from her bank\n6\naccount, Applicant responded she believed it was the assignee listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d, although she could not\nbe certain. She had previously testified that she had no success in reaching that creditor (\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was\nthe number that was actually correct for them because once I called one number, I got about nine more and\nI\u2019m pretty much still in the same spot.\u201d Tr. 53).  Applicant may well have had no success when she tried to\ncontact the creditor even if the creditor managed to reach her once. \n6\nalleging that about $16,000 of credit card debts had been incurred illegally in her name\nwithin one month\u2019s time, and that she learned of the fraudulent activity in February\n2008.  She listed a former friend as the possible perpetrator because this friend\n4\ndisappeared around the time the accounts were opened and she knew her social\nsecurity number from when they used to work together as cocktail waitresses (Ex. I, Tr.\n59-60). Applicant was given a copy of the report so that she could cancel the fraudulent\ncredit card accounts (Ex. A). As of June 2009, Applicant had met with a local police\ndetective in an effort to determine who had stolen her identity (Ex. H).5\nApplicant received a tax refund of $1,200 for tax year 2008 that she used to pay\noff some medical bills, veterinary costs, and groceries (Tr. 108). As of late May 2009,\nApplicant was relying on some financial assistance from her father (Tr. 79). Applicant\u2019s\nrent was scheduled to increase from $1,165 to $1,270 at the end of May 2009 (Tr. 67).\nShe does not have her own bank account. She testified that she was told by a collection\nagency in about early April 2009 that her bank account could be attached to recover\ndelinquent debt (Tr. 71-72).  Applicant has not yet contacted the court or the collection\n6\nagency in SOR \u00b6 1.b regarding the judgment debt (Tr. 74), although she intends to\nrepay it if it is shown to be valid (Tr. 102). Applicant is willing to press charges against\nwhomever stole her identity (Tr. 79). As of June 11, 2009, Applicant\u2019s hourly wage was\n$18. She needs her job to pay her medical bills (Ex. H).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\n\n7\ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n\nIt is possible that the $1,376 small claims court judgment is for a debt other than the restitution,\n7\nalthough the original creditor is the county district court.\n8\nApplicant is no longer disputing a small claims court judgment of $1,372 from\nJune 2005 that she believes is for restitution stemming from a 2001 vandalism incident.7\nAnother $8,933 in delinquent debt appears on her credit record that she has\nconsistently maintained was due to theft of her identity. Applicant provided no evidence\nto confirm that those accounts were fraudulently opened in her name. However, she\nfiled a complaint with the local police on May 27, 2009, in an effort to determine the\nsource of the debts. Applicant recently placed a fraud alert on her credit record. At this\njuncture, it would be premature to conclude that she will not have to repay the debts, but\nher actions are in accord with her stated belief that the debts were not incurred by her.\nShe is unlikely to have filed a knowingly false report implicating a former friend for she\nwould be opening herself up to possibly subjecting herself to criminal prosecution.\nAG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d applies to the small\nclaims court judgment that has not been paid. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts,\u201d is also implicated because it is unclear whether Applicant has the\nfinancial means to satisfy the restitution (or other debts, if any, that are shown to be\nhers after they are investigated). Applicant reported a net monthly deficit of $61 as of\nDecember 2008, not including her car payment. She contends that she has nonetheless\nmanaged to meet her obligations by reducing her spending when necessary, and her\nfather has given her some financial help. But she also used some of her income tax\nrefund to pay bills, and she owes between $17,000 and $22,000 in medical debt.\nSince the small claims judgment has not been paid, and the source of the other\ndebts has yet to be determined, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\ncannot reasonably apply in mitigation. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d mitigates at least in part\nthe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s delay in confronting the identity theft and\nrestitution issues. Applicant knew she was required to pay restitution as part of her\nsentence for the 2001 obstruction of justice/vandalism incident. At the end of her\nprobation, she asked when she should pay the restitution, and was told that it had been\ncovered by insurance. While she should have questioned that advice, there is no\nindication that she learned of the small claims judgment or of the delinquent accounts in\nher name until February 2008 when she and her boyfriend applied for a mortgage.\nApplicant filed for a 90-day fraud alert but did nothing else at that time as she was\nhelping care for her mother. The evidence also shows that she and her boyfriend\nmanaged a trip to Florida during her mother\u2019s illness, and that she showed poor\nfinancial judgment in buying into the timeshare. However, her mother\u2019s death and then\nher own diagnosis with cancer and subsequent treatment, resulting in $17,000 to\n$22,000 of new medical debt, are circumstances under AG 20(b) that explain her\ninaction. Applicant had other priorities than investigating old debt that she had good\n\nDOHA did not allege Applicant\u2019s omission of her 2001 arrest from her e-QIP. Presumably, DOHA\n8\naccepted her explanation that she believed it need not be reported since she had been told it would be\nexpunged.\n9\nreason to doubt that she incurred.  The evidence also shows that Applicant continued to\nhold a mistaken belief until recently that she could do nothing other than wait for the\nseven years for the debt to drop off her credit report.\nIdentity theft, although certainly a circumstance outside of one\u2019s control, is more\nappropriately covered under AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue.\u201d The filing of a police complaint falls short of the\ndocumented proof required to substantiate that the debts were obtained by false\npretenses, although it is a necessary initial action to resolve the issue. Applicant has yet\nto contact the court or the collection agency regarding the judgment debt. It would be\npremature at this point to fully apply AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e), 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d or 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d However, under a whole-person\nconcept, Applicant has shown that her finances are under control. She is making timely\npayments on her car loan, the vacation ownership interest, her rent, and the hospital\ndebt incurred as a result of her cancer surgery.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant does not dispute that she responded \u201cNo\u201d to the judgment and debt\ndelinquency inquiries on her e-QIP.  At her hearing, she admitted that she \u201ctechnically\u201d\n8\nshould have responded \u201cYes\u201d because she had recently learned there was debt in her\nname. Substantial personal conduct concerns are raised by the \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d (AG \u00b6 16(a)). Yet\nApplicant\u2019s motive was not to conceal information from the government. She did not\ndisclose the debts or judgment because she believed they were incurred fraudulently by\nsomeone who had stolen her identity. She understood she would be given an\nopportunity to explain the situation in an interview (Tr. 48), and during that interview she\n\n10\nasserted that the debts were fraudulently incurred. She volunteered that she had\ncontact with her sister\u2019s ex-husband who was a convicted felon through interactions\ninvolving her niece and nephew. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply in the absence of willful\nintent. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant has shown some financial naivete in taking out an automobile loan at\n17% interest. She showed her immaturity in drinking to intoxication, which led to the\nvandalism and restitution debt. The rock was thrown from her car when she was\npresent, even if one of her companions was culpable of the vandalism. She showed\npoor financial judgment and susceptibility to pressure when she bought into the vacation\nownership in March 2008.  Although she and her boyfriend have apparently been able\nto make their monthly payments, she had learned just one month earlier that some\ncredit card debts were listed on her credit record. She believed they were not hers, but\nshe also did not know whether she would be held responsible for them. Her purchase of\nthe vacation interest is difficult to justify under those circumstances.\nFamily and personal medical issues understandably diverted her attention from\ninvestigating those disputed debts in 2008, although she should have acted more\naggressively in 2009 to get to the root of the debts. Instead, she waited until the day\nbefore her hearing to file a report with the police. But her filing of a formal complaint of\nidentity theft (debt by false pretenses) is an indication of her seriousness in resolving\nthe issue. She has no open active credit card accounts in her name, and is making\nmonthly payments on her car loan, the timeshare, and her medical debt. She continues\nto work part-time (one or two shifts per week) at the YMCA in addition to maintaining\nher defense contractor employment. Her work references are uniformly positive\nconcerning her professionalism, conscientiousness, and reliability on the job, even while\nshe was experiencing stressful issues at home. She has explained her failure to\ndisclose her debts and even her arrest on her SF 86 and she now understands that she\nshould have listed them whether or not they were her debts or whether she believed the\narrest had been expunged from her record.\n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Gov 1) A subsequent background investigation confirmed that Applicant had \nthe following delinquent accounts:  a $324 medical account that was placed for \ncollection in December 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 4 at 1); a $119 medical account that was \nplaced for collection in April 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 3 at 12); a $76 medical account that \nwas placed for collection in July 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 3 at 7); an $851 medical account \nthat was placed for collection in July 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 3 at 6); and a $75 medical \naccount that was placed for collection in July 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 3 at 6).  \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $148 medical account that was placed \nfor collection in July 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 3 at 6); a $627 medical account placed for \ncollection in June 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 4 at 1); a $689 medical account that was \nplaced for collection in July 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 3 at 6); a $770 medical account that \nwas placed for collection in July 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 3 at 5); and a $2,070 medical \naccount that was placed for collection in July 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 3 at 5). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $358 medical account that was placed \nfor collection in June 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 4 at 2); a $244 credit card account placed \nfor collection in June 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 4 at 2); a $241 account related to damages \nto a leased property that was placed for collection in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 4 at \n2); a $235 medical account that was placed for collection in June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov \n3 at 8); a $340 medical account placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.o: Gov 3 \nat 8); and a $203 medical account that was placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.p: Gov 3 at 7). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $526 medical account that was placed \nfor collection in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.q: Gov 3 at 8); a $206 medical account placed \nfor collection in August 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.r: Gov 3 at 7); a $766 credit card account that \nwas placed for collection in February 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.s: Gov 3 at 5, 21; Gov 4 at 2); a \n$554 account that was placed for collection in August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.t: Gov 3 at 9; Gov \n\n \n3 \n \n \n4 at 2); an $820 account placed for collection in March 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.u: Gov 4 at 2); \nand a $823 credit card account that was placed for collection in July 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.v: \nGov 3 at 21; Gov 4 at 2-3). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $449 account that was placed for \ncollection in March 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.w: Gov 4 at 3); a $647 credit card account placed for \ncollection in October 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.x: Gov 4 at 3); a $304 traffic ticket account that \nwas placed for collection in March 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.y: Gov 3 at 4); a $185 medical \naccount that was placed for collection in June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.z: Gov 3 at 8); a $7,000 \ndebt owed as a result of an automobile repossession (SOR \u00b6 1.aa: Gov 3 at 9); and a \n$2,554 credit card account that was charged off in May 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.bb: Gov 3 at  \n10). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $303 medical account that was placed \nfor collection in August 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.cc: Gov 3 at 11); a $982 credit card account \nplaced for collection in February 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.dd: Gov 3 at 12, 21); a $56 medical \naccount that was placed for collection in May 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.ee: Gov 3 at 13); a $353 \nbank account that was placed for collection in June 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.ff: Gov 3 at 13); an \n$821 bank account placed for collection in June 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.gg: Gov 3 at 13); a \n$1,754 medical account that was placed for collection in November 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.hh:                 \nGov 3 at 20); and a $540 cash advance account that was placed for collection in July \n2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.ii: Gov 3 at 21). \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that she was not financially able to pay the \ndebts. Her financial problems were caused by being irresponsible with credit cards. She \nis trying to get her credit back in good standing. She is considering filing for bankruptcy.  \nShe contacted a credit counseling agency and asked about bankruptcy, but has not \ntaken steps towards filing for bankruptcy. (Tr at 19-22) \n \nThe SOR alleges 35 delinquent debts. Of those debts, 20 are medical debts. \nApplicant incurred these expenses for routine medical care for her family when she had \nno health insurance. She did not work for a year after the birth of her second child in \n1996. She was laid off for about one month in 2003. She was laid off for two weeks on \nanother occasion. She could not recall the year. (Tr at 26-27, 43)  \n \nApplicant denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.y which was a $304 traffic ticket. \nHer credit report dated July 30, 2008, indicates this was a paid collection. (Gov 3 at 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.y is found for Applicant. Applicant also denied the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, \n1.v, 1.bb, 1.ff, 1.gg, and 1.ii because she did not recognize the accounts. She provided \nno evidence that she took steps to formally dispute the accounts.  \n \nShe describes her financial situation as living paycheck to paycheck. Her monthly \nincome is approximately $2,631. She estimates that she has approximately $100 left \nover after expenses. (Tr at 27-32; Gov 2 at 4) On June 12, 2009, she paid off a $619.64 \ndebt owed to a payday loan company. (AE A) This debt was not alleged in the SOR. \nShe has approximately $12,000 in student loans. Her student loans are in forbearance \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbecause of her financial hardship. (Tr at 24) Applicant provided no evidence about her \nwork performance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  Applicant has 35 delinquent accounts,  \nan approximate total balance of $27,013. Applicant claims that she is financially unable \nto repay these debts.   \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following Financial Considerations \nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. With the exception \nof SOR \u00b6 1.y, the majority of Applicant\u2019s debts remain delinquent. As of the date of the \nhearing, Applicant had no plan in place to resolve her delinquent accounts. Her financial \nsituation remains unstable.  FC MC \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Of the 35 delinquent \n\n \n6 \n \n \naccounts, 20 accounts are medical accounts that were incurred by Applicant and her \nfour children during a period of time that she had no medical insurance.  Past periods of \nunemployment also contributed to some of the debt. However, I cannot conclude \nApplicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances because she has not resolved \nher delinquent accounts. Several of the accounts alleged in the SOR were placed for \ncollection in 2007 and 2008 when she was employed full-time. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.z, 1.bb, 1.dd, \n1.ee, 1.ff, 1.gg, 1.hh, and 1.ii). FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight due to Applicant\u2019s \nlack of effort towards resolving her delinquent accounts.   \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant contacted a credit counseling agency, but did not \nfollow through with a debt repayment plan. Her financial situation remains unstable.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Aside from the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.y, Applicant has not taken steps towards resolving her delinquent accounts, \nprimarily, because she is financially unable to repay the debts. She is considering filing \nfor bankruptcy, but had not taken steps towards doing so at the time of the hearing.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(e) ( the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) potentially applies with respect to the debts that Applicant denies. However, \naside from the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.y, no documented proof was submitted \nindicating a valid basis for disputing each debt. In addition, Applicant did not formally \ndispute the debts that she denies with the credit reporting agency.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided no evidence \npertaining to her work performance and other whole person factors. Applicant has a \nsignificant amount of unresolved delinquent accounts. I considered that more than half \nof the accounts are medical bills. I considered that Applicant resolved a payday loan \naccount not alleged in the SOR. However, 34 of the debts alleged in the SOR remain \ndelinquent, and it is unlikely Applicant will be able to resolve these accounts based on \nher income in the near future. For these reasons, Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.z:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.aa:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.bb:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.cc:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.dd:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ee:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ff:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.gg:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.hh:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ii:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 8, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On March 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \n \n1  FORM Item 4. \n \nSeptember 10, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be denied or revoked. \n \nOn March 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated April 6, 2009, was provided to him by \nletter dated April 7, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on April 15, 2009. He was \nafforded a period of 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. He failed to submit any materials, comments, or objections in \nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on August 6, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, and 1.g. He \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, and 1.h through 1.m. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old engineering flight test technician working for a defense \ncontractor.3 He served in the U.S. Army on active duty from March 1975 to March 1978. \nHe attended college from January 1987 to July 1994, and received a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin professional aeronautics. Applicant indicated he was issued a secret security \nclearance, but provided no information about the period when he was granted access or \nthe agency that sponsored his clearance. There is no evidence that he ever \ncompromised or caused others to compromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant has been married and divorced three times. He indicated he has at \nleast one adult son (Item 8). Applicant\u2019s security clearance application shows he has \nconsistently worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, from September \n1985 to the present.  \n \nIn his 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed he had tax liens \nagainst him for failure to pay his federal taxes. He also disclosed having debts over 180 \ndays delinquent during the last seven years. He explained his financial problems were \ndue to his poor financial decisions and expenses incurred caring for his son. He claimed \nthat during the last two years he borrowed money from his father and friends to resolve \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  Item 4 (2008 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this decision, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nsome of his debts (Item 4). Applicant\u2019s credit reports show he has been paying some of \nhis delinquent and/or charged-off debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed that in 1992, he filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy protection and was released of all his dischargeable debts (Item 8). \nApplicant explained his financial problems then were due to his poor decision-making \ncaused by his problems with drugs and alcohol. In June 1997, Applicant owed $32,000 \nto the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) because of unpaid federal income taxes for tax \nyears 1986, 1987, and 1992 through 1996 (Item 9). In 1997, Applicant made a $5,000 \nsettlement offer to the IRS that was rejected. He presented no evidence of additional \nefforts to pay, settle, or resolve his IRS debts until 2009.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent and/or charged-off accounts, totaling \napproximately $24,600, which were established by two credit reports (Items 6 and 7).4 \nMost of the debts have been delinquent for many years. Six of the SOR allegations \nconcern tax liens filed against Applicant in 1993, 1994, 1997, 2001 (two), and in 2008. \nApplicant contacted the IRS in January 2009, apparently seeking a settlement for back \ntaxes due for tax year 1998. He is still waiting for the IRS response.  \n \nApplicant provided no explanations about the other seven SOR delinquent debts \nhe denied, which are also established by the record evidence. Applicant failed to explain \nhow he acquired these debts, why they became delinquent, what he has done to \nresolve the debts. I also note that in 2008, DOHA issued Applicant a financial \ninterrogatory in which he was asked to explain the status of the same seven debts \nalleged in the SOR. He failed to address any of these debts. \n \nApplicant provided no evidence concerning his monthly income, expenses, and \noverall current financial situation. He also failed to indicate whether he has participated \nin financial counseling, and how he intends to avoid similar financial problems in the \nfuture.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n \n4  An applicant\u2019s credit report showing the delinquent debts alleged in an SOR is sufficient to \nestablish the government\u2019s prima facie case. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2003). \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n5  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6  \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant has accumulated 13 delinquent and/or charged-off accounts totaling \napproximately $24,600, most of which have been outstanding for many years. Six of the \nSOR allegations concern tax liens filed against Applicant in 1993, 1994, 1997, 2001 \n(two), and 2008. Applicant\u2019s evidence of efforts to resolve his financial obligations is \nlimited to two incidents of correspondence with the IRS to propose a settlement. \nOtherwise, he presented no evidence of efforts to pay or resolve any of the financial \nobligations alleged in the SOR.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to fully raise the applicability of any \nmitigating condition. His financial problems are ongoing and his evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast \ndoubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant presented little evidence to establish circumstances beyond his control \ncontributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., periods of unemployment, business \ndownturn, or expenses caused by one of his divorces. Other than his two contacts with \nthe IRS, Applicant presented no evidence of efforts to contact creditors, or to resolve his \ndebts by entering into settlement agreements or payment plans with any creditors. \nApplicant has been consistently employed since 1985. His favorable information fails to \nestablish a track record of financial responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because there are no clear indications that his \nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control. He also failed to present any \nevidence that he received financial counseling or that his financial problems are not \nlikely to recur. The remaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the \nfacts in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant receives credit for his \nthree years of service to his country and his 24 years working for a government \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontractor. There is no evidence of any security violation, or that he ever compromised \nclassified information. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation. \n \nNotwithstanding, security concerns remain about Applicant\u2019s current financial \nresponsibility, reliability, and judgment. The sparse record evidence fails to convince me \nof Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 5, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested that the case be decided on the written record.  On May 12, 2010, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge erred in his application\nof the pertinent mitigating conditions.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the\nJudge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a software engineer for\na Defense contractor.  He holds a B.S. degree, having graduated from college with honors.  Divorced,\nhe remarried in 2008.  \nApplicant began consuming alcoholic beverages as a teenager.  He has consumed alcohol to\nthe point of memory loss and blackouts.  In addition, his alcohol use has contributed to criminal\nconduct.  At age 17, while drinking with friends, Applicant stole carpet from a home construction\nsite.  He was convicted of larceny, serving nine months in jail and paying restitution.  \nIn 1981 he operated a motorcycle while intoxicated and had a serious accident.  He was\nconvicted of DUI and was required to attend meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).  From 1984\nuntil 1991 Applicant abstained from the use of alcohol due to the effect it was having on his life.\nHe underwent treatment for bipolar disorder and alcohol consumption from 1995 until 2004.  He\nreceived treatment for alcohol dependence from 2005 to 2006.\nIn 2006 Applicant drank until he was impaired and ran his vehicle off the road.  He began\nwalking and was arrested for public intoxication.  He was given pretrial diversion and participated\nin an alcohol rehabilitation program.  \nIn June 2007, he was convicted of DWI.  He received a suspended jail sentence, was ordered\nto pay a fine and court fees, placed on probation, or directed to attend an alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram.  Additionally, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year.\nThe following September, Applicant drank to excess, blacked out, and was arrested for public\nnudity and public intoxication.  Convicted of the latter charge, he was given a suspended jail\nsentence, ordered to pay a fine and court fees, and placed on probation.  He attended an alcohol\nrehabilitation program from late 2007 until mid 2008.  He cooperated fully with the counselors.  His\ndiagnosis included alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder.\nIn 2008 Applicant experienced a relapse into alcohol consumption.  He disclosed this fact\nto his counselors.  He successfully completed the treatment program, with a good prognosis.  He has\nbeen sober since 2008 and participates in AA.  \n\n3\nApplicant experienced difficulties in his early life, due to abuse he suffered in foster homes\nand by adopted parents after he was abandoned by his mother.  His AA sponsor considers Applicant\nto be trustworthy and reliable.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in some of his findings.  Among other things, he\ndenies that he has a history of alcohol abuse or that he has ever had symptoms of bipolar disorder;\nhe states that he has been abstinent from alcohol since 2007 rather than the Judge\u2019s finding of 2008;\nhe disagrees with the Judge\u2019s finding that his alcohol consumption contributed to criminal activity;\nand he takes issue with the Judge\u2019s finding that his return to drinking in 1991 after seven years\nabstinence was due to an inability to control his impulses.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based\non substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-11564 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2009).\nApplicant states, \u201c[d]ue to my inability to retain counsel . . . I have been denied proper legal\nrepresentation throughout this entire process.\u201d  Applicant Brief at 2.  We construe this as a claim that\nhe did not receive due process.  However, the record demonstrates that Applicant was provided a\ncopy of the Directive and advised of his right to submit written matters in mitigation and\nextenuation, as well as his right to be represented by counsel.  Letter to Applicant, Oct. 26, 2009;\nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) at 8-9.  Applicant submitted a response to the FORM in which\nhe addressed what he considered to be pertinent mitigating conditions.  There is no basis to conclude\nthat Applicant was denied his due process rights.   \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider record evidence, such as his favorable\npsychological evaluation.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in\nthe record.  See ISCR Case No. 09-05830 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2010).  In this case, the Judge\ndiscussed Applicant\u2019s having availed himself of professional help and his good prognosis, among\nother things.  However, he also explained why he concluded that Applicant\u2019s evidence was not\nsufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns.  He stated that: \nIn the past, Applicant stopped drinking several times for long periods after alcohol\nrehabilitation treatment and medication.  He . . . resumed his alcohol consumption\nwhich led to additional misconduct.  Not enough time has passed since his last\nrelapse to justify a finding that his alcohol-related behavior is not likely to recur.\nDecision at 7. \nApplicant\u2019s brief does not rebut the presumption that the Judge considered the entire record.  Neither\ndoes it demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in the record in an arbitrary or capricious\nmanner.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009). \n\n4\nApplicant claims that the Judge demonstrated an unfair bias against him by repeating what\nDepartment Counsel said and disregarding any part of Applicant\u2019s evidence containing information\nthat was contrary to the representations of Department Counsel.  Applicant\u2019s claim of bias lacks\nspecificity and therefore prevents the Board from meaningfully evaluating this claim.  Moreover,\nthere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to\novercome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-02253\nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2008); ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  Applicant\nhas not overcome the presumption in this case. \n  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR and the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 49-year-old senior software engineer employed by a defense contractor. He attended college on-and-off from 1985 until 1991, when he received a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has a lifelong history of alcohol abuse which includes five serious \nalcohol-related incidents of misconduct. His last incident occurred in 2007. He relapsed \nin March 2008, while undergoing court-ordered treatment. Although he has been \nabstinent since March 2008, not enough time has passed to warrant a finding that his \nalcohol-related behavior is not likely to recur. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 4, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On \nAugust 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised; and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 12, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted or denied. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 16, 2009. He elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM), dated October 23, 2009, was provided to him by letter \ndated October 26, 2009. Applicant responded to the FORM on November 18, 2009, and \nsubmitted material in refutation, extenuation, and mitigation. The case was assigned to \nme on December 14, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.d through 1.i, with some \nclarifications. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, and having considered Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR and the FORM, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old senior software engineer employed by a defense \ncontractor. He attended college on-and-off from 1985 until 1991, when he received a \nBachelor of Science degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics. He \ngraduated from college with honors, made the Dean\u2019s list five times, and is a member of \nan honor roll society. He married his first wife in October 1986, and divorced her in April \n2004. He married his current wife in February 2008. He has one adult-age child and two \nadult-age stepchildren.  \n \nIn his January 2008, clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he had \nreceived treatment for bipolar disorder since 1995, he was involved in numerous alcohol \nrelated incidents, and he was currently receiving alcohol-related treatment (Item 5 \nSections 23, 25, and 26). The subsequent background investigation addressed his \nalcohol consumption and alcohol-related misconduct. \n \nApplicant started consuming alcohol (whiskey, beer, and tequila) as a teenager. \nHe described himself as an episodic binge drinker, but he also admitted to consuming a \nsix pack of beer with a pint and up to a fifth of alcohol daily (Item 8). He consumed \nalcohol to the point of intoxication, losing his memory, and experiencing blackouts. His \nalcohol consumption led him to engage in criminal misconduct. At age 17, he was \ndrinking with friends and they stole carpet from a home construction site he was working \nat. He later turned himself in. He was convicted of the larceny, served nine months in \njail, and made restitution. \n \nIn October 1981, Applicant rode his motorcycle while intoxicated and was \ninvolved in a serious accident. He was hospitalized for a long period of time and \n\n \n3 \n \n \nrequired extensive medical care. He was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) \nand required to attend Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) meetings. He stopped drinking \nalcohol from 1984 until 1991, because his alcohol abuse was jeopardizing his life \n(Response to the FORM). Applicant underwent psychiatric treatment for bipolar disorder \nand alcohol consumption from January 1995 until October 2004. He also received \ntreatment for alcohol dependence from January 2005 until October 2006. \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant consumed alcohol until he was impaired and drove his \nvehicle off the road. He left his vehicle and started walking. He was arrested for public \nintoxication. He has little memory of that night\u2019s events because he blacked out. He was \ngiven a pre-trial diversion, paid fees and court costs, and received court-ordered alcohol \ncounseling. He participated in alcohol rehabilitation treatment from August 2006 until \nNovember 2006. \n \nIn June 2007, he was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI). He was \nsentenced to jail (suspended), paid fines and court fees, awarded probation, and \nordered to attend an alcohol rehabilitation program. His driver\u2019s license was suspended \nfor one year.  \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant consumed alcohol to excess, blacked out and was \narrested for public nudity and public intoxication. He was convicted of public \nintoxication, sentenced to jail (suspended), paid fines and court fees, and was placed on \nprobation. He was ordered to undergo an alcohol rehabilitation program, which he \nattended from October 2007 until May 2008.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s treatment records show he cooperated fully with the counselors and \nindicated he truly wanted help to control his alcohol addiction. He admitted increased \ntolerance to alcohol. He was drinking more than intended, having withdrawal symptoms, \nhis use was interfering with his obligations, and he wanted to develop coping skills to \nmaintain abstinence. He was prescribed medication to control his alcohol abuse. \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis included \u201calcohol dependence\u201d and \u201cbipolar I disorder, moderate\u201d \n(Item 8). \n \nIn March 2008, while undergoing court-ordered alcohol treatment, Applicant \nrelapsed. He disclosed his relapse to his counselors seeking further help. \nNotwithstanding, he successfully completed his treatment program. At the end of his \n2008 treatment, Applicant had improved his condition, and his prognosis was \nconsidered \u201cgood.\u201d He was referred to continued AA participation. \n \nDuring July and October 2008 follow-up interviews with a government \ninvestigator concerning his alcohol-related problems, Applicant was honest and \nforthcoming about his alcohol-related problems. He admitted that he has been \nstruggling with alcohol addiction most of his life and that he suffers memory lapses \nbecause of his alcohol abuse. Applicant has been sober since March 2008, and \nconsistently participates in AA meetings. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant attributed his alcohol problems to the emotional and physical abuse he \nsuffered in foster homes and by adopted parents after his mother abandoned him, and \nhis 2006-2007 alcohol-related problems to the break-up of his first marriage in 2004. In \nhis answers to the SOR and the FORM, Applicant expressed remorse for his alcohol-\nrelated problems. Applicant has taken personal responsibility for his actions. He averred \nhe has been abstinent since March 2008. He voluntarily disclosed his 2008 relapse \nbecause he really wanted help. He claimed he currently attends AA meetings three \ntimes per week and benefits from the fellowship. He noted he is now remarried to a \nwonderful woman and they have a good relationship. He volunteers in his community \nhelping the youth improve their leadership skills. \n \nApplicant believes himself to be reliable and trustworthy because of his continued \nsuccess. He has been successful at his job during the last 25 years, and was successful \non his own entrepreneurial business. He was hired in February 2008, by his current \nemployer (a government contractor) as senior software engineer. His supervisors \nconsider him to be an invaluable member of the team. He is reliable, trustworthy, \nethical, thorough, and technically competent. He has good analytical skills and is well \nadjusted. He is dedicated to his family. They rely on his judgment unconditionally. \n \nApplicant\u2019s AA sponsor since May 2008 describes his progress in the AA \nprogram as honest and sincere. He considers Applicant to be one of the most reliable \nand trustworthy persons he knows. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. They provide \nexplanations for each guideline and list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s goal is to achieve a \nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d1 Once the \nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden \nshifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment.2 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. \nOr. 10865 Section 7; and Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3) Thus, a decision to \ndeny a clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It \nis merely and indication the applicant has not met the stringent guidelines the President \nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n  \nUnder Guideline G the Government\u2019s concern is that excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. \n \nThe Government established its case under Guideline G by showing that \nApplicant has a history of consuming alcohol to excess, extending from 1977, when he \nwas 17, until March 2008, when he was 48 years old. His alcohol abuse led him to \n \n1 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nexercise questionable judgment as demonstrated by his involvement in five incidents of \nserious misconduct, including convictions for larceny, DUI, and public intoxication.  \n \nApplicant was abstinent from 1984 to 1991. Around 1995, he was diagnosed with \nalcohol dependence. This diagnosis was affirmed in 1981, 2006, and 2007 when he \nwas court-ordered to participate in alcohol-related treatment as a result of his alcohol-\nrelated misconduct. He stopped consuming alcohol around October 2007, while \nattending court-ordered treatment. He relapsed in March 2008, and seeking further \nassistance, disclosed his relapse to his alcohol counselor. There is no evidence that \nApplicant has consumed alcohol after his March 2008 relapse. He does not intend to \ncontinue consuming alcohol in the future. \n \nGuideline G disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 22(a): \u201calcohol-related incidents away \nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence;\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c): \u201chabitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\u201d AG \u00b6 22(d): \n\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence;\u201d AG \u00b6 22(e): \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram;\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(f): \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and \ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program,\u201d apply.  \n \n  \nThere are four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 \npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);  \n \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n  \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find none of the \nGuideline G mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s initial diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence was in 1995. This diagnosis was affirmed in 1981, 2006, and 2007 when \nhe was ordered to participate in additional alcohol-related treatment as a result of his \nalcohol-related misconduct.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption appears to be tied to his depression and \ndiagnosed bipolar disorder. Since 1977, he has been repeatedly involved in serious \nalcohol-related incidents of misconduct. He has recognized the danger of his alcohol \nabuse and has stopped drinking several times. He also sought professional help several \ntimes. Notwithstanding, Applicant either has not been able to learn from his mistakes or \nhe has not been able to control his impulses. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents show \nalcohol impairs his judgment and that he has not been capable of controlling his \nimpulses. \n \n  \nApplicant remarried and is in a stable relationship. He claimed he does not have \nany emotional or personal problems that could trigger his alcohol consumption. He is \nalso doing well at work. He has acknowledged his alcoholism, successfully participated \nin alcohol counseling, has been abstinent since March 2008, and has been participating \nin aftercare counseling. His prognosis is good. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s favorable \nevidence is not sufficient to show it is unlikely his questionable behavior will recur. In the \npast, Applicant stopped drinking several times for long periods after alcohol \nrehabilitation treatment and medication. He was not able to control his impulses and \nresumed his alcohol consumption which led to additional misconduct. Not enough time \nhas passed since his last relapse to justify a finding that his alcohol-related behavior is \nnot likely to recur. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(c) were \naddresses under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \nApplicant has been successful in his job for a government contractor since 2008. \nHe is a mature man and a good worker. He has the support of his supervisors who trust \nhim and laud his performance. He has sought help to overcome his alcoholism and \nseems to be doing well. There is no evidence he has ever compromised or caused \nothers to compromise classified information. These factors show some responsibility, \ngood judgment, and mitigation.  \n \nOverall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that, at this time, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom his alcohol consumption. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He wrote, \nApplicant \u201cis a consummate professional very deserving of the public trust that has been \ngranted him by the position he holds at [his place of employment].\u201d (AE C.) \n \n \nApplicant has a pilot\u2019s license and flew aircraft about seven years after leaving \nthe Air National Guard. (Tr. 69.) He managed a local airport for several years. (Tr. 45.) \nIn 2001, Applicant was diagnosed with Meniere\u2019s disease, along with a hearing loss, \nwhich are conditions that may be attributable to spending years around airplanes. \nCurrently, a physician has evaluated Applicant for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD) and recommended that he seek therapy for it. Applicant intends to follow-up \nwith the recommendation. (Tr. 67.)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter retiring in 2000, Applicant worked in various positions in private industry. In \nMarch 2008, he began working an entry level clerk\u2019s position for a federal contractor, \nwho processes medical claims for service members. (GE I.) His supervisor has rated \nhim as \u201cAchieves Expectations\u201d in all of his Performance Evaluations to date. (AE B(2).) \nA supervisor for another division at Applicant\u2019s work place has known him for ten years \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nwhile serving in the National Guard together. He has daily contact with Applicant and \nstated that he is \u201cloyal and has always put service before self.\u201d (AE C.) \n \n \nIn December 2002, Applicant was cited for two counts of Reckless Driving-\nEndanger Safety. One count was dismissed. The second count was amended to \nInattentive Driving for not wearing a seat belt. He pleaded \u201cno contest\u201d and paid a $287 \nfine. (GE 4.)  \n \nOn March 14, 2007, Applicant became frustrated waiting in line to drop off his \nchild at school. He subsequently became embroiled in a verbal altercation with another \nparent, who filed a complaint against him. He received a ticket in the mail nine days \nlater charging him with Disorderly Conduct. (Tr. 41.) Applicant pleaded \u201cno contest\u201d to \nan Obstructing A Street charge and paid a $203 fine. (GE 6.)  \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant confronted one of his son\u2019s friends about returning his \nson\u2019s baseball glove. The friend\u2019s mother telephoned the police because she heard \nApplicant in a heated argument with her son. After the police arrived, they issued a \nDisorderly Conduct citation to Applicant, which he resolved by paying a $109 fine on \nMay 22, 2008. (GE 5, 7.) \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant and his wife went to a payday loan store to make a \npayment on a loan and discuss the company\u2019s telephone calls to him at his place of \nemployment regarding the debt. Applicant and the store\u2019s representative engaged in an \naltercation, during which she asked Applicant to leave the store. He did. Unbeknownst \nto him until he read the SOR, she filed a police report, and on March 3, 2009, the police \nissued him a No-Trespass ban. (GE 8.) \n  \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified. She was in the Army from 1984 to 1986. She \nsubsequently worked for a military exchange for eleven years. She has a real estate \nlicense, but is not working in the field because of the depressed economy. She \naccompanied her husband to the payday loan store in February 2009. She asserted that \nthe store\u2019s representative was rude, and she later filed a complaint against the \nrepresentative. She considers her husband to be a trustworthy, honest man. (Tr. 72, \n76.) \n \nThe president of the village where Applicant lives testified. She has known \nApplicant for 11 years. She is aware of the March 2007 incident at the school and \nbelieves that police bias was exhibited toward Applicant. She thinks that the matter \nshould have been resolved informally with the village board and not sent to the village \nattorney. Over the years, she has always found Applicant to be a respectful and \ntrustworthy person. (Tr. 17-30.) \n \nApplicant completed a SF-85P on April 1, 2008. In response to \u201cQuestion 20: \nYour Police Record: In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or \nconvicted of any offense(s)? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150),\u201d he disclosed the \n2002 incident, but did not disclose the 2007 charge. He did not realize that he should \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nhave disclosed the incident because he had not been arrested or taken to the police \nstation. He did not intend to mislead the Government, but misunderstood the question. \n(Tr. 52-53.) \n \n \nApplicant testified candidly. He appeared remorseful and embarrassed over the \nincidents underlying this proceeding. He likes his position and understands the \nimportance of safeguarding sensitive information. He is proud of his commendable \nservice in the Air Force and Air National Guard and continues to live by its Core Values. \n(Tr. 32.)   \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I, ADP II, and ADP III are classified as \u201csensitive \npositions.\u201d (See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must \nbe met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, \nthe person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the \nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d \n(See \nRegulation \n\u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1.) \nThe \nDeputy \nUnder \nSecretary \nof \nDefense \n(Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates \ntrustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense \nSecurity Service and Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense \ncontractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive \nbefore any final unfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 \nC8.2.1.)  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] \ndecision.\u201d \n \n \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant was charged with criminal conduct in 2007, 2008, and 2009, two of \nwhich resulted in the imposition of small fines. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove two disqualifications. \nAfter the Government raised a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to \npresent evidence to rebut or mitigate the potential disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6 32 \nprovides a condition that could mitigate security concerns arising from criminal conduct: \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \nOver a year has passed since the February 2009 incident, which is the latest \nallegation listed in the SOR. The circumstances of that situation are unclear based on \nthe testimony of Applicant\u2019s wife who was present when the situation arose. There is no \nallegation of any misconduct since then. Applicant is remorseful and embarrassed about \nthe incidents. He presented evidence of successful performance evaluations since \nstarting his employment and complimentary letters from two co-workers who have \nknown him for many years. This evidence is sufficient to establish the application of said \nmitigating condition to the security concerns raised under this guideline. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b that Applicant falsified his answer to a \nquestion on the SF 85P, regarding disclosure of a 2007 criminal charge. It contended \nthat his omission may raise a security concern and be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that he intentionally omitted information about the 2007 \nDisorderly Conduct charge. When a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the \ngovernment has the burden of proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not \nestablish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine \nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of \nmind at the time the omission occurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, \n2004)). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nWhen completing his SF 85, Applicant misunderstood the question in Section 20. \nHe did not think the 2007 incident fell within the purview of inquiry because he was \nnever arrested or went to court on the charge. He acknowledged that he misread it. \nAfter listening to his testimony and observing his demeanor, I find that the omission of \nthe information was not intentional. Hence, the evidence does not establish deliberate \nfalsification. SOR \u00b6 2.b is found in his favor. \n \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.c that the three criminal incidents \noccurring in 2007, 2008, 2009, and a 2002 traffic violation (albeit minor infractions) also \nraised security concerns under this Guideline. Based on the evidence, those incidents \ncreate a pattern of rule violations and raise a security concern involving Applicant\u2019s \njudgment under AG \u00b6 15.  \nAG \u00b6 17 includes a condition that could mitigate security concerns arising under \nthis guideline: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant expressed remorse and embarrassment over the incidents. He is \nobtaining treatment for PTSD, which may be a contributing factor to any underlying \nstressors related to the previous behavior. More than a year has passed since the \nFebruary 2009 incident and there is no evidence of other misconduct. Both of these \nfacts tend to indicate that similar problems are unlikely to recur. Said mitigating \ncondition has some application to the raised security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 60-year-old man, \nwho commendably and honorably served his country for over thirty years. He has been \nmarried for 11 years and has two children. He has received acceptable performance \nevaluations from his current supervisor since beginning his position in 2008.  He is \naware of the importance of safeguarding sensitive information, having held a Top Secret \nsecurity clearance during military service. Other than the four minor incidents that \noccurred between 2002 and 2009, Applicant\u2019s record does not contain sufficient \nevidence to raise other concerns or indicate that he is a trustworthy risk. To the \ncontrary, he takes his job and responsibilities seriously. Two of his colleagues consider \nhim to be a trustworthy man and not a risk. Given his recent evaluation for PTSD and \nwillingness to engage in counseling and treatment, along with his awareness of the \nnegative affect that similar incidents or allegations could have on his employment, the \nlikelihood of recurrence is minimal. \n \nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability \nand trustworthiness concerns arising from criminal and personal conduct. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a \npublic trust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c:  \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to ADPI/II/III sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n                                  \n \n          \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",
