    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR Response, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f without further comment, but for SOR \u00b6 1.e, which he admitted in part and denied in part. His SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 60 years old. He has a high school education. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1984 to 2005 and was honorably discharged as a tech sergeant (E-6). He has worked for a defense contractor in industrial security since February 2018. He was unemployed for most of 2017. He has held a clearance since he joined the Air Force but for 2012-2015 when he was unemployed. (GE 1; Tr. 41, 60) 2 Applicant and his first wife married in 1989.

On \nOctober 15, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline G (alcohol involvement). The CAF issued the SOR \nunder Executive Order (Exec.

The case was assigned to me on April 18, 2023. On April 27, 2023, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling a hearing for May 31, 2023, by video-teleconference through \nan online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Department Counsel also offered two documents for\nadministrative notice (AN) purposes. Those materials are discussed below. Applicant\ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B. All exhibits were admitted\nwithout objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open to allow\nApplicant the opportunity to submit further documentation in support of his case. He\nsubmitted one reference letter, which was marked as AE C. Department Counsel did\nnot object to admission of AE C but provided post-hearing argument. (June 7, 2023 e-\nmail, HE III). Applicant Exhibit C was admitted without objection. The record closed on\nJune 12, 2023. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 13, 2023. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdministrative Notice Documents \nThe day before the hearing, Department Counsel submitted two documents for \nadministrative notice (AN) purposes, both concerning alcohol use disorders. The \ndocuments, a Fact Sheet from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \nand an excerpt from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth \nEdition (DSM-V), are marked as AN I and AN II, respectively. \nApplicant initially objected to the documents on the grounds that they were \nuntimely, since they were provided several days after my discovery deadline. (E-mails \nof May 30, 2023, Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II). At the start of the hearing, I heard \nargument from counsel and the Applicant on the matter. Applicant ultimately said he \nwished to proceed with the hearing as scheduled. I ruled that I would consider the \ndocuments for administrative notice but would give Applicant time after the hearing to \nsubmit evidence in mitigation. (Tr. 11-27) \nFindings of Fact \nIn his SOR Response, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f without further \ncomment, but for SOR \u00b6 1.e, which he admitted in part and denied in part. His SOR \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.

He served on active \nduty in the U.S. Air Force from 1984 to 2005 and was honorably discharged as a tech \nsergeant (E-6). He has worked for a defense contractor in industrial security since \nFebruary 2018. He was unemployed for most of 2017.

They separated in 2012 and divorced \nin 2016. He has an adult son from that marriage. He remarried in September 2020. He \nand his wife moved from state 1 to state 2 in February 2022. He remains with his \nemployer, and he works from home full time. They moved in anticipation of retirement in \nabout two or three years. (Tr. 43-47, 56, 58; GE 1) \nOn his 2019 SCA, Applicant listed his three most recent alcohol-related driving \noffenses, in 2015, 2017, and 2019. (GE 1 at 32-40) He had a background interview in \nJanuary 2020. He authenticated and adopted it as accurate in a June 2021 interrogatory \nresponse without making changes. In the interview, he discussed each offense as well \nas his counseling, probation requirements, and alcohol involvement. (GE 2; Tr. 62) \nApplicant was cited for drinking in public in 1999. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (GE 2, GE 3) He \nwas in a public park with friends after a softball game. He acknowledged that there was \nalcohol in his cooler and he acknowledged receiving a citation, but he denied that he \nhad been drinking. His most recent background interview summary references an \nacknowledgment during a prior investigation that he had been drinking at the time. He \nsaid that at his hearing that he would drink beers after softball but did not do so on that \noccasion. Like others who were there, he paid the $50 fine rather than contest the \nmatter in court. (Tr. 62-66; GE 2) \nAll three of Applicant\u2019s DWIs occurred during his separation, after his divorce and \nbefore his 2020 remarriage. (Tr. 114) He was also depressed due to the end of his first \nmarriage. He had attempted to reconcile with his first wife but was not able to do so. (Tr. \n115-116) \nIn April 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with misdemeanor Driving \nWhile Intoxicated (DWI), first offense. He had been at a late lunch with a friend. He was \nthere for several hours. He said he had two beers and a shot to celebrate the friend\u2019s \nbirthday. He was pulled over on his way home after making an illegal U-turn. The officer \nsmelled alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath, and Applicant blew a 0.14 blood alcohol content \n(BAC) on a breathalyzer. In July 2015, he pled guilty to a reduced charge of \nmisdemeanor reckless driving. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He received a 30-day suspended jail term, a \n$500 fine, and an undetermined term of probation. He attended a 10-hour alcohol safety \nawareness program (ASAP) from October to December 2015. (Tr. 66-69; GE 1; GE 4) \nApplicant said he curtailed his drinking after that offense. At the time, he said he \nconsumed about two to three beers four or five times a week. He acknowledged\ndrinking due to depression about the end of his marriage. He said his divorce was not\ndue to drinking but more due to unemployment issues and lack of conversation. (Tr. 56-\n57, 70-71)  \n \n \nIn June 2016, Applicant attended a concert and was there for several hours. He \nhad been drinking beer. He was stopped at a checkpoint on his way home. He had a \nBAC of 0.14. He was arrested and charged with DWI. He pled guilty to a reduced \ncharge of reckless driving in November 2016. He received a 90-day suspended jail \nsentence and six months of supervised probation, until May 2017. He was also fined. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe had a restricted license with an ignition interlock device for six months. He attended \nan eight-hour ASAP program in early 2017. (Tr. 73-76; GE 5) (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nApplicant was referred to group counseling from November 2016 to April 2017. \nHe was also subject to random alcohol testing about once a week. He abstained from \nalcohol for six months, though he failed one test. He was also required to attend \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. It was reinforced that he should avoid drinking \nand driving and making the same mistakes. He learned how quickly his BAC will \nincrease when he drinks, but he did not believe he had a drinking problem. (Tr. 76-81, \n105-107) \nApplicant resumed social drinking at some point after the counseling sessions \nended. (Tr. 82-83) One evening in February 2019, he attended a birthday party at a \nbrewery. He left about 8:30 PM. He had consumed between two and four beers. He was \npulled over for crossing the center line. His BAC was 0.19. Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with DWI. He pled no contest, He was sentenced to 90 days in jail, all but six \ndays suspended. He served three days. He received 12 months of supervised probation \nand was fined $1,000. His license was suspended for 12 months, with an ignition \ninterlock device for six months. He was ordered to attend eight hours of ASAP and \nreferred to Counseling Center N. (Tr. 71-72, 84-90; GE 6) (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \nApplicant acknowledged one interlock ignition failure, in June 2019, though he \ndenied that it was caused by drinking. He said it was caused by medication. (Tr. 100-\n104) He completed the counseling from July to November 2019. It was a small group, of \nabout five people. He denied that he was told during counseling that he should stop \ndrinking, and said the counselor said it was not wrong to have an occasional drink. The \nfocus was on not drinking and driving and on limiting alcohol consumption. He found the \ncounseling informative, and said, \u201cI took a lot from that to make sure I never put myself \nin that situation again.\u201d The counseling center notified state authorities that he \ncompleted the program, but he did not receive a certificate or other documentation. (Tr. \n49-55)  \nApplicant denied that he had ever been diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder, \nincluding during his 2019 counseling. (Answer to SOR \u00b6 1.e; Tr. 24, 90) Even if that \nwere established, he also denied that he was aware of it. He denied meeting with a \nmedical professional while in counseling. (Tr. 53-54, 91-94, 98) \nThe interrogatory response (GE 2) asked the following question: \nAvailable information indicates that from August 2019 to September 2019, \nyou received alcohol counseling at [Counseling Center N]. You were \ndiagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder \u2013 Moderate.  \nApplicant checked \u201cYES\u201d without further comment. (GE 2 at 2) At his hearing, he said \nhe did not intend to \u201cadmit\u201d the diagnosis when he checked \u201cYES.\u201d (Tr. 91-94, 98) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFurther, the summary of Applicant\u2019s January 2020 background interview, which \nhe adopted as accurate and authenticated without making edits or further comment, \ncontains the following statements: \nSubject has never been professionally diagnosed with abusing alcohol. \nSubject has never been professionally diagnosed as being alcohol \ndependent. (GE 2 at 10) \nThe Government\u2019s case does not include independent documentary evidence, \nfrom Counseling Center N or elsewhere, to support the allegation that Applicant had \nbeen diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. (Tr. 95-96, 123-126) There is also no \ndocumentation in the record of a recommendation that Applicant should wholly abstain \nfrom alcohol use, for medical or other reasons, and he testified that he never received \nsuch a recommendation or instruction. (Tr. 117) \nApplicant said he has been \u201cclean\u201d for four years. (Tr. 100) He does not believe \nthat he has a drinking problem. (Tr. 107) He did not return to AA, as he felt his issues \nwere drinking and driving and not due to other issues with alcohol, like others. (Tr. 108) \nHe has not pursued any counseling beyond what he received at Counseling Center N or \nthrough court-ordered AA. He is not in counseling or treatment currently. (Tr. 107-108, \n117) He said his support network is his wife, his family, and good friends. He remains \nclose to his son and his grandchildren, who live elsewhere (Tr. 118) \nApplicant drinks \u201ca beer or two once in a while.\u201d (Tr. 107) At times he does not \ndrink for one, two, or three weeks. (Tr. 109) He last consumed alcohol the weekend \nbefore the hearing, when he had two beers while at home watching sports on television. \n(Tr. 111-113) When he drinks, he drinks to moderation, either at home, or when his wife \nis the designated driver. (Tr. 42-43, 59, 113-114) He also acknowledged that he has \nmellowed and is \u201cmore settled\u201d since he is \u201cgetting older.\u201d (Tr. 118) \nAs a result of his most recent counseling, Applicant stopped going out often. He \nalso met his wife, which had a significant positive impact on him. They met in 2018 and \nhave been together since 2019. (Tr. 56-57) He said his marriage has been a positive, \nstabilizing change in his life. He and his wife stay home or go to dinner with friends. He \nbelieves moving to State 2 has helped. They live a \u201cslower-paced lifestyle that they \nenjoy. (Tr. 116) Applicant has had no subsequent arrests or offenses since 2019 and \nhas no restrictions on his driver\u2019s license. (AE A, AE B) \nApplicant said he has held a clearance for most of the last 40 years and has \nnever had a security violation or an employment issue. He values his clearance and \nunderstands its importance. He believes he has made adjustments in his life and is not \na risk to national security. (Tr. 132-133) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, Mr. P, provided a letter of reference. Mr. P said Applicant \nis a reliable, trusted employee and a solid team player.

(AE C) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder; and  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nIn 1999, Applicant was with friends after a softball game. He was cited for \ndrinking in public. Alcohol was present but he denies that he was drinking. He chose to \npay a small fine rather than to contest the matter in court. He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a and \nAG \u00b6 22(a) is established (though his guilt is not established merely because he chose \nto pre-pay the fine to resolve a misdemeanor citation). \nBetween 2015 and 2019, Applicant was arrested three times for DWI. He pled \nguilty to lesser offenses of reckless driving the first two times and pled no contest to the \nthird offense. AG \u00b6 22(a) is established for those offenses. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that in 2019, Applicant received alcohol counseling and was \ndiagnosed with moderate alcohol use disorder. He admits the counseling but denies the \ndiagnosis. Alcohol counseling is not, itself, a security concern, and no disqualifying \ncondition is established by its presence. Indeed, it is mitigating. \nThe only evidence that Applicant received a diagnosis that he had an alcohol \nuse disorder was its reference in the DOHA interrogatory that he received, which \nincluded a question referring to both counseling and an alcohol use disorder diagnosis. \nHe answered \u201cYes\u201d without further comment, and the Government makes much of this \n\u201cadmission.\u201d \nBut the same interrogatory also included a statement in Applicant\u2019s background \ninterview summary, stating that he had \u201cnever been professionally diagnosed as \nabusing alcohol.\u201d He authenticated his interview summary in full, including this \nstatement, also without comment. Most importantly, the Government did not produce \nindependent documentary evidence of an alcohol use disorder diagnosis as part of its \ncase (as it had the burden to do, since Applicant denied that portion of SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nDocumentation from the counseling center would have been the best evidence of the \ndiagnosis, but there is no such documentation in the record. Without it, a diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder is not established, and AG \u00b6 22(d) does not apply. \nMoreover, even if a diagnosis of moderate alcohol use disorder were established, \nit is neither alleged in the SOR nor established by the record evidence that Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued consumption of alcohol, at moderate levels, at home or when out with his wife \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhen she is the designated driver, is contrary to treatment or counseling \nrecommendations. \nTherefore, while I have considered the Government\u2019s administrative notice \nmaterials regarding alcohol use disorders (AN I and AN II), I have given them relatively \nlittle weight, as the premise for their relevance to this case is not established by the \nrecord evidence. Nor are they accompanied by a professional evaluation of how they \nare to be applied to this Applicant and his circumstances. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, the citation for drinking in public, is mitigated by the passage of time. \nThe other offenses are more recent and more serious. Applicant incurred three DWI \narrests between 2015 and 2019, all in similar circumstances (driving home after social \ndrinking). He has participated in several ASAP classes and has had several counseling \nsessions. He completed each requirement successfully and is no longer on probation. \nHe has not had any recurrent instances of alcohol-related driving offenses in four years. \nAll of these offenses occurred either during or after the collapse of his first marriage, \nwhich Applicant clearly struggled with emotionally. This is less so for his most recent \noffense (2019) though, tellingly, it occurred before his remarriage. \nApplicant testified credibly that he has changed his lifestyle. He has remarried \nand moved to a new location in another state. He credits his marriage as a positive and \nstabilizing impact on his life. He is older and nearing retirement. This is not to say that \nhis offenses are attributable to immaturity. They are not. But it has been four years \nsince his most recent offense. Applicant\u2019s current alcohol consumption is either at \nhome, or while out with his wife, with a designated driver. It is also moderate and \nreasonable, and, as noted, it is not contrary to treatment or counseling \nrecommendations. I also credit Applicant\u2019s many years in the Air Force and the defense \nindustry, with a clearance. I conclude that AG \u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) apply to mitigate the \nGuideline G security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for continued access to classified information is granted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant continued \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Medical debt in collection in the approximate amount of $31,688. This \ndebt arose after Applicant was in a car accident in 2016. He was taken by helicopter from \nthe accident scene to a large city hospital for emergency care. The cost of the \ntransportation expense was not covered by his insurance. In 2020 Applicant settled the \ndebt for $6,000 and paid it with monthly payments. In November 2020 he made an initial \npayment of $265. Thereafter, he made weekly payments of $65. He provided a record \nfrom the creditor evidencing each payment, along with a final payment of $2,953 on \nNovember 5, 2021. He made the final payment with funds from a tax refund. His total \npayments were $6,338. He also provided a letter from the creditor stating that this debt \nhad been paid in full and the account was closed. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 29-34; GE \n3 at 4; GE 4 at 2; AE B; AE C.) \n1.b. Federal tax debt for TY 2017 in the approximate amount of $4,961. \nApplicant acknowledged that he owed the IRS additional taxes for TY 2017. He testified \nthat this debt was paid through his tax refunds in subsequent years. He provided letters \nfrom his tax preparer bearing the date of December 29, 2022, which was the date the \nletters were reprinted for purposes of submission in this security clearance proceeding. \nThe annual letters summarize Applicant\u2019s tax status and cover TYs 2014 through 2021. \nThe letters state that Applicant was due refunds from the IRS for every year except TY \n2017, when he owed an additional tax of $4,637. Applicant volunteered in his initial \nsecurity interview on March 21, 2019, that he owed the IRS about $4,000 for TY 2017. \nAdditional taxes were owed that year because he withdrew funds from his 401K due to \nlosing his job in 2017 and he was unemployed for a period. Applicant relied upon his 401k \ntrustee to withhold sufficient taxes at the time of the withdrawal and the funds withheld \nand paid to the IRS and the state proved to be insufficient. As of the date of his security \ninterview, Applicant had not paid the tax, but he subsequently learned that his tax refunds \nfor TYs 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, which totaled about $6,300, were applied to his TY \n2017 tax debt rather than paid to him as refunds. Applicant believes that this tax debt has \nbeen fully satisfied. He was unable to provide an account transcript from the IRS to \nconfirm the payment of this tax debt because he does not possess the necessary \nidentifying information, such as a credit card or any other required document, to open an \nonline account with the IRS. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 34-42; GE 2 at 6; AE A at 2-6.) \n1.c. State tax debt for TY 2017 in the approximate amount of $1,944. \nApplicant\u2019s state issued a garnishment of his wages in August 2019 to pay this debt. \nApplicant decided to pay the debt through deductions from his paycheck. The debt was\ninitially paid by wage garnishments. At some point, Applicant entered into a payment plan \nwith the state to pay the balance of his tax debt. He paid it off before 2022. He presented \na copy of a state tax refund check, dated October 25, 2022, he received for TY 2021, \nwhich evidences that he owed no additional taxes to the state at that point.

The Government \nalso alleged that Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption can raise questions about his reliability \nand trustworthiness. Specifically, the Government alleged that Applicant consumed \nalcohol during a period he was also taking Hydrocodone, a pain killer, which was against \nmedical advice; that he was treated at a medical facility after a possible suicide attempt \nthat involved alcohol; that he was charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) of \nalcohol; and that he continued to drink alcohol to intoxication. In the Answer, Applicant \nadmitted the four allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a- 2.d) with two explanations. \nApplicant testified that he stopped drinking alcohol on January 30, 2022, He \nstopped drinking \u201ccold turkey\u201d because he felt that alcohol was toxic and he did not want \nto consume it any more. He also stopped dating a woman who wanted to go out to bars \nand drink alcohol. He is happier and his child is happier that he has stopped drinking. He \nhas no intention of ever drinking alcohol again. (Tr. at 43-44.) \n2.a. Alcohol consumption with Hydrocodone. Applicant admitted in the Answer \nthat during the period from August 2012 to June 2015, he drank alcohol while taking the \nprescription medication Hydrocodone even though that was against his doctor\u2019s advice. \nHe explained that during that time period, he had two back surgeries and was suffering \nfrom a lot of pain. He found that combining alcohol with this painkiller medication helped \nreduce his pain and made him more mobile. In or about late 2015 or 2016, Applicant \nstopped taking Hydrocodone. As discussed below, he was in a bad car accident in 2016 \nand he refused to take any pain killers. He testified that he presently only takes two Advil \ncapsules for pain. (Tr. at 44-45, 50.) \n2.b. Suicide attempt while intoxicated. In August 2016, Applicant had a bad\nevening at home due to being upset about his recent divorce and being unhappy with his\nrelationship with a woman he was dating. Applicant\u2019s brother came to check on him and\nfound him intoxicated and with a knife in his hand. He had self-inflicted cuts on his arms.\nHis brother called the police, and Applicant testified that he agreed to go with them to a\nstabilization facility for a brief hold to make sure he would not commit any serious self\nharm. Applicant does not believe than any prescription pain pills were involved in this\nincident, just alcohol. Applicant has subsequently committed himself to eliminating toxicity\nin his life and the people around him who cause it. He has had no suicidal ideations since\nthat evening and has not engaged in any further self harm. (Tr. at 45-47, 50-51.)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.c. DUI arrest and charges. In October 2016, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with DUI. His girlfriend at that time was driving, and she had a bad accident. Her \ndriver\u2019s license had been suspended, and she had been drinking. She told the police that \nApplicant was driving. He was intoxicated at the time and went along with the girlfriend\u2019s \nstory. He was actually in the passenger seat at the time of the accident and hit his head \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe front windshield so hard, he lost consciousness. He was taken by helicopter to a large \ncity hospital where he regained consciousness. He hired a lawyer and a collision expert. \nThe expert convinced the prosecutor that Applicant was in the passenger seat at the time \nof the accident. The charges were dropped. (Tr. at 47-50.) \n2.d. Continued excessive alcohol consumption. The Government alleged that \nApplicant continued to drink excessively until at least December 2020. Applicant admitted \nin the Answer that he did continue to drink, but only \u201ca couple of beers\u201d at a time. He \ndenied any excessive drinking in recent years, and, as noted, he stopped drinking entirely \nin January 2022. (Tr.at 48-49.) \nParagraph 3 \u2013 Guideline I, Psychological Conditions \n3.a. Alcohol consumption with Hydrocodone. The Government cross-alleged \nits allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a in SOR \u00b6 3.a under Guideline I. Department Counsel was at a \nloss to explain the Government\u2019s theory of this allegation and did not ask any questions \nor make any argument based upon the alleged facts under this guideline. (Tr. at 55, 65, \n71.) \nParagraph 4 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nIn paragraph 4 of the SOR, the Government alleged numerous acts of misconduct \nby Applicant, including four falsification allegations. In his Answer, Applicant denied the \nfalsification allegations with one exception. The Government also cross-alleged his debts \nset forth in paragraph 1 and the alcohol consumption allegations in paragraph 2. (Answer \nat 3.) \nThe details regarding each of the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 4 are as \nfollows: \n4.a. Falsification of e-QIP question in Section 26 regarding unpaid taxes. \nApplicant testified that to his knowledge, he was paying his Federal and state taxes and \nthe appropriate answer was to write \u201cNo,\u201d he did not fail to pay his taxes. He thought he \nwas answering the question truthfully. During his security interview about one month after \nhe submitted the e-QIP, Applicant \u201cvolunteered\u201d that he had a federal tax bill of about \n$4,000 and that he had plans to pay the past-due taxes. In a follow-up interview, he stated \nthat he had not failed to pay his taxes, he merely \u201cshort paid,\u201d i.e., under withheld the full \namount of the taxes due. (Tr. at 54, 58-59; GE 2 at 6, 9.) \n4.b. Falsification of e-QIP Question regarding financial delinquencies. \nApplicant admitted this allegation. He testified that when he prepared the e-QIP he was \ntold by others to only provide what he had to. The co-workers who gave him that advice \nwere older employees who had worked at this company for a long time and had retired. \nApplicant was told that he was just an entry-level laborer, and he did not need to worry \nabout the details like listing his debts. He admitted he did not take the process seriously. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe has since received a promotion and has a better understanding of the security\nclearance process and the importance of total honesty in preparing a security clearance\napplication. He learned from the security interview process that the advice he was given\nwas wrong and that \u201ceven if you are at the bottom of the food chain, it\u2019s very serious.\u201d\nWith his promotion and his work in the inventory field, he understands the sensitivity of\nthe information with which he works. He said, \u201cI 100% get it.\u201d If he was filling out the\napplication for a security clearance today, he would provide even more information than\nwhat was asked. (Tr.at 54-57.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his initial security interview about one month after he submitted his e-QIP, \nApplicant \u201cvolunteered\u201d that he had two tax debts and a debt in collection for helicopter \ntransportation services following a serious accident in 2016. (GE 2 at 6-7.) \n4.c. Falsification of e-QIP Section 24 question regarding alcohol treatment or\ncounseling. Applicant was advised by older workers that he should not disclose his brief\nstay at the stabilization facility in response to the questions in Section 24 about alcohol \ntreatment. He did not want to disclose that experience, but he also did not view the \nservices he received there as counseling or treatment. He thought he was there to \u201cjust \nsleep it off.\u201d When he woke up there, he thought the facility was just a \u201cdrunk tank\u201d to hold\npeople while they sober up. He was only there overnight and was released in the morning.\nThe reason Applicant was being held at the stabilization facility was to determine if he\npotentially posed a threat to himself. If he was not a threat, the facility had to release him, \nwhich is what happened the next morning. He did not understand that this was a \ncounseling or treatment facility. He thought his answer was truthful. (Tr. at 58-59, 61-62.)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.d. Deliberate Omission during March 21, 2019 security interview regarding \ntreatment at the stabilization facility. In his Answer Applicant denied the allegation and \nwrote I \u201cdid not deliberately omit [this information], I wasn\u2019t aware that I had to [disclose \nit.].\u201d The information he failed to disclose was the self-inflicted cuts and his suicidal \nideation that evening. At his security interview, he came to realize that his experience at \nthe stabilization facility could be viewed as a hospitalization for a mental health condition, \nand he volunteered information to the investigator about what happened to him that night \nat his home and at the stabilization facility. Department Counsel conceded that \nApplicant\u2019s disclosures were significant and that any facts not discussed did not rise to \nthe level of a security-significant omission of material facts (Answer at 3; Tr. at 59-66; GE \n2 at 3-4.) \n \n. \n4.e. Cross-allegation of the financial considerations allegations in paragraph \n1. Department Counsel did not pursue this allegation at the hearing. The allegation has \nno merit. The issues relating to Applicant\u2019s financial consideration are fully addressed \nunder Guideline F and do not raise separate issues of misconduct cognizable under \nGuideline E. (Tr. at 61-65.) \n4.f. Cross-allegation of the alcohol consumption allegations in paragraph 2. \nDepartment Counsel did not pursue this allegation at the hearing. The allegation has no \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nmerit. The issues relating to Applicant\u2019s past alcohol consumption are fully addressed \nunder Guideline G and do not raise separate issues of misconduct cognizable under \nGuideline E. (Tr. at 61-65.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) . . . failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required, \nAs of the date of the SOR, Applicant owed approximately $39,000 for three past-\ndue debts. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties:\n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAll three of the above mitigating conditions have been fully established. Applicant \nincurred a large med-evac helicopter bill, due to an accident he did not cause, that was \nnot covered by his medical insurance, and he could not afford to pay it. His 401K trustee \nunder withheld the amount of taxes he had to pay when he withdrew funds from his 401K \naccount during his post-accident period of unemployment. He has acted responsibly and \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay his debts in a manner he could afford. All three SOR \ndebts are now paid and resolved. His behavior is unlikely to recur. He is being financially \nresponsible. His past behavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment. Paragraph 1 of the SOR is found in favor of Applicant. \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes five conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nThe record evidence does not support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and 22(f). \nApplicant has never been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. The record evidence \nsupports the application of AG \u00b6 22(a) in that he was once arrested for DUI, even though \nthe charge was ultimately dropped due to being factually erroneous. The evidence also \nsupports application of AG \u00b6 22(c) in that Applicant, in the past, occasionally abused \nalcohol for self-medicated management of pain. The intent of AG \u00b6 22(e) is arguably \nlimited to treatment advice after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, which is not \napplicable under the facts of this case. However, he did use alcohol after being advised \nby a medical professional not to do so while taking Hydrocodone for pain relief following \nback surgeries. This behavior showed a lack of judgment and renders this disqualifying \ncondition at least partially applicable. Accordingly, the record evidence shifts the burden \nof mitigation to Applicant. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 have possible application: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nApplicant has provided sufficient evidence in mitigation under the above conditions \nto mitigate his past misuse of alcohol. He has established a clear pattern of abstinence \nand has provided a credible statement of his intent not to ever drink alcohol again. He \nbelieves that alcohol is \u201ctoxic\u201d to him and his healthy living. He no longer wants alcohol to \nplay any role in his life. He has eliminated relationships that have involved the use of \nalcohol and is much happier. His alcohol use is unlikely to recur, and his past alcohol \nconsumption does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nParagraph 2 is found in favor of Applicant. \nParagraph 3 - Guideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27 as follows: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counselling. \nAG \u00b6 28 describes two conditions that could have application under the admitted \nfacts and raise a security concern that may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan, related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) is not established because the behavior is covered under Guideline G, \nand has been mitigated. AG \u00b6 28(d) is not established because Applicant\u2019s treatment plan \nunder which he was prescribed Hydrocodone was related to his physical condition \nfollowing back surgery and was not related to a \u201cpsychological/psychiatric condition.\u201d \nAccordingly, the alleged facts do not raise separate security concerns cognizable under \nGuideline I. \nParagraph 4 \u2013 Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other government representative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \nWith respect to the four falsification allegations in the SOR, Applicant denied three \nof them in the Answer, i.e., SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a, 4.c, and 4.d. Accordingly, the Government has \nthe burden of proving that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the facts that were \nalleged in the SOR in his e-QIP or at his March 21, 2019 security interview. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 4.a relates to Applicant\u2019s TY 2017 taxes. He credibly \ntestified that he believed the correct answer to the question in Section 26 of the e-QIP \n(\u201cIn the last seven years have you failed to file or pay Federal state or other taxes when \nrequired by law or ordinance?\u201d) was, \u201cNo.\u201d He argued that he did not fail to pay his Federal \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nor state taxes, he merely withheld an insufficient amount out of his 401K withdrawal to \ncover his entire tax liability to the IRS and his state. Also, when he completed his e-QIP, \nhe was in the process of paying the remainder of his tax liability. He did not believe that \nthese actions constituted a failure to pay his taxes. I note that the question does not ask \nif he owes any taxes, merely did he fail to pay them. Applicant\u2019s rationale for his negative \nresponse to this question is sufficiently credible and reasonable to negate the \nGovernment\u2019s inference that the omission was deliberate, arising solely from the omission \nof facts about his tax debts. As to SOR \u00b6 4.a, the disqualifying condition set forth in AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is not established. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 4.c relates to Applicant\u2019s eight hours spent in the \nstabilization facility after he drank too much, made suicidal gestures and comments, and \nneeded to sober up. He credibly testified that he believed the correct answer to the \nquestion in Section 24 of the e-QIP (\u201cHave you EVER received counseling or treatment \nas a result of your use of alcohol in addition to what you have already listed on this form?\u201d) \nwas \u201cNo.\u201d He wrote in his Answer, I \u201cwas not aware that what was done was considered \ntreatment.\u201d Applicant credibly testified that he thought his answer to the question was \nhonest. He believed he was there to sleep off his intoxication in a safe environment and \nto go home, which is in fact what happened. Likely the staff also made an assessment \nthat Applicant was not a danger to himself and had no reason to hold him longer than \nthey did. Applicant\u2019s rationale for his negative response to this question is sufficiently \ncredible and reasonable to negate the Government\u2019s inference that the omission was \ndeliberate, arising solely from the omission of facts about his overnight stay at the \nstabilization center. As to SOR \u00b6 4.c, the disqualifying condition set forth in AG \u00b616(a) is \nnot established. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 4.d relates to Applicant\u2019s comments during his March 21, \n2019 security interview on the subject of his experience at the stabilization center. \nSpecifically, the allegation asserts that he failed to tell the investigator that he went to the \nstabilization center \u201cin large part due to [his] suicidal ideations and self-inflicted cuts on \nhis forearms.\u201d Applicant responded in the Answer that he did not deliberately omit this \ninformation, he just was not aware that he had to tell the investigator about it. In fact, the \nreport of the interview states that he volunteered information about a hospitalization for a \nmental health condition. He described the circumstances of what happened before he \nwent to the stabilization center. He explained that his decision to go there was voluntary, \nthat he was only there for eight hours, and that he left after he woke up without objection \nfrom the staff. As noted, Department Counsel acknowledged that the omission of certain \nfacts regarding suicidal ideations and cuts on his forearm did not rise to the level of \nmaterial omissions in the context of the rest of Applicant\u2019s very detailed description of the \nevents. I find that the evidence does not support an allegation that Applicant omitted \nimportant facts in order to mislead the Government. To the contrary, he disclosed \ninformation that he did not believe he had to provide in response to the e-QIP question in \nSection 24, as discussed above. He was trying to be more forthcoming than he initially \nthought was required. As to SOR \u00b6 4.d, the disqualifying condition set forth in AG \u00b616(b) \nis not established. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 4.b regarding his intentional omission \nof delinquent debts in response to the question in Section 26 of his e-QIP. He was badly \nadvised by older co-workers that he need not provide that kind of information on his \napplication. He now realizes that was a mistake. He also realized his mistake at the time \nof his initial security interview, and he volunteered information about his large medical \ndebt that was in collection and his tax debts. He now understands the importance of \ndisclosing everything to the Government in his application. Applicant\u2019s admission to this \nallegation establishes the disqualifying condition set forth in AG \u00b6 16(a). \nThe SOR also cross-alleges under Guideline E all of the Guideline F allegations \nand the Guideline G allegations. Even if taken together, the allegations do not rise to the \nlevel of supporting an adverse whole-person assessment. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not established. \nAlso, these allegations are specifically covered under other guidelines, which renders AG \n\u00b6 16(d) inapplicable. These allegations do not establish separate security concerns \ncognizable under Guideline E, as Department Counsel conceded. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s sole admitted falsification about his delinquent debts \n(SOR \u00b6 4.b): \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nBoth mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant volunteered, at his March 21, 2019 \nsecurity interview, the information he omitted in his February 11, 2019 e-QIP about his \nlarge medical collection debt and two tax debts. This voluntary disclosure constitutes a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the omission before being confronted with the facts. \nAlso, the behavior is so infrequent, and it happened under such unique circumstances of \nApplicant receiving bad advice from more senior employees in a new work environment, \nthat it is unlikely to recur. Applicant now understands how important it is to make full \ndisclosures in security clearance applications and is committed to never repeat this \nbehavior again. The omission does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Paragraph 4 is found in favor of Applicant. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Further comment is warranted. Applicant \nexperienced a difficult time when his wife left him and he was abusing alcohol. He has \nlearned from that experience many years ago and has made significant changes to \nremove toxicity in his life, including alcohol and toxic individuals, and to refocus his life on \nhis child, his job where he has been rewarded with a promotion, and a healthy lifestyle. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without any questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a through 4.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant did not timely file his federal (SOR 1.a) and state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2020; and that, for the 2012 and 2013 tax years, he incurred a debt for unpaid state taxes totaling $21,229, of which he still owed $12,847 (SOR 1.c). The SOR also alleged that Applicant owed a total of $4,504 for six unpaid medical bills (SOR 1.d \u2013 1.i); and that he owed another $7,378 for two past-due or delinquent credit accounts (SOR 1.j and 1.k).

The allegation that \nhe intended to falsify his most recent security clearance application was not established. \nHis request for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 11, 2019, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for a security clearance required \nfor his employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not affirmatively \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. On October 12, 2021, DCSA CAF issued to \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under \nthe adjudicative guideline for financial considerations (Guideline F). \nThe DCSA CAF issued the SOR pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security Executive \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and asked for a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on October 25, 2022, and I scheduled a hearing to be held on \nDecember 8, 2022, via video teleconferencing. The parties appeared as scheduled, and \nI received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 16, 2022. \nApplicant testified in his own behalf and submitted documentary evidence \nidentified as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A - H. I held the record open after the hearing to \nreceive from Applicant additional relevant information. He subsequently submitted 16 \npages of state and federal tax documents identified collectively as AX I. Department \nCounsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 6, as well as a copy of an exhibit list, \nwhich is included as Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1. No objections to admissibility were raised by \neither party and all proffered exhibits were admitted. The record closed on January 3, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant did not timely file his federal \n(SOR 1.a) and state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2020; and \nthat, for the 2012 and 2013 tax years, he incurred a debt for unpaid state taxes totaling \n$21,229, of which he still owed $12,847 (SOR 1.c). The SOR also alleged that Applicant \nowed a total of $4,504 for six unpaid medical bills (SOR 1.d \u2013 1.i); and that he owed \nanother $7,378 for two past-due or delinquent credit accounts (SOR 1.j and 1.k). \nIn response, Applicant admitted each allegation except SOR 1.d. Each response \nwas accompanied by explanatory remarks, and he included documents in support \nthereof. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make \nthe following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked \nsince February 2018. From August 2009 until February 2018, he worked for another \ndefense contractor. He first received a security clearance in 2009. (GX 1) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBetween December 2009 and November 2014, his work for his prior employer was \ndone almost entirely overseas. Except for two months of paid vacation in the United \nStates each year, all his income was earned abroad. When he returned to the United \nStates in 2014, his income fell by about half, causing him financial problems that coincided \nwith other unforeseen financial demands. To make up for lost income, he started \naccepting temporary duty (TDY) assignments at various military customer facilities \naround the nation. Since starting work with his current employer he has continued working \non TDY, during which he receives additional money for meals and incidentals, and is \nreimbursed for other work-related expenses. To the extent he was able to reduce out-of-\npocket expenditures, he was able to save some of his per diem allowance. (GX 1; GX 3; \nTr. 32 \u2013 36, 50 \u2013 53) \nBetween 2012 and 2016, Applicant was married and divorced twice. Before his \nfirst marriage, he had a son, now age 18, for whom he paid child support until 2010, when \nhe was given sole custody of the child. He still supports his son with housing and ad hoc \nexpenses; however, his son recently found employment with a large corporation that \nshould make him financially independent of his father. (GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 34 \u2013 37, 70 \u2013 72) \nAs alleged, Applicant did not file his federal or state income tax returns for the 2015 \nthrough 2020 tax years. He also incurred a debt for unpaid state taxes. Applicant does \nnot excuse his failure to file his returns as required, but he cited factors beyond his control \nthat contributed to his initial failure to file in 2015. As noted, above, all of his income \nbetween 2009 and 2014 was earned abroad. As a result, he received certain exemptions \nfrom tax on his income. In 2012, he started using a tax preparation firm to prepare his \ntaxes. In addition to filing complexities associated with income earned abroad, Applicant \nwas working in a location that made it difficult for him to personally attend to his taxes. He \nclaims that the tax firm advised him he did not have to file any state returns because he \nhad lived and worked abroad for three consecutive years. After he returned from \noverseas, he learned this was not true and that he had incurred the state tax debt alleged \nat SOR 1.c. (Answer; GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 50 \u2013 53, 73) \nApplicant\u2019s return from abroad also coincided with his new and unexpected role as \na single father. His son had been living since birth with the boy\u2019s mother; however, for \nreasons not clear from this record, Applicant was given sole custody in about 2010. Also, \nafter Applicant stopped working abroad, his income fell from about $140,000 overseas to \nabout $50,000 annually. Further compounding his financial problems was his employer\u2019s \ndecision to include his per diem payments as reportable income. This increased his \nannual adjusted gross income and, accordingly, his federal and state income tax \nobligations. (Answer; Tr. 37 \u2013 38, 40) \nApplicant first failed to file his tax returns in 2016 for the 2015 tax year because he \nknew he would not have enough money to pay his tax bill. Thereafter, owing to a suddenly \nmore complicated personal life, a lower level of income, and his own inability to properly \nfile his returns, Applicant procrastinated in filing his tax returns for subsequent years and \nhis unfiled tax returns \u201csnowballed\u201d on him. Among other factors contributing to his failure \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto file his returns after 2015 were his frequent work away from home; back surgery in \nearly 2017 for an injury he suffered in 2016 while helping a neighbor clear a fallen tree \nafter Hurricane Matthew; and another injury suffered in a car accident during one of his \nTDY assignments in 2018. (Answer; GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 38 \u2013 40) \nIn late 2019, around the same time Applicant submitted his most recent e-QIP, he \nengaged a different tax specialist to resolve his late filings. That process was then delayed \nseveral months in 2020 due to the COVID epidemic. Available information shows that all \nof his federal and state income tax returns were filed between February 2022 and \nNovember 2022. Once his returns were filed, it was determined he still owed $12,847 in \nfederal income taxes. Part of the filing process included establishment of a repayment \nplan with the IRS through which Applicant has resolved his federal income tax debt. \n(Answer; GX 1; GX 3; GX 4; AX E; AX I; Tr. 45 \u2013 51, 53 \u2013 60) \nAt the state level, a levy against Applicant\u2019s wages was obtained to resolve a \n$21,229 tax debt for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. That debt resulted from the inaccurate \nadvice he received from the first income tax specialist he used while working overseas. \nAs of the SOR, that debt had been reduced to $12,847; as of his response thereto, it was \n$8,192; and when he appeared at his hearing it had just been paid off. (Answer; GX 1; \nGX 3; AX F; Tr. 37) \nApplicant also accrued several past-due or delinquent medical bills due to his 2017 \nsurgery and his 2018 car accident. He presented information that shows he paid or \notherwise resolved the debts at SOR 1.e \u2013 1.i. There is no information in the record about \nthe $2,976 medical debt at SOR 1.d other than its absence from the most recent credit \nreport in the record, dated March 1, 2022. The SOR 1.d creditor is the same as SOR 1.f \nand 1.g, and Applicant testified the SOR 1.d debt likely was satisfied through his \nsettlement of his other medical debts. However, he was unable to definitively establish \nthat assertion. (Answer; AX A \u2013 C; Tr. 60 \u2013 63) \nTwo other debts alleged at SOR 1.j and 1.k have been resolved. Those commercial \ndebts became delinquent as a result of the reductions in his income from the state tax \ngarnishment and his lower wages working in the United States. He settled the SOR 1.j \ndebt for about one-fourth of the original debt. The creditor for the $4,232 SOR 1.k debt \ncancelled that debt and issued Applicant an IRS Form 1099-C, requiring him to declare \n$3,641 as income on his 2020 federal income tax return. His 2020 federal income tax \nreturn shows that he declared that amount as required. (Answer; GX 6; Tr. 63 \u2013 66) \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are sound. He has incurred no new unpaid debts and \nlives within his means. Now that his state tax debt is resolved, he has about $583 more \nin each paycheck. As a result, he has a positive net cash flow of at least $1,000 each \nmonth, and will be able to avoid going into debt when unexpected expenses arise. He \nintends to continue using his current tax specialist to prepare and file his federal and state \nincome taxes each year. He also provided letters of recommendation and copies of his \njob performance appraisals and awards. Collectively, that information shows that he is a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhardworking, reliable, and professional employee, who is also a good father trying to meet \nhis family and community obligations to the best of his ability. (Answer; AX G. AX H; Tr. \n34) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(Egan at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n5 \n\n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past-due or delinquent \ndebts. Available information also shows that he did not file his federal and state income \ntax returns as required for the 2015 through 2020 tax years, and that he incurred a \nsignificant debt for unpaid state taxes as a result. This information reasonably raises a \nsecurity concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n6 \n\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file \nor pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose under unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nApplicant weathered a significant decrease in income when his work abroad ended. He \nalso incurred a significant state tax debt because of inaccurate advice from his previous \ntax specialist. He has increased monthly cashflow now that his wages are no longer being \ngarnished, and even while he was subject to that garnishment, he negotiated settlements \nof his past-due medical and commercial debts. As to his income tax returns, he has now \nfiled all his past-due returns; he has an effective tax specialist that he will use in all of his \nfuture filings; and he promptly paid the federal taxes due as determined in his late-filed \nreturns. \nAs to whether Applicant acted in good faith to repay his creditors, or whether he \nacted responsibly in the face of unforeseen circumstances, the result is mixed. On the \none hand, his state tax debt was resolved through an involuntary wage garnishment, and \nhe did not start the process of filing his past-due returns until 2019, despite being aware \nof those discrepancies for at least four years. Yet he began the process of resolving his \ntaxes and paying his other debts well before the SOR was issued. Also, circumstances \nbeyond his control (medical problems, multiple extended periods of TDY, and the COVID \npandemic) slowed his ability to completely resolve his financial and tax issues until 2022. \nNonetheless, those issues were largely resolved before this hearing, and available \ninformation shows that similar financial and tax problems are unlikely to recur. On \nbalance, I conclude the record shows that the security concerns under this guideline are \nmitigated. \nI also have considered the potential application of the whole-person factors at \u00b6 \n2(d). I note that his personal and financial circumstances have improved. He has a solid \nreputation for reliability and trustworthiness in the workplace and is regarded by those \nwho know him as a responsible and committed single father. Available information shows \nthat Applicant has acted responsibly in resolving his delinquent debts and improving his \nfinances overall. The record evidence as a whole supports a fair and commonsense \ndecision in favor of Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \nMatthew E. Malone \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 22, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer with the exception of \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, which he denied. He is 30 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was \nsingle, he did not have any children, and he rented an apartment with a roommate since \napproximately February 2021. (Answer; Tr. at 18-19, 38, 46; GE 1-2) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2011. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \npsychology in May 2015. He attended classes towards a master\u2019s degree from August \n2016 to March 2017, but he had not yet earned that degree.

He has never held a security \nclearance. (Tr. at 5, 7-8, 18-19, 43, 46; GE 1-2) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used and purchased marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from approximately September 2013 to at least May 2021, and that he had not \ncommitted to discontinue his marijuana use clearly and convincingly.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e) \nApplicant first used marijuana in September 2013. He was 20 years old and in \ncollege. He spent about $40 every two to three weeks to purchase marijuana from college \nfriends, and he used it with those friends approximately weekly. He stopped using \nmarijuana as he approached his graduation date, because he knew he would be returning \nto live with his parents and they would not permit marijuana use in their home. He used \nmarijuana during two periods when he did not live with his parents, from August 2016 to \nMarch 2017 and January 2018 until August 2020. (Tr. at 21-31, 35-39, 49-50, 61-62; GE \n1-2) \nSometime in 2019, Applicant obtained a medical marijuana card. He obtained a \nmedical marijuana card after he read that marijuana could help treat the neurological \ndisorder he has had since birth, and for which he was officially diagnosed at around age \n11. He sought to supplement with marijuana the medication his doctor prescribed him for \nhis disorder. He consulted with his neurologist, and the neurologist advised him that \nmarijuana could not hurt to try. He also enjoyed using marijuana recreationally.

He used marijuana while he resided with them, from approximately \nAugust 2020 to February 2021. In his June 2021 response to interrogatories, he stated \nthat he last purchased marijuana in March 2021, from a marijuana dispensary. He also \nstated in his response to interrogatories that he last used marijuana in May 2021, and \nthat his frequency of marijuana use up to that point was approximately once every two to \nthree weeks.

(Tr. at 21-31, 35-39, 49-59, 62-66, \n68, 71; GE 1-2) \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana use on his SCA. In response to a question in \nsection 23 that inquired whether he intended to use it in the future, Applicant stated: \nHonestly, this is a maybe. If my employment is contingent on not using \nmedical marijuana, then I will fully commit to not using it. However, due to \nits medicinal nature and the fact that I have a qualifying condition, if my \nemployment is not contingent on remaining THC free, then I would be \ninclined to resume use. \n(GE 1) \nApplicant indicated, during his December 2020 interview with a background \ninvestigator, that he would not use marijuana if it negatively affected his chances for \nemployment or a security clearance. He also indicated that if there were no issue with his \nmedical marijuana use, he would continue to use marijuana because he believed it helped \ntreat his neurological disorder. He testified that at the time he made the above-quoted \nstatement on his SCA, \u201cmy thinking was if I don\u2019t have to stop, I wouldn\u2019t like to because \nI don\u2019t personally see any -- I mean, it\u2019s never affected my work . . ..\u201d He testified, \u201c. . .

He testified that he was \nunaware that illegal drug use was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. (Tr. at \n20-21, 31, 39, 50-61, 70; GE 1-2) \nApplicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms twice between April 2018 and June \n2020. He purchased it from friends on both occasions.

He has two friends who also use marijuana infrequently, \nsometimes in his presence. As of the date of the hearing and since March 2022, he has \nfound himself in situations where marijuana was being used and where he was offered \nmarijuana, and he instead had a beer or entertained himself another way. He stated that \nhe still possessed a dried flower containing marijuana and marijuana-related \nparaphernalia. In September 2022, he signed a statement of intent not to abuse any drugs \nin the future.

(Tr. at 47-50, 61-62, 66-72; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana between approximately 2013 and 2022. \nHe stated in his SCA and during his background interview that he would continue to use \nmarijuana, due to his disorder, if his employment were not contingent on abstaining from \nillegal drug use. He continued to use marijuana after completed his SCA, after he \nresponded to interrogatories, and after he received the SOR. He used and purchased \nhallucinogenic mushrooms twice between April 2018 and June 2020, and he used \necstasy once in April 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s single use of ecstasy occurred in 2018, nearly five years ago. AG \u00b6 \n26(a) applies to his ecstasy use and I find SOR \u00b6 1.e in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, his \nlast use and purchase of hallucinogenic mushrooms in 2020 was less than three years \nago. His last purchase of marijuana was less than two years ago, and less than a year \nhas passed since he last used marijuana. Although he signed a statement of intent in \nSeptember 2022 not to abuse any drugs in the future, he continued to socialize with \nindividuals who use marijuana. He possessed a product containing marijuana and \nmarijuana-related paraphernalia as of the date of the hearing. His history of marijuana \ninvolvement since 2013, coupled with his use of marijuana after he submitted to a pre-\nemployment drug test by his employer through March 2022, continue to raise doubts \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.

I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns involving drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:   \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was involuntarily admitted to the hospital\u2019s psychiatric unit. He was \ndiagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar mood disorder, and sleep deprivation. \nAfter he was stabilized with medication, Applicant was released to outpatient care. In \nNovember 2018, he began seeing a psychiatric nurse practitioner (PNP). In response to \nApplicant\u2019s complaints about the side effects of the treatment regimen established \nduring his hospitalization, the PNP started Applicant on a new treatment plan with \ndifferent medications. Over the next year, the PNP changed and adjusted Applicant\u2019s \nmedications to address the negative side effects of the medications. In February 2019, \nApplicant decided that he felt better and stopped taking the medications which \ncontinued to have negative side effects. (Tr.2 at 16-18; GE 2-3) \nLater that month, Applicant\u2019s symptoms returned. He could not sleep. He was \nagitated. He was responding to internal stimuli and hearing noises. Applicant\u2019s behavior \ncaused his wife to call the police, who again transported him to a local emergency \ndepartment. He was involuntarily admitted to the psychiatric ward for six days. After his \ndischarge, he resumed treatment with his PNP. (GE 2-3) \nApplicant followed his treatment plan for five months. He stopped taking his \nmedications again in July 2019, while on a trip to his home country. His symptoms \nreturned. After he returned to the United States, his symptoms became acute, and he \nwas involuntarily hospitalized again in August 2019. He was diagnosed with \nschizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and catatonia. He was again released to the \noutpatient care of the PNP until 2020, when Applicant transferred his care to a different \nprovider, a certified registered nurse practitioner in psychiatric mental health \n(CRNP/PMH). (Tr.2 at 18-20; GE 2-3) \nFrom September 2019 to November 2020, Applicant remained compliant with his \ntreatment plan with the CRNP/PMH. However, in November 2020, while on the \nmedications, Applicant began experiencing symptoms. His wife took him to the hospital \nfor immediate treatment but was turned away because of Covid-19 protocols in place at \nthe hospital and because his symptoms were not acute. Upon returning home, \nApplicant\u2019s wife contacted the CRNP/PMH, who adjusted Applicant\u2019s medication. \nDespite the adjustments, Applicant continued to experience symptoms, becoming more \ndisoriented and erratic. In December 2020, a disoriented Applicant wandered out of his \nhome. His wife filed a missing person report with the police, who found Applicant and \ntransported him to the hospital where he was involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care. \nThe CRNP/PMH adjusted Applicant\u2019s medication in response to the hospitalization. \n(Tr.2 at 33-34; GE 2) \nApplicant reported each hospitalization to his facility security officer. After each \nhospitalization, he was able to return to work without incident.

There is nothing in the record to \nsuggest that Applicant has engaged in any behavior in the workplace that raised \nquestions with his employers about his judgement or reliability. (Tr. 2 at 23) \nIn June 2020, the DOD CAF referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation \nfrom a licensed psychologist. The psychologist conducted the evaluation in March 2021, \nwhich consisted of a clinical interview and a personality assessment inventory. The \npsychologist also reviewed the September 2019 security clearance application, \ninterviews Applicant gave to background investigators in 2019 and 2020, as well as \nmedical records from the October 2018, August 2019, and February 2019 \nhospitalizations. The hospitalization records are not in the record. (GE 3) \nThe psychologist concluded: \nLike many people when first diagnosed with a serious mental health \ncondition, [Applicant] has been given a number of psychiatric labels and \nbeen tried on a range of medications in an effort to find the right balance \nbetween symptom reduction and side effects. Also, like those coming to \nterms with and learning about a chronic mental health condition, \n[Applicant] stopped medications completely two times resulting in a [sic] \nreturn of symptoms and additional hospitalization. This is common for \npeople in the early years of a serious mental health diagnosis as they \nlearn the diagnoses are real and treatment is needed. He has now \ndeveloped the opinion that he needs the medications and has resolved to \nadhere to his provider\u2019s recommendation. However, he complains about \nmany immediate, and potentially long term, side effects of his multiple \nmedications. These side effects are not inconsequential. The medications \nseem to have muted his affect, slowed his processing speed, and \nnegatively impacted his frontal lobe functioning (i.e., attention control and \nproblem solving.) All these are cognitive skills needed to successfully \nsafeguard information (and to perform his other job duties.). His \nmedication also places him in a state of general interpersonal blankness \nand contextual stupor so he will certainly appear odd to other people. This \ncould impact his ability to communicate with others, his judgments when \nhe makes an error or need help, and his vulnerability to those who might \ntry to exploit him. (GE 3) \nThe evaluating psychologist diagnosed Applicant with unspecified schizophrenia \nspectrum disorder, multiple episodes, in partial remission and unspecified anxiety \ndisorder. The psychologist noted that Applicant\u2019s condition will require ongoing, \nconsistent lifelong treatment to maintain his stability. He acknowledges that the \nApplicant is stable on his current pharmaceutical regimen, but that this could change \nbased on changes in Applicant\u2019s physiology, if he stops taking his medication, or \nexperiences a significant increase in stress. These changes, the psychologist explained, \ncould lead to the return of Applicant\u2019s symptoms, including perceptual disturbances or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndisordered thinking. The psychologist described Applicant\u2019s prognosis as \u201cfair at best.\u201d \n(GE 3) \nUltimately the psychologist concluded that \u201cthere is a considerable risk \n[Applicant\u2019s] symptoms will resurface at some point in the future. Thus, his condition \ncould negatively impact his judgment and reliability thereby diminishing his capacity to \nsafeguard national security information.\u201d (GE 3) \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s affect was flat. He spoke slowly and quietly but was \nable to clearly communicate his personal history. He also discussed the issues he has \nexperienced with his mental health since 2018. When he stopped taking his medication \nin February 2019 and July 2019, he really did not understand that his condition was \nsomething that would require lifelong treatment and that he could not stop taking the \nmedication when he felt better. He stated he began to understand the nature of his \nillness and lifetime treatment needs after his third hospitalization. He also explained that \nfinding the right balance of medication was a process, requiring frequent medical visits \nand adjustment of medications. The medical notes in the record show that Applicant \nroutinely saw his treating CRNP/PMH between February 2020 and June 2021, when he \nresponded to DOHA interrogatories. The notes show him reporting to his medical \nprovider when he felt his medications were not working properly or causing him \nintolerable side effects. (Tr. 2 at 18; GE 2) \nApplicant has complied with his treatment plans, without interruption since \nSeptember 2019. He believes his current treatment plan is working well. Since his last \nmajor medication adjustment after his December 2020 hospitalization, he has not \nexperienced any negative side effects or the return of his symptoms. Since November \n2021, he has paired his pharmaceutical treatment with therapy with a licensed certified \nsocial worker \u2013 clinical (LCSW-C) through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Applicant \nhas quarterly visits with each of his providers. Both his current CRNP/PMH and \ntherapist consider him stable and able to work without limitation or restriction. (Tr.2 at \n21, 25-27; AE A-B) \nApplicant\u2019s wife also testified at the hearing. She explained her learning curve \nassociated with Applicant\u2019s illness. Between 2018 and 2020, she explained that the \nmedicines left Applicant unable to function. On his current treatment plan, Applicant has \nnot complained of any side effects. She is the one who is first to notice when he is \ndeteriorating, which usually begins with sleep deprivation, and seeks medical \nintervention on his behalf. She no longer waits until the circumstances require \nemergency intervention, contacting his medical providers directly when he complains of \nside effects. She also discussed her observations of Applicant\u2019s adjustments to his \ndiagnosis and treatment. Initially, she had to dispense Applicant\u2019s medications to him to \nensure that he took them. While she still portions the medication into a pill box, he takes \nhis medication on his own without prompting or supervision from her. He often reminds \nher to refill the pill box. Applicant has also progressed to the point where she no longer \nmust attend his medical appointments with him. For the last three years, he has been \nable to go to his medical appointments on his own.

(Tr.2 at 22, 30-39) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nAnalysis \nAn applicant\u2019s mental health becomes a concern when \u201c[c]ertain emotional, \nmental, and personality conditions can impair judgement, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nA formal diagnosis is not required for there to be a concern under this guideline.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n27) The SOR alleges that Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized four times between \nOctober 2018 and December 2020 for episodes of erratic behavior resulting in a \ndiagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, and that Applicant stopped taking his prescribed \nmedicines on two occasions in February and July 2019. The SOR also alleged that a \npsychologist retained to perform an evaluation indicated that Applicant has a condition \nthat could negatively impact his judgment and ability to protect classified information.  \nApplicant admits the allegations.  \nThe following psychological conditions disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 28(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 28(c) voluntary and involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and, \nAG \u00b6 28(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a \ndiagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or untrustworthiness, including, but not limited to, \nfailure to take prescribed medication or failure to attend required \ncounseling sessions. \nApplicant\u2019s medical condition will require lifelong monitoring and treatment. When \nhe was first diagnosed, he did not fully understand or appreciate the nature of his illness \nor how compliance with his treatment plan is necessary to remain stable. According to \nthe evaluating psychologist, Applicant\u2019s response and learning curve associated with his \ndiagnosis is common, but he now understands his condition and the ongoing nature of \nits treatment. He has taken ownership of managing his appointments with his providers \nand takes his medication without prompting or supervision from his wife. He has been \ncompliant with his treatment plans since September 2019. \nAlso common, according to the psychologist\u2019s report, is the trial-and-error nature \nof finding the right balance of medications to control Applicant\u2019s symptoms without \nintolerable side effects. Working consistently with his CRNP/PMH, Applicant has found \nthat balance. His symptoms have been in remission since at least January 2021, and he \nis not currently experiencing any negative side effects. It is important to note, as the \npsychologist warned, that this balance is not permanent. Physiological and \nenvironmental changes could decrease the effectiveness of the treatment protocol, \nresulting in the recurrence of symptoms and the possibility of future hospitalizations. \nHowever, Applicant demonstrated that he and his wife are diligent in monitoring his \nbehavior for the return of symptoms and that they will seek medical intervention when it \nis needed. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe psychologist described Applicant\u2019s condition as being in remission and his \nprognosis as \u201cfair at best.\u201d The prognosis is conservative and reasonable given the \nnature of Applicant\u2019s illness and the potential for the recurrence of symptoms even \nwhen he is compliant with this treatment plan. The following psychological conditions \nmitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 29(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; and \nAG \u00b6 29(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government, \nthat an individual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and \nhas a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation. \nWhole Person Assessment \nBased on the information in the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nongoing security worthiness. Applicant\u2019s diagnosis will require lifetime attention. He is \ndoing all he can to remain stable and symptom free. While there is no guarantee he will \nremain so, he and his wife are vigilant in monitoring Applicant\u2019s health, and they take \naction to address his needs as they arise. His treatment plan and symptoms are also \nroutinely monitored by therapist and his CRNP/MHP, both of whom believe Applicant is \nstable and able to work without restriction. \nFurthermore, during his past periods of acute illness, Applicant has not displayed \nviolent tendencies. He does not appear to be a danger to his family or others. He has \nnot engaged in any criminal conduct or conduct that raises concern about his inability to \ncontrol his impulses in a manner that reflects negatively on his current security \nworthiness. He has not had any work-related incidents because of his condition and has \nproperly managed his responsibilities as a clearance holder when he unable to perform \nhis duties. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Psychological Conditions \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Thomas, Esq. \n05/03/2023 \nDecision \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant satisfied two of the three alleged financial delinquencies and is no longer \nbehind on bill payments for the third debt. He now drinks in moderation, and \napproximately four years have passed since his last alcohol-related episode. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations and \nalcohol consumption security concerns. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 24, 2022, Department of Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant. The SOR alleged facts raising security concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations, and Guideline G, alcohol consumption, explaining why it was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national security to grant security clearance \neligibility. The DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn November 9, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations and \nrequested a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on March 9, 2023. On \nMarch 10, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of video \nteleconference hearing, scheduling the hearing on March 14, 2023. Applicant, through \ncounsel, waived his right to 15 days\u2019 notice of hearing. The hearing was held as \nscheduled. I considered Applicant\u2019s testimony, together with 13 Government Exhibits \n(GE), marked and incorporated into the record as GE 1 through GE 13, and 15 Applicant \nexhibits (AE), marked and incorporated into the record as AE A through AE O. \nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I extended the record through March 29, 2023, to afford \nhim the opportunity to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted \none additional exhibit, marked and incorporated into the record as AE P. Both parties \nfiled post-hearing memoranda on March 13, 2023. I have incorporated them both into the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit I. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 23, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 32-year-old married man with four stepchildren. After graduating \nfrom high school in 2009, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he served through 2018. \n(Tr. 19) He was honorably discharged. (Tr. 19; AE N) Since 2018, he has been working \nin the field of communications technology. (GE 1 at 13; Tr. 44-45) \nIn 2016, Applicant cosigned an apartment lease with a friend and her family. He \ndid so because they were unable to qualify for a lease on their own. (Tr. 24) Neither \nApplicant\u2019s friend nor her husband was working at the time. Applicant agreed to help them \nmake their rental payments. The agreement worked for a month before his friends \nstopped making their share of the payments. (Tr. 24) Applicant considered ending the \nlease early and giving the landlord two months\u2019 rent payments, required under the terms \nof the lease for early termination. However, he decided to stay with the lease through the \nend of the one-year term because he did not want to \u201cput out\u201d his friends\u2019 children, having \nhimself experienced a bout of homelessness as a child when his parents\u2019 house was \nforeclosed . (Tr. 26; Tr. 38) Subsequently, Applicant continued paying his friends\u2019 rent. \nEach successive month, however, he began incurring $500 of debt that he could not \nafford to pay off. (Tr. 26) By the end of the term of the lease, Applicant\u2019s friends had \nmoved from the apartment. By then, Applicant\u2019s bills had become delinquent. (Tr. 26-28) \nSubparagraph 1.a of the SOR is a deficiency remaining from a repossessed \nvehicle, totaling approximately $25,000. (Answer at 1) In November 2022, Applicant \nentered into a payment arrangement with the creditor, in which he agreed to pay $200 \nper month to satisfy the debt. (AE A) He has been in compliance with the agreement since \nthen. (AEs A, P; Tr. 42) In February 2023, Applicant filed his federal and state income tax \nreturns with the help of an accounting firm. (AE C) Per a firm representative, Applicant \nwill receive federal and state refunds totaling $6,184. (AE C) Once Applicant receives \nthese refunds, he intends to apply the money to the automobile deficiency. (Tr. 27) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b of the SOR, totaling $302, is a delinquent balance remaining on \nan insurance policy after Applicant terminated it. When Applicant switched policies, he \nwas unaware that he still owed a payment. (Answer at 2) Upon becoming aware of the \ncharge in January 2022, Applicant paid the balance. (AE E) \nSubparagraph 1.c of the SOR, totaling $2,163, is a delinquent phone bill. \nApplicant\u2019s roommates incurred about $900 of this debt. (Tr. 28) In November 2022, \nApplicant contacted the creditor and negotiated a reduced payoff balance of $1,406. (AE \nF) In January 2023, he paid the negotiated balance in full. (AE G) \n \n \n \nApplicant earns $70,000 per year. (Tr. 46) He maintains a budget and has $3,900 \nof monthly discretionary income. (Tr. 47) \nIn 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). \n(GE 9) He was convicted and sentenced to 12 months\u2019 probation. (GE 9 at 2) As part of \nthe terms of probation, he had to attend alcohol education classes, participate in \ncommunity service, obtain a substance abuse assessment, and abstain from alcohol for \none year. (Tr. 50; AE J ) Applicant complied with the probation terms as ordered. (AE I) \nA psychologist evaluated him and concluded he did not have an alcohol consumption \nproblem. (AE J) \nIn 2019, after a night of heavy drinking with friends, Applicant blacked out. Six days \nlater, a female friend, with whom he was socializing on the night he blacked out, accused \nhim of shoving her to the ground and choking her. These accusations led to Applicant\u2019s \narrest for assault. Applicant denies this behavior, but does not remember anything from \nthat night. Later, during mediation, the woman agreed to drop the charges if Applicant \ncompleted anger management. Applicant completed anger management classes, as \nrequested, and she dropped the charges. (Tr. 54) The record is inconclusive as to whether \nApplicant assaulted the friend, as alleged. \nApplicant has not drunk alcohol to the point of intoxication since the 2019 episode \nand since October 2021 has abstained from alcohol entirely. (Tr. 33) He does not drink \nalcohol because he believes that alcohol consumption could lead to alcohol abuse, which \ncould potentially jeopardize the safety, welfare, and financial security of his family. (Tr. \n34) \nApplicant is highly respected by his peers. Per a fellow veteran and former \ncoworker, Applicant is an open, honest, and dedicated man who has grown over the \nyears. (AE O) A friend describes him as \u201cone of the best individuals [he has] ever known.\u201d \n(AE O at 2) Per the civilian executive officer for the agency Applicant supports, he has a \nstrong work ethic, a tremendous thirst for knowledge, and is a valued member of the team. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\u2019s financial obligations.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b approximately nine \nmonths before the issuance of the SOR. I resolve this subparagraph in his favor. \nThe debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c stemmed, in part, from financial \ndifficulties that Applicant experienced when a couple with whom he cosigned a lease \nstopped paying their rent, leaving him responsible. Neither person was working when \nApplicant agreed to cosign the lease. Moreover, he was aware that they were having \nproblems obtaining a rental property before they asked him for help. Consequently, it was \nreasonably foreseeable that they were going to have problems making their rental \npayments. Therefore, the financial problems Applicant experienced after they stopped \npaying cannot be construed as having been caused by circumstances beyond his control. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nNevertheless, Applicant has satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c and he \nis in compliance with a payment plan to satisfy the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMoreover, he maintains a budget, and he has ample monthly discretionary income to \ncontinue complying with the payment plan. Consequently, although these financial \nproblems were not remote enough in time to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(a), the \nclear indications that he is paying down the remaining debt are sufficient to trigger the \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d). In sum, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nUnder this guideline, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise \nof questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d Applicant\u2019s 2014 and 2019 alcohol-related \narrests trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, \nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol-use disorder; and \n20(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.\u201d \nApplicant has not had any alcohol-related incidents in almost four years, and he \nhas been abstinent entirely from alcohol consumption for the past 18 months. He stopped \nusing alcohol because he recognizes that alcohol use could lead to alcohol abuse, which \ncould have a deleterious effect on his family, his job, and his health. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude that AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior \nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment,\u201d applies. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUpon considering all of the mitigating and disqualifying conditions in the context of \nthe whole-person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \n6 \n\n_____________________ \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 1, 2023. \nSOR Amendment \nAt the hearing, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR, \npursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive, to conform to the evidence. She amended SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b to strike the word \u201cthumb\u201d and replace it with \u201cpersonal external.\u201d She \namended SOR \u00b6 4.c so that it reads, \u201cYour brother is a citizen of China and resident of \nJapan.\u201d She amended SOR \u00b6 4.d so that it reads \u201cYour mother-in-law is a citizen and \nresident of China.\u201d \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. He is 60 years old. He was born in \nChina, where he graduated from high school in 1980, earned an associate degree in \n1983, and married in 1987. In September 1995, at age 32, he immigrated to the United \nStates and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999. He divorced and remarried in 2006, \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008, divorced in 2011, and remarried in 2012. He \nhas an adult child from his first marriage, who was born in China, became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen, and resides in the United States. He also has a minor child from his current \nmarriage, who was born in the United States and resides with Applicant and his spouse \nin the United States. He has owned his home in the United States since October 2020. \n(Tr. at 25-35, 77, 87-88, 100, 107, 128-132; GE 1-2; AE A, P, Q) \nWhen Applicant was solely a Chinese citizen, he held two Chinese passports that \nwere issued to him in China in 1995 and 1999, and which expired in 1997 and 2009, \nrespectively. When he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008, he was issued a U.S. \npassport that expired in 2018. He was subsequently issued another U.S. passport in \n2018, and it is not scheduled to expire until 2028. In 2017, he obtained a Chinese visa \nthat is not scheduled to expire until 2027, and he uses this visa, along with his U.S. \npassport, when he travels to China, as further discussed below.

Most Chinese cyber operations against U.S. private industry that have \nbeen detected are focused on cleared defense contractors or information technology \nand communications firms whose products and services support government and \nprivate sector networks worldwide. \nMultiple U.S. criminal indictments since 2015 involve Chinese nationals, \nnaturalized U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens from China, and U.S. citizens, \nprocuring and exporting controlled items to China.

Since the imposition of the National Security \nLaw on June 30, 2020, China unilaterally and arbitrarily exercises police and security \npower in Hong Kong. \nIn 2019, China\u2019s response to terrorism remained difficult to distinguish from the \ngovernment\u2019s suppression of peaceful activities that authorities deemed separatist or \nsubversive in nature. Details about alleged terrorism-related incidents inside China were \ndifficulty to verify due to a lack of transparency and information from Chinese \nauthorities. As in 2018, Chinese officials continued to claim that no violent terrorist \nincidents have occurred in the country since 2016, owing to the government\u2019s \u201cnew \ncounter-extremism policies,\u201d to justify Beijing\u2019s repressive campaign in Xinjiang. \nThe U.S. Department of State in April 2022 rated China as Level 3: Reconsider \nTravel to China and Hong Kong, due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws and COVID-\n19 related restrictions, and it ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. Government \nemployees and all family members from the Consulate General Shanghai consular \ndistrict, due to a surge in COVID-19 cases and the impact of restrictions related to \nChina\u2019s response.  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual behavior: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nIn violation of company policy, Applicant inserted a personal USB hard disk \ncontaining extensive adult pornography into his work-issued computer in 2015, and his \nthen-employer consequently received an alarm that child pornography had been \naccessed.

I considered \nrelevant AG \u00b6 14(b), \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.\u201d This was an isolated \nincident that occurred nearly eight years ago. Applicant was not arrested or charged \nwith any offense. He was remorseful and learned his lesson not to use a personal \ndevice on his company computer and to follow company policies. \u00b6 14(b) is established. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern for use of information technology: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \nIn violation of company policy, Applicant inserted a personal USB hard disk \ncontaining extensive adult pornography into his work-issued computer in 2015, and his \nthen-employer consequently received an alarm that child pornography had been \naccessed. AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(e) and 40(f) apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 and considered \nrelevant AG \u00b6 41(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d For the \nsame reasons set forth above in my Guideline D analysis, I find that AG \u00b6 41(a) is \nestablished. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nIn violation of company policy, Applicant inserted a personal USB hard disk \ncontaining extensive adult pornography into his work-issued computer in 2015, and his \nthen-employer consequently received an alarm that child pornography had been \naccessed. Although Applicant denied ever viewing child pornography, the letter from the \nstate\u2019s attorney reflects that forensic analysis of the items seized from his home \nrevealed images of evidentiary value. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nFor the same reasons set forth above in my Guideline D and Guideline M \nanalyses, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are established. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern for foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. \nApplicant\u2019s brother, although a Chinese citizen, resides in Japan. He has lived \nwith his spouse in Japan since 2010, and he works as a cook in a restaurant and his \nspouse works in a hotel. I find that none of the relevant disqualifying conditions under \u00b6 \n7 apply to Applicant\u2019s brother and I find SOR \u00b6 4.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sisters, and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nChina. He and his spouse maintain close contact with them. China remains the top \nthreat to U.S. technological competitiveness as its government targets key sectors and \nproprietary commercial and military technology from the United States and allied \ncompanies and institutions. China\u2019s intelligence services, as well as private companies \nand other entities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties \nto China who can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using \nremovable media devices or email. Most Chinese cyber operations against U.S. private \nindustry that have been detected are focused on cleared defense contractors or \ninformation technology and communications firms whose products and services support \ngovernment and private sector networks worldwide. Significant human rights issues \npersist in China. Applicant\u2019s family in China create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), \nand 7(e) apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest; and \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sisters, and mother-in-law are Chinese citizens residing in \nChina. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e). Applicant and his spouse maintain close \ncontact with their family in China. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in 1995. He earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in the United States in 1999, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008, his \nspouse became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2020, and their child was born in the \nUnited States. He has owned his home in the United States since 2020, and his assets \nin the United States total approximately $1,140,000. These are all factors that weigh in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. However, his ties to his family in China are also strong. As such, \nApplicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that he would resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, M, E, and B in my whole-person analysis. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the sexual behavior, use of information \ntechnology, and personal conduct security concerns, but he did not mitigate the foreign \ninfluence security concerns \nApplicant requested in his Answer for a waiver, in accordance with SEAD 4 \nAppendix C. The adjudicative guidelines authorize a waiver \u201cdespite the presence of \nsubstantial issue information that would normally preclude eligibility,\u201d with the provision \nthat a waiver may be approved \u201conly when the benefit of initial or continued eligibility \nclearly outweighs any security concerns,\u201d and that a waiver \u201cmay also require conditions \nfor eligibility.\u201d I have concluded a waiver in this case is not warranted. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline B: \nSubparagraphs 4.a - 4.b: \nSubparagraph 4.c: \nSubparagraph 4.d: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant. \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h.). His admissions are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior geospatial subject matter expert with his current employer since about October 2017. He was a self-employed consultant from January 2016 until October 2017, and from December 2001 until December 2015, he was the president and chief executive officer of his own company, a Chapter S Corporation. He was previously a program manager with another federal contractor from December 1997 until December 2001. A 1978 high school graduate, he earned approximately 165 hours towards a college degree, but he has not earned that degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 1978, and served on active duty until January 1990, when he was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant (E-6). (AE M) He has been granted a variety of security clearances (secret, top secret, and sensitive compartmented information (SCI) since about 1978.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 22, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On January 14, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories requesting federal tax account transcripts for \ncertain years as well as tax account transcripts for four different states. On an unspecified \ndate, he responded to those interrogatories and submitted a substantial number of \ndocuments that came within the request. On August 13, 2021, the DCSA CAF issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn an undated statement, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was \nprepared to proceed on December 29, 2021. Because of health concerns associated with \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic protocols, the case was not assigned to me until \nAugust 17, 2022. A Notice of Microsoft Teams Video Teleconference Hearing was issued \non November 4, 2022. I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 9, 2022. \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 13 and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE L were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \nand three witnesses testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 22, 2022. I \nkept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it with documentation that was \nidentified during the hearing. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely submitted \nadditional documents that were marked and admitted as AE M through AE Q without \nobjection. The record closed on November 29, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all the factual allegations \npertaining to financial considerations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h.). His admissions are \nincorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a senior geospatial subject matter expert with his current employer since about \nOctober 2017. He was a self-employed consultant from January 2016 until October 2017, \nand from December 2001 until December 2015, he was the president and chief executive \nofficer of his own company, a Chapter S Corporation. He was previously a program \nmanager with another federal contractor from December 1997 until December 2001. A \n1978 high school graduate, he earned approximately 165 hours towards a college degree, \nbut he has not earned that degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 1978, and \nserved on active duty until January 1990, when he was honorably discharged as a staff \nsergeant (E-6). (AE M) He has been granted a variety of security clearances (secret, top \nsecret, and sensitive compartmented information (SCI) since about 1978. (GE 1 at 41-\n44) He was married in 1986 and divorced in 1996. He remarried in 1996 and divorced in \n2011. He has four children, born in 1986, 1996, 1998, and 2001. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMilitary Awards and Decorations \nDuring his military service Applicant received the following awards and \ndecorations: the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon (2 awards), the \nArmy Good Conduct Medal (3 awards), the Army Commendation Medal (3 awards), the \nNCO Professional Development Ribbon (2 awards), the Army Achievement Medal (2 \nawards), and the Expert Badge (M-16 Rifle). \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: GE 1 (SF 86, dated June 22, 2018); GE 2 (Incident \nReport, dated January 20, 2021); GE 3 (LexisNexis Judgment and Lien Filings, dated \nJune 25, 2021); GE 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated October 23, 2018); GE & \n(Income Tax Documents Submitted by Applicant, various dates); and GE 8 (Equifax \nCredit Report, dated June 29, 2021). \nIn his June 2018 SF 86, Applicant reported that because of issues related to a \ndivorce, he had failed to either file and/or pay federal or state income taxes for the tax \nyears 2015 and 2016. He claimed that prior to June 2018 he referred those issues to a \nnationally known income tax preparation company to review, and he intended to file the \nreturns by the end of July 2018. (GE 1 at 44-46) However, during an interview with an \ninvestigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on October 23, 2018, \nit was revealed that one particular state had indicated that he owed $158,000 in income \ntaxes for 2015 alone, and that he had not filed his individual state income tax returns for \nthe tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012. Applicant disputed those allegations, claiming that \nhe had filed those returns. The state also told him that he had to file income tax returns \nfor the tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. (GE 6 at 4-5) He acknowledged that the IRS had \nconducted audits in 2009-2010, and finalized the audits in 2012. In fact, because \nApplicant owed unpaid income taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and/or the \nstate, at least two federal tax liens and one state tax lien were filed against him. As of the \ndate the SOR was issued in August 2021, he was indebted to the federal government for \ndelinquent taxes for multiple years. As for the federal or state income tax returns that had \nnot been timely filed, all those unfiled income tax returns had been filed in early 2019. (Tr. \nat 76) \nApplicant explained that because he frequently traveled, his wife handled the \nfamily finances. (Tr. at 57) He also contended that his partner Mr. P was responsible for \nthe business operations of their Chapter S Corporation \u2013 an organization that had \napproximately 65 employees at one point, but by 2014 had dropped down to 4 employees \n\u2013 and Applicant and his first wife were partners as well. (Tr. at 69-71) He used \nprofessional tax preparers for both the corporate and individual income taxes. In January \n2015, when the IRS started investigating the company, according to Applicant, Mr. P \ndestroyed all the corporate records. (Tr. at 96) As a result, Applicant was unable to submit \nany of the S Corporation income tax documents for my review. (Tr. at 112) Although \nApplicant tried working with the IRS, his request for a payment plan was rejected. It also \nrefused any person-to-person discussions. Mr. P was also a target of the IRS.

Applicant initially said that he was in a dark place at \nthe time and attributed at least some of the problems to his divorce and his need to pay \nchild support and alimony. (Tr. at 75) He subsequently acknowledged that the divorce \nreally did not have anything to do with his failure to file his income tax returns or his failure \nto pay his taxes. (Tr. at 111) \nApplicant claimed to have made some payments to both the IRS and one particular \nstate, and intends to pay what he owes regardless of how long it takes. (Tr. at 103-104) \nAlthough he and his attorneys made numerous efforts to deal with several IRS \nrepresentatives, the COVID-19 pandemic health protocols and reduced workforce limited \nhis access and purportedly restricted his rights under the Taxpayers Bill of Rights. He \nmade several attempts to lower garnishment amounts because the amounts being taken \nfrom him was creating severe financial hardships and he did not have enough funds to \nmaintain his basic living standards. (AE N) \nThe SOR alleged ten different financial issues associated with his failure to either \ntimely file federal or state income tax returns or pay income taxes over a multi-year period, \nas well as that federal or state tax liens had been filed, as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a federal tax lien entered against Applicant in multiple states \nin January 2021 in the approximate amount of $884,063. (GE 3) The amount covers\nunpaid tax for the tax years 2009 through 2013 as well as statutory additions. (GE 2 Notice\nof Levy on Wages, Salary, and Other Income (Form 668-W), dated February 3, 2021);\nGE 5) Applicant claimed that the business was audited for 2009 and 2010 taxes, and it \nwas completed in 2013, when the company was assessed $884,063. Of that amount, he \nclaimed that 51 percent ($450,872.13) should be his responsibility with the remaining 49\npercent the responsibility of his business partner. Of Applicant\u2019s 51 percent, he felt that \none-half of that amount ($225,436.07) should be his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. He initially\ncontended that he paid more than $70,000 of the money owed, and has the assistance \nof attorneys to represent him with the IRS. (Answer to SOR at 1) He is in the process of\nresolving the lien. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to the 2009 federal income tax that is alleged as being delinquent \nin the amount of $314,318. Applicant applied for and received an automatic extension of \ntime to file his Individual Income Tax Return (Form 1040) and it was extended until \nOctober 15, 2010. Calculations by his tax preparer were not completed until November \n3, 2010, and it estimated an adjusted gross income of -$167,976 and that he was owed \na refund of $93,919. (GE 7 at 24, 29-31) The delinquent tax liability is also included in the \nForm 668-W referred to, and alleged in, SOR \u00b6 1.a. During the period November 29, \n2021, through September 28, 2022, he made 17 monthly $2,775 payments to the IRS, \ntotaling $47,175, supported by verifying documentation.

It is unclear if Applicant applied for an automatic extension of \ntime to file his Form 1040, but it appears that he did so because the copy is dated by the \ntax preparer on October 15, 2011.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec.

Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2016, \nand his state income tax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. In addition, \nbecause he failed to pay his federal and state income taxes for a multi-year period, federal \nand state tax liens were entered against him. The federal tax lien was in the approximate \namount of $884,063, and the state tax lien was in the approximate amount of $147,353. \nThe IRS levy resulted in substantial amounts of money being taken from his salary, but \nthere is still a large unpaid balance remaining. The state lien was released in November \n2019 when Applicant paid it off. On February 22, 2019 \u2013 well before the SOR was issued \n\u2013 Applicant\u2019s tax preparer completed that 2016 federal income tax return and submitted \nit to the IRS. Applicant\u2019s explanation regarding the late filing of the income tax return is \nnot a legal justification for inaction. Likewise, while the state income tax returns for the \ntax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 were finally filed on February 28, 2019 \u2013 also well before \nthe SOR was issued \u2013 they were still not timely filed. \nThe legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an \nindividual\u2019s gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that \nthere is an obligation to so file, the following applies: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or \nrequired by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make \na return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to \npay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or \nsupply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, \nshall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than \n$25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more \nthan 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.

In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the \nfirst sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting \"felony\" for \n\"misdemeanor\" and \"5 years\" for \"1 year.\" \n(26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax.) \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),19(c), and 19(f) have been established, but there is no evidence that \nApplicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \n\u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(e), and 20(g) partially apply. Applicant \nacknowledged having some financial issues as far back as June 2018 when he submitted \nhis SF 86. However, those financial issues actually arose before 2007 when the first \nfederal tax lien was entered against him. A debt that became delinquent several years \nago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a \ncontinuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the \nGuideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). This case involves two \nseparate financial issues: the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, \nand the failure to pay federal and state income taxes. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues essentially to a combination of factors. He \ninitially claimed that his business partner Mr. P was responsible, and then referred to \nbeing in a dark place because of marital issues that eventually led him to have to pay \nalimony and child support. Added to the mix was the IRS\u2019s refusal to meet personally with \nhim or his attorneys to discuss the federal tax issues and the COVID-19 protocols that \ncaused months to pass without significant discussions. Even if he did not have sufficient \nfunds to pay his income taxes, he was still required to timely file his income tax returns. \nApplicant should have been aware that as far back as before 2009, there were income \ntax issues. He should have been more attentive to those issues at that time. Instead, he \nsimply permitted the process to remain unchanged with Mr. P handling the finances and \nhis tax preparer continuing to file (or not file) various corporate and individual income tax \nreturns without more substantial oversight. Applicant\u2019s failure to more timely address his \nfederal and state income tax issues lead to a conclusion that his delayed voluntary actions \nor longstanding inaction until 2019 were to some degree irresponsible. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). In \nthis instance, Applicant completed his SF 86 in June 2018; underwent his OPM interview \nin October 2018. Yet, it was not until February 2019 that he filed the delinquent federal \nand state income tax returns. The SOR was issued on August 13, 2021. Each step of the \ninitial security clearance eligibility review process placed him on notice of the significance \nof the financial issues confronting him. By failing to rectify the status of his federal and \nstate income tax return filings over such a lengthy multi-year period, Applicant failed to \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. While the IRS and the state governments filed tax liens \nagainst him, Applicant is credited with the timely payment of taxes to release the state tax \nlien in November 2019 \u2013 also well before the SOR was issued. However, because the \nfederal tax lien was so incredibly high, the IRS levied against his wages and took \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nsignificant amounts from him each month. But he still owes a substantial amount of unpaid \nincome taxes. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, there are some promises, along \nwith substantial involuntary payments and some voluntary payments. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSeveral years ago, well before the SOR was issued, Applicant started the effort to \naddress his financial issues. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and health \nprotocols, as well as manpower shortages at the IRS, meaningful discussions between \nApplicant\u2019s attorneys, accountants, and the IRS were seemingly impossible. As noticed \nabove, while there were issues involving the individual income tax returns, there were no \ndocuments associated with the S Corporation offered into evidence, and it is unclear if \nthe IRS was concerned with those income tax returns or merely with the individual income \ntax returns. Still, Applicant was able to partially address his financial issues. The Appeal \nBoard has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is evidence of financial counseling and a budget. Nevertheless, it remains \ndifficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen because of continuing difficulties in making his monthly payments under the federal \ntax levy. While, in this instance, the IRS did not furnish guidance or afford access to a \nreasonable degree because of the national health pandemic issues, Applicant\u2019s actions, \nor inaction, for such a long period between 2009 and 2019, under the circumstances cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. \n09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept regarding \nApplicant\u2019s financial considerations. Applicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense \ncontractor. He has been serving as a senior geospatial subject matter expert with his \ncurrent employer since about October 2017. He was a self-employed consultant from \nJanuary 2016 until October 2017, and from December 2001 until December 2015, he was \nthe president and chief executive officer of his own company, a Chapter S Corporation. \nHe was previously a program manager with another federal contractor from December \n1997 until December 2001. A 1978 high school graduate, he earned approximately 165 \nhours towards a college degree, but he has not earned that degree. He enlisted in the \nU.S. Army in August 1978, and served on active duty until January 1990, when he was \nhonorably discharged as a staff sergeant (E-6). He has been granted a variety of security \nclearances (secret, top secret, and SCI) since about 1978. He is a well-respected \ngeospatial subject matter expert who has served on the front line with deployed troops. \nHe self-reported income tax problems and made some efforts to resolve them, eventually \nfiling all his delinquent federal and state income tax returns, satisfying a state tax lien, \ntrying to deal with the IRS during the COVID-19 pandemic, and paying substantial sums \nto the IRS to resolve his federal tax lien. He may have been the victim of inappropriate \nfinancial actions by his former business partner. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \u2013 not \nmuch more \u2013 substantial. Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for \nthe tax year 2016, and his state income tax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, and \n2017. In addition, because he failed to pay his federal and state income taxes for a multi-\nyear period, federal and state tax liens were entered against him. The federal tax lien was \nin the approximate amount of $884,063, and the state tax lien was in the approximate \namount of $147,353. The IRS levy resulted in substantial amounts of money being taken \nfrom his salary, but there is still a large unpaid balance remaining. The state lien was \nreleased in November 2019 when Applicant paid it off. On February 22, 2019 \u2013 well before \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe SOR was issued \u2013 Applicant\u2019s tax preparer completed that 2016 federal income tax \nreturn and submitted it to the IRS. Applicant\u2019s explanation regarding the late filing of the \nincome tax return is not a legal justification for inaction. Likewise, while the state income \ntax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 were finally filed on February 28, 2019 \n\u2013 also well before the SOR was issued \u2013 they were still not timely filed. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve the debts is \ngrowing and improving. However, while some of his recent efforts have been reasonable, \npositive, and encouraging, his failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns \nuntil 2019 \u2013 well before the pandemic appeared \u2013 was not reasonable. Overall, the \nevidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. \nA, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \nFor Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.c.: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n16 \n",

(Tr. at 105-108, 111-113; GE 1-3) \nApplicant estimated, in his July 2021 response to interrogatories, that he: (1) owed \nfederal taxes in the amounts of $16,000 and $14,000, respectively, for TY 2014 and 2015; \n(2) anticipated a federal refund of $13,000 for TY 2017, and credits of $7,837 and $1,862, \nrespectively, for TY 2018 and 2019; and (3) owed $7,500 in federal taxes after his federal \nrefund and overpayments from TY 2017, 2018, and 2019 were applied to his outstanding \nfederal taxes. Having not yet filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2016 and 2020, \nhe expected to owe federal taxes for TY 2016, and he anticipated a federal refund for TY \n2020.

Applicant described the first seven and a half years of his marriage \nas toxic. He found himself in a state of constant chaos and conflict, in which his spouse \nsubjected him to mental, verbal, and emotional abuse. At times, she threatened to take \ntheir children and file divorce, and she reported him to law enforcement on several \noccasions after they argued. The stress from his marriage impacted his health.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file his relevant federal and state income tax returns. He \nalso owed delinquent federal and state taxes.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He did not seek help with \nfiling his relevant delinquent income tax returns until around 2016. While he worked with \ntwo accounting firms and a tax resolution company between 2016 and 2018, and he \nreceived credit counseling from the tax resolution company in 2018, he did not follow \nthrough on the tax resolution company\u2019s request, in 2018, for additional information. His \nown efforts at filing his relevant delinquent income tax returns only occurred between \n2020 and 2022. \nApplicant untimely filed his federal and state income tax return for TY 2018 in 2021. \nHis completed tax documentation, and copies of his September 2020 and September \n2022 receipts addressed to the IRS, do not corroborate his claims that he filed his federal \nand state income tax returns for TY 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020. Even if I \nwere to accept that they do, he has not demonstrated that the IRS or the state tax \nauthority have accepted his income tax returns. Moreover, while his tax documentation, \n2021 payment to the state tax authority, and 2022 satisfaction of a state tax lien appear \nto demonstrate that he has resolved his outstanding state taxes, he continues to have \noutstanding federal income taxes. He has not demonstrated that he has arranged with \nthe IRS to resolve his outstanding federal income taxes.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did \nnot mitigate the financial considerations security concerns arising from his history of \nunfiled tax returns and unpaid taxes. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties \nof a supply technician. He began working at his present job in December 2019. He \npreviously worked for a federal contractor from 2009 until October 2017 when he was laid \noff. He was unemployed for five to six weeks when he took a position with a substantial \npay cut. At the time of his lay off, he was earning approximately $65,000 yearly. When he \nwas hired after the layoff, he earned approximately $30,000 annually. He is a high school \ngraduate. He is married and has two adult children, one of whom still resides with him \nand his wife. Applicant financially supports this child along with three grandchildren, ages \nthree, one, and an infant. (Tr. 6, 18-19, 21-23; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged 15 delinquent accounts (credit cards, consumer debt, a time\u00ad\nshare debt, and medical debts) totaling approximately $52,752. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.o) The \ndebts are established by credit reports from October 2020, April 2021, and September \n2022; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator in January 2021; \nand his SOR admissions. (GE 2-5; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began after he was laid off in 2017. Then he was \nunderemployed after his five-to-six-week layoff from 2017 until he was hired by his current \nemployer in 2019. He started at the salary of $63,000 in 2019. He also has been \nsupporting his daughter and her three children. He has not received any financial \ncounseling, but he developed his own plan to deal with his delinquent debts. That plan is \nfor him to save enough money to pay one debt at a time and then move to the next debt. \nUsing this plan, he has paid four debts (one was a non-SOR debt) and has an established \npayment plan for a fifth debt. His wife works and makes approximately $100,000 per year, \nbut they keep their finances separate and he admitted that most of the SOR debt is his \nalone. The exception is the time-share debt (SOR \u00b6 1.n), which is a joint debt with his \nwife.

(Tr. 23-24, 26-27, 44, 53; AE D, E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties dating back to 2017. Additionally, he \nincurred 15 delinquent debts totaling, approximately $52,000. Eleven of the debts remain \nunpaid. Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports establish the debts. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing. Although he paid three of \nthe debts and is making payments on a fourth debt, he failed to address the remaining \ndebts, which comprise the majority of the overall debt amount. Additionally, two of the \ndebts were not paid until after the issuance of Applicant\u2019s SOR in April 2021. AG \u00b6 20(a) \nis not applicable. \nApplicant presented evidence that the debts were affected by circumstances \nbeyond his control, namely, his unemployment and underemployment, and the need to \nprovide financial support to his daughter and his three grandchildren. However, he did not \nact responsibly concerning the debts when he failed to resolve them in a timely fashion. \nAG \u00b6 20(b), therefore, has some application, but does not fully apply. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. His track record to date \ndoes not support a good financial picture. Based upon his past history, there is no reason \nto believe that he will right his financial ship in the future. While he did resolve several \ndebts, these actions are too little, too late. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies only to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.m, and \n1.o. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI \nconsidered \nApplicant\u2019s \ncontractor \nservice, \nhis \nunemployment, \nhis \nunderemployment, and the financial support he provides to his daughter and \ngrandchildren. However, I also considered that he has not adequately addressed his \ndelinquent debt. He has not established a meaningful track record of debt management, \nwhich causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.e, 1.g-1.l, 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.c, 1.f, 1.m, 1.o:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Answer 1; Answer 2; GE 1-7) \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to his financial immaturity, \nmismanagement, and a lack of income. In addition, his former girlfriend became \nunemployed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and her inability to contribute to their \nhousehold expenses compounded his financial problems. He began working with a \nnonprofit credit counseling agency in September 2022 to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.o, as well a \ncredit card not alleged in the SOR that was not delinquent. He pays the credit counseling \nagency $273 monthly, and the agency makes payments to both creditors on his behalf. \n(Tr. at 30, 43-45, 48-51, 53-55, 65-66, 69-75, 105-107, 109-110, 112-114, 116-119, 121-\n123, 125-126; GE 7; AE I-K, P-Q) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a $13,158 charged-off auto loan. Applicant co-signed this loan with \nhis former girlfriend in approximately 2015, with the understanding that she was \nresponsible for repaying it. She stopped paying the loan when they ended their \nrelationship shortly after they purchased the car. When the creditor contacted him at an \nunrecalled date, he made several payments of an unrecalled amount until he could no \nlonger afford to do so, and then the creditor repossessed his former girlfriend\u2019s car. He \nmade a mistake co-signing this loan for his former girlfriend, and he learned not to co-\nsign for anyone in the future. In approximately 2018, he made several payments of an \nunrecalled amount, but he could not consistently afford to do so. He contacted the creditor \nin approximately August 2022. In September 2022, he reached a payment arrangement \nwith the law firm collecting the debt on the creditor\u2019s behalf, consisting of bi-weekly \npayments of $170. He made two payments of $340 in October 2022 and November 2022, \nand he set up the remaining payments through automatic deductions.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g) After his 2011 graduation, he made an unrecalled \nnumber of monthly payments, between $100 and $150, but stopped because he could no \nlonger afford such payments. He believed his loans were then deferred until an unrecalled \ndate. The creditor garnished $366 from his wages bi-weekly, from December 2019 to April \n2020, and then stopped due to the COVID-19 student loan payment pause. He made a \n$30 payment in August 2021. In September 2022, he contacted the creditor and entered \ninto a rehabilitation agreement consisting of $5 monthly payments for nine to ten months, \nafter which time the creditor would determine a new monthly payment plan. He scheduled \nhis $5 monthly payments for automatic deductions. Although his payments were paused \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic forbearance, he made a $100 payment in October 2022, \nand his first $5 payment under the rehabilitation agreement was scheduled for January \n2023. He intends to comply with the rehabilitation agreement and continue to resolve his \nstudent loans.

He consolidated and settled SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k through 1.m \nand made an initial payment of $40 in August 2021; he made $50 monthly payments from \nSeptember 2021 to July 2022; and the creditor notified him in August 2022 that he paid \nthese debts. He reached a preauthorized recurring payment arrangement for SOR \u00b6 1.l, \nconsisting of a one-time payment of $40 in August 2021, followed by $50 monthly \npayments from September 2021 to October 2022. (Answer 1; Tr. at 35-37, 40-41, 84-87; \nGE 1, 3, 4; AE E, G, H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a $453 collection account with a pet hospital. Applicant settled this \ndebt for $295 in August 2021. In July 2022, his outstanding balance was zero after he \nmade a final payment of $147. (Answer 1; Tr. at 37-40, 85; AE F) \nSOR \u00b6 1.n is an $84 gym account in collection. Applicant was unaware of this debt \nuntil he received the SOR. He paid this debt in August 2021. (Answer 1; Tr. at 41-42, 87-\n95; AE H)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.o is a $704 past-due loan. Applicant obtained a $10,000 loan in March \n2020 so that he could pay his daily living expenses, and he missed one or two payments \non the loan. He was resolving this debt through the credit counseling agency, as \ndiscussed above, and the loan was in good standing. The credit counseling agency made \na payment on his behalf to this creditor in September 2022 and October 2022, for $203 \nand $211, respectively. (Tr. at 42-45, 66-75, 109-110; GE 1, 7; AE I-K) \nSOR \u00b6 1.p is a $2,484 judgment entered against Applicant in October 2019 for an \neviction action filed by his former landlord. Applicant lived in this apartment complex with \nhis former girlfriend until several weeks before the hearing, when he moved in with his \nparents. He did not receive any court notices concerning eviction proceedings filed by this \nlandlord, and he was never evicted from this apartment. He acknowledged that he was \ndelinquent in his rent payments. Applicant contacted the creditor in August 2022 and was \nin the process of negotiating a payment arrangement to resolve this debt. He made a \n$1,000 payment in November 2022 as a showing of good faith. (Tr. at 45-50, 95-107, \n113-116, 121-123; GE 6; AE K, O, Q) \nAt least five eviction actions were brought against Applicant from 2015 to 2021, for \nfailure to timely pay his rent. As with SOR \u00b6 1.p, he maintained that he never received \ncourt notices concerning eviction proceedings, and he was never evicted from any of his \nresidences. He acknowledged that he was delinquent in his rent payments at various \nresidences, and he received notices from his landlords concerning his delinquent rent. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.q; Tr. at 51-53, 95-107, 115-116, 121-123; GE 6) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant developed a budget with the help of the credit counseling agency. He \nmoved in with his parents several weeks before the hearing to save money so that he \ncould continue to resolve his debts. His annual salary in 2018, when he started working \nfor his employer, was $83,000; as of the date of the hearing, it was approximately \n$92,000. His monthly net income was $4,116, and his monthly net remainder was \napproximately $1,769 after expenses, which included payments to the credit counseling \nagency. He also received credit counseling through the credit counseling agency, through \nwhich he learned how to manage his expenses with a budget and how to begin a savings \naccount. He understood the importance of responsibly managing his finances. His \nmanager rated his performance favorably for the July 2019 to July 2020 rating period. \nShe described him as reliable and stated that he was \u201cturning into one of my go[-]to team \nmembers.\u201d Ten individuals, to include a sibling, life-long friends, former coworkers, and \ncoworkers, attested to his trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment (GE 7-8, 23-24, 43-\n45, 48-51, 53-65, 107-109, 111-121, 125-126; AE I-K, M-N, P-Q) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and, \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay his debts. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payment on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in \nthe SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant does not have any other delinquent debts. He received credit counseling \nthrough the credit counseling agency. He has demonstrated a good-faith effort to address \nhis debts, and he has the means to continue to resolve his remaining debts. I find that \nApplicant\u2019s finances do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are established. \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He made some payments \ntoward SOR \u00b6 1.a in approximately 2018, before he received the SOR, but stopped \nbecause he could no longer afford to do so. He was unaware of most of his debts, to \ninclude the eviction actions brought against him between 2015 and 2021, until he received \nthe SOR. Once he learned about his debts, he took action to resolve them. \nApplicant paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n. He had payment \narrangements for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g. He made payments in accordance with his \narrangement for SOR \u00b6 1.a in October 2022 and November 2022, and his payments for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g were scheduled to begin in January 2023. Apart from that, he \nmade two payments of $30 and $100, toward SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g, in August 2021 \nand October 2022, respectively. Since September 2022, he was working to resolve SOR \n\u00b6 1.o through the credit counseling agency, who made two payments of $203 and $211 \non his behalf in September 2022 and October 2022, respectively. He contacted the \ncreditor for SOR \u00b6 1.p in August 2022 and was in the process of negotiating a payment \narrangement to resolve this debt, and he made a $1,000 payment in November 2022 as \na showing of good faith. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.q: \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(TR at page 27 line \n11 to page 28 line 5.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had significant past-due indebtedness and late income tax filings. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has addressed all of his alleged past-due indebtedness and delinquent \nincome tax filings. These delinquencies are attributed to a period of unemployment due \nto Covid-19. He has demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20 has been established. Financial Considerations is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(AE A) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling $32,275, and their status is as \nfollows. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent child-support account placed for collection for \n$5,157. Applicant\u2019s weekly child-support responsibility is $138 for his 15-year-old son. \n(Tr. 34) The payments are made automatically from his paycheck. (Tr. 34) Applicant was \nin jail for nine months (February to October 2019) because he was charged with rape, \nand he was unable to pay his child support. (Tr. 33) His August 11, 2020 credit report \nindicates the account is $5,814 delinquent. (Tr. 34; GE 2 at 4) Applicant\u2019s November 17, \n2022 child-support statement shows his current arrearage is $2,571. (Tr. 36; AE C) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.i allege three charged-off accounts for $2,030, $1,287, and \n$139. The $2,030 debt was for the purchase of a vehicle. (Tr. 36) He said the $2,030 \naccount was current before he was arrested for rape. (Tr. 36) The debt for $1,287 was a \npersonal loan for a trailer. (Tr. 37) On December 10, 2021, the creditor wrote the $1,287 \ndebt was satisfied. (AE G) Applicant said the other accounts were paid around April 2022. \n(Tr. 36-38, 42) He provided a December 10, 2021 account statement showing a loan \npayoff of $1,200 of a $3,570 balance for one account.

(AE F) I accept his verbal averment that all three debts are resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.h allege five medical accounts placed for collection for $523, \n$368, $279, $222, and $174. Applicant said he paid the $523 medical debt a few months \nago. (Tr. 38) He believed he paid some of the other medical debts; however, he was \ncontesting some medical debts because his son may be responsible for them.

Court records indicate in July 2019, \nhe as indicted based on a grand jury true bill; he was arraigned; and in October 2019, the \ncharge was nolle prosequi. (GE 5 at 3) There was a search warrant for the sheets \nbecause Ms. A described the sheets and said he ejaculated on the sheets after the rape. \n(GE 6) Applicant denied that he ejaculated on the sheets. (Tr. 81; GE 6 at 3, 9) The police \nfound the sheets Ms. A described in Applicant\u2019s washer when the search warrant was \nexecuted. (GE 6 at 9) Applicant said the police did not have his DNA or other physical \nevidence to corroborate Ms. A\u2019s allegation of rape. (Tr. 25, 68, 81-82) Ms. A was present \nfor one court hearing; she failed to appear at court for the next hearing; and the charge \nwas dismissed. (Tr. 25) Applicant was in jail for nine months. (Tr. 25) He was reinstated \nat his job. (Tr. 71) \nApplicant said a week before he met Ms. A, he applied for a passport because he \nwas planning a trip outside the country. (Tr. 24) He did not provide a copy of his passport \napplication. He met Ms. A through an online account. (Tr. 56) Ms. A was 38 years old. \n(Tr. 56) He met Ms. A for the first time in person at a gym in February 2019, and she went \nto his residence, where he received oral sex from her. (Tr. 21, 56, 72-74) The following \nday, he purchased the parts to repair Ms. A\u2019s brakes on her car, and he went to Ms. A\u2019s \nresidence to work on the brakes of her car. (Tr. 21-22, 57-58) The third day, Ms. A came \nto Applicant\u2019s residence around midnight to watch a movie. (Tr. 58) She went outside of \nhis house to smoke marijuana. (Tr. 77) He said Ms. A was intoxicated when she was at \nhis residence. (Tr. 57-58) Even though he had fixed her brakes the previous day, it \u201cnever \ncrossed his mind\u201d that she was coming over to his residence to engage in sexual activity \nwith him. (Tr. 89-90) \nMs. A said that she and Applicant were in bed watching a movie, and he put her \nhand on his penis. (GE 6 at 6) She told him that she was not doing that, and he said, \u201cI\u2019ll \nbe damned.\u201d (Id.) Applicant got on top of her, pulled her pants down, pushed her legs \napart, and engaged in sexual intercourse with her against her will. (Id.) She screamed \nand yelled that she did not want Applicant to have sexual intercourse with her. (Id.) \nApplicant denied that he put her hand on his penis, climbed on top of her, and \nengaged in sexual intercourse with her. (Tr. 75-77) He said she slept on his sofa, and she \ndid not sleep in his bed. (Tr. 87) He did not explain why she engaged in oral sex with him \nand then two days later refused his sexual advances. (Tr. 77-78) \nApplicant said he went to the restroom to take a shower, and when he came back \ninto the room where he left his wallet, he noticed his wallet had moved. (Tr. 22, 59, 78) \nHe believed Ms. A had gone through his wallet; he checked the contents of his wallet; \nand he noticed one of his bank cards was missing from his wallet. (Tr. 22, 78) He accused \nMs. A of taking his bank card. (Tr. 22) \nIn response to Applicant\u2019s accusation, Ms. A said \u201cyou don\u2019t believe me, then I\u2019ll \nstrip for you, and show you I ain\u2019t got it.\u201d (Tr. 22) Ms. A took off her pants; she pulled down \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher panties; she pulled up her shirt; and his credit card fell out from under her bra strap \nonto the floor.

(Tr. 23, 80-82) \nAt about 7:00 a.m., Ms. A backed her car into the street, and she hit another car \nthat Ms. B was driving down the street. (Tr. 23, 59, 83) Applicant said Ms. A drove away \nwithout telling Ms. B her contact information. Applicant advised Ms. B about Ms. A\u2019s \ncontact information. (Tr. 23) About three minutes later, Ms. A drove back to Applicant\u2019s \nresidence and almost hit him with her vehicle. (Tr. 23, 83) According to Applicant, Ms. A \ncomplained about him providing information to Ms. B, she said \u201cyou so-and-so, you gave \nmy f\u2019n information to that lady.\u201d (Tr. 83) Ms. A continued, \u201c. . . well you gave the lady my \ninformation. I\u2019m going to tell the police you raped me.\u201d (Tr. 23, 81, 84) He did not know \nwhether Ms. B heard Ms. A make this threat. (Tr. 84) \nPolice officers went to Applicant\u2019s residence because of a report of an accident \nwith no injuries. (GE 6 at 3) Ms. A told the police that she stayed overnight at Applicant\u2019s \nresidence; he made sexual advances; she told him to stop; he got on top of her, pulled \ndown her pants; and raped her. (Id.) The police report does not mention where Applicant \nwas located when the police were getting the initial report from Ms. A. (Id.) Later the \nmorning of accident, the police searched Applicant\u2019s residence. (Id. at 5) Applicant was \nnot present during the search. (Id. at 6)  \nA few hours later, the sheriff\u2019s office called Applicant, advised him of Ms. A\u2019s \nallegations, and asked him what happened. (Tr. 24; GE 6 at 7) He denied that anything \nhappened except Ms. A hit Ms. B with Ms. A\u2019s vehicle. (Tr. 61, 91) The sheriff\u2019s office \nasked him to come to their office; Applicant said he would be there in 20 minutes; \nApplicant contacted an attorney; and his attorney advised him that he did not need to go \nto the sheriff\u2019s office. (Tr. 24, 84; GE 6 at 7) \nShortly after the alleged rape, Applicant sent Ms. A several texts apologizing to \nher. (Tr. 86) Copies of the texts are not part of the record, and Applicant said he did not \nretain copies of the texts. (Tr. 87) He said he sent the texts to show he was being \nreasonable and holding his cool. (Tr. 87) \nA warrant for his arrest was issued; however, Applicant said he was unaware a \nwarrant had been issued until after he had already started his trip to another country. (Tr. \n24, 60, 62) The September 10, 2020 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal \nsubject interview (PSI) states Applicant\u2019s brother told him about the arrest warrant before \nhe left the jurisdiction where the arrest warrant was issued. (GE 8 at 5) At his hearing, at \nfirst, he said he bought his airline ticket with his bank card. (Tr. 85) Then he said his \nbrother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 bought the ticket online. (Tr. 86) He flew out of the state where he is a \nresident four days after the arrest warrant was issued. (Tr. 85) He could have cancelled \nhis flight and returned to his state of residence. (Tr. 62) At his hearing, he admitted that \nhe elected to continue his trip after he learned of the warrant. (Tr. 24, 61-62) He was \narrested at an airport where he was going to take a connecting flight outside the country. \n(Tr. 24, 61-62) He spent 28 days in jail in the state where he was arrested before he was \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextradited back to his residence state.

(Tr. 63)  \nApplicant believed Ms. A went through his wallet while he was in the shower and \nhad written down his credit card numbers. (Tr. 22) Several weeks after the incident \ninvolving Ms. A, he noticed $400 in charges on one of his accounts, and he believed that \nMs. A made them. (Tr. 68-69) He did not tell the police that he believed Ms. A had \ncommitted a $400 larceny. (Tr. 68) He did not pay the $400 bill. (Tr. 69) He said Ms. A \nlied about her place of employment. (Tr. 88-89) \nCredibility \nIn 1987, when Applicant was 16 or 17 years old, he was arrested for three \nallegations of second degree burglary based on his breaking and entering into \ncommercial establishments to steal appliances and televisions. (Tr. 65; GE 8 at 6) In \n1988, he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail. (Id.) He served about four years \nin jail. (Id.) \nIn 1998, Applicant was arrested for making a false statement, a felony offense, \nwhen he applied for a concealed carry permit because he failed to disclose his felony \nconviction in 1988. (GE 8 at 6) He was subsequently convicted of making a false \nstatement. (Id.) He was sentenced to pay a fine, and he was placed on probation. (Id.) \nSection 22 of Applicant\u2019s April 12, 2018 SCA asked \u201cHave you EVER been \ncharged with any felony offense?\u201d (GE 1 at 26 (emphasis in original)) Applicant answered, \nno, and did not disclose these felony charges. (Id. at 27) He said he did not disclose his \nfelonies because he thought they did not meet the reporting criteria.  (GE 8 at 6) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling $32,275. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further discussion of the disqualifying \nconditions and the applicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant described a circumstance which he believed was beyond his control that \nadversely affected his finances. He was in jail for nine months in 2019. The circumstance \nwas not beyond his control as he was in jail without bail because he attempted to flee the \njurisdiction. \nThe financial allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j are mitigated. He either paid, \ndisputed, or the creditor was unable to locate these debts, and they no longer appear on \nhis credit reports as delinquent. He made enough progress on his child-support debt to \nshow good faith. \nApplicant is not credited with mitigating the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, a charged-off \naccount for $11,508. He employed two CRCs to dispute negative items on his credit \nreport, and the SOR \u00b6 1.k debt was dropped from his credit report. He acknowledged he \nwas responsible for this debt, and he did not make any payments. \nA \u201ccharged-off debt\u201d is an accounting entry. A creditor considers a debt owed to \nthe creditor to be an asset. When the value of the asset is in doubt, the creditor is required \nto change the status of the debt to reflect its current status. When the debt appears to be \nuncollectible, the creditor should change the status for accounting purposes from being \nan asset to charged off. Notwithstanding the change to charged-off status, a creditor may \nstill sell the debt to a collection agent, and the debtor may still pay or settle the debt. \nEventually, the charged-off debts will be dropped from the debtor\u2019s credit report. \u201c[T]hat \nsome debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd.

Dec. 29, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03747 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2015)). \nApplicant and his spouse have a total gross annual income of about $180,000. He \nhas $20,000 in his savings account. He did not establish that he was unable to make \nmore progress sooner in the resolution of the SOR \u00b6 1.k debt. He did not establish a track \nrecord of consistent payments on this debt, and there is insufficient assurance that this \ndebt is being resolved. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether \nthe individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nIn July 2019, a grand jury indicted Applicant for rape. The evidentiary standard for \na grand jury indictment is probable cause to believe the defendant committed the offense. \nUnited States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U.S. 418, 423 (1983). Probable cause exists \nwhere the facts and circumstances are reasonably trustworthy and \u201csufficient in \nthemselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been \n. . . committed.\u201d Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 176 (1949). See also Texas v. \nBrown, 460 U.S. 730, 742 (1983) (plurality opinion) (probable cause does not require a \nfact to be \u201cmore likely true than false\u201d); Escobedo v. United States, 623 F.2d 1098, 1102 \n(5th Cir. 1980) (\u201cprobable cause\u201d means \u201cthe existence of a reasonable ground to believe \nthe accused guilty\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cFinely-tuned standards such as \nproof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence, useful in formal \ntrials, have no place in the [probable-cause] decision.\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 235 \n(1983). \nThe government had the initial burden of proving Applicant committed rape. \nSecurity clearance proceedings employ the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d evidentiary standard, \nwhich is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. \nArea Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion.\u201d Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971). See ISCR Case No. 15-\n05049 at 4 (App. Bd.

Applicant\u2019s grand jury \nindictment is not given any weight in the determination of whether there is substantial \nevidence that Applicant committed rape. \nIn ISCR Case No. 18-02018 at 4 (App. Bb. Nov. 4, 2021) the administrative judge \nconcluded that the applicant in that case committed a sexual assault even though that \napplicant was never arrested or charged with sexual assault. The Appeal Board affirmed \nthe denial of the applicant\u2019s security clearance and explained that law enforcement and \nprosecutorial determinations do not limit an administrative judge in his or her assessment \nof criminal charges as follows: \n\u201cIn DOHA proceedings, a Judge can make findings of criminal conduct even \nif the applicant has not been formally charged with a criminal offense by the \nrelevant criminal authorities.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04931 at 4 (App. \nBd. Jun. 3, 2005). See also, ISCR Case No. 17-00506 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n7, 2018) (\u201cEven if criminal charges are reduced, dropped, or result in an \nacquittal, the Judge may still consider the underlying conduct in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.\u201d). A disqualifying condition at \nissue in this case highlights this point. Under Disqualifying Condition 13(a), \na security concern could arise from \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, \nwhether or not the individual has been prosecuted.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. \nA \u00b6 13(a) (emphasis added). In this case, the Judge\u2019s determination that \n[a]pplicant committed a sexual assault is merely an administrative \nconclusion that substantial evidence exists in the record to establish \n[a]pplicant engaged in security-significant conduct. Applicant failed to \nestablish that the Judge acted beyond the authority provided him in the \nDirective when he concluded Applicant committed a sexual assault. \nAG \u00b6 31(b) is established. Ms. A said she expressed her desire not to engage in \nsexual intercourse with Applicant. Nevertheless, Applicant overcame her resistance and \nengaged in sexual intercourse with her without her consent. She left his residence in a \nhurry, and she accidentally struck Ms. B\u2019s vehicle. She promptly reported the rape to law \nenforcement. There is substantial evidence Applicant committed the crime of rape, and \nconsideration of mitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \n \n \nApplicant asserts that Ms. A falsely accused him of rape because he told Ms. B \nher identity after Ms. A hit Ms. B\u2019s vehicle. He denied that he engaged in sexual activity \nwith Ms. A on the date she alleged he raped her. \u201cThere is no rule of evidence that \ncompels the Judge to accept an applicant\u2019s statement merely because it is not rebutted \nby record evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01361 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2021) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 99-0005 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2000)). In this instance, Applicant statement \ndenying the rape was rebutted by Ms. A\u2019s statement as summarized in the police report. \nMs. A\u2019s statement about being raped is more credible than Applicant\u2019s statement \ndenying the rape. She was in such a rush to leave his residence that she ran out of his \nhouse, and then backed out of his driveway so quickly she struck Ms. B\u2019s vehicle. Ms. A \nmade a timely report of the rape to the police. Applicant fled the jurisdiction after he \nlearned there was a warrant for the arrest. He purchased a one-way ticket to a foreign \ncountry using another person\u2019s credit card. He was arrested in another state just before \nhe was going to board a flight to a foreign country. \nThe SOR does not allege: (1) Applicant fled the jurisdiction after an arrest warrant \nwas issued; (2) In 1988, he was convicted of second degree burglary for breaking and \nentering into commercial establishments to steal appliances and televisions; (3) In 1998, \nhe was convicted of making a false statement; (4) He failed to disclose these two felonies \non his April 12, 2018 SCA; and (5) He failed to admit that he engaged in sexual \nintercourse with Ms. A against her wishes and without her consent.

(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citations omitted)). The non-SOR allegations will not be considered except \nfor the five purposes listed above. \nApplicant failed to convincingly rebut Ms. A\u2019s allegation that he raped her. The rape \noffense is recent. He is not rehabilitated. His rape offense continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Criminal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines J and \nF are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old outside machinist employed by a large DOD contractor \nfrom for five years. He has attended college. He is receiving annual pay of about \n$130,000, and he is credited with being an excellent employee. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nApplicant did not provide a good enough reason for his delay in failing to pay or \nestablish a consistent track record of payments for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, especially in \nlight of his and his spouse\u2019s current income, which totals about $180,000 annually. He \nacknowledged his responsibility for this debt, and he failed to provide a good explanation \nfor why he did not use more of his income to address the SOR \u00b6 1.k debt. \nThere is substantial evidence Applicant committed rape in February 2019. He \ndenied that he committed this rape; however, the statement of the victim, Ms. A, is more \ncredible than Applicant\u2019s denial. The rape is recent. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Unmitigated criminal conduct and financial considerations \nsecurity concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is \nnot warranted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",

The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 25, 2023.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old single woman. She is a high school graduate and has \ntaken some college courses. She is a secretary who has been working for various \nemployers in this line of work since 2015, and has been working with her current employer \nsince December 2021. (Tr. 13) \nIn the late 2010s, Applicant worked as the secretary in a chiropractor\u2019s office. (Tr. \n20) She was laid off in March 2020 after the pandemic began and was either unemployed \nor underemployed for the next 20 months. (Tr. 18) During this time, she received rental \nassistance and unemployment compensation. (Tr. 18)  \nApplicant has approximately $25,000 of delinquent debt. The debts alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.a, and 1.f through 1.k are delinquent medical bills, totaling $3,800. \nSubparagraph 1.b is the deficiency from a repossessed car, totaling $7,600, \nsubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d, totaling $15,000, are delinquent student loans, and \nsubparagraph 1.e, totaling $970, is a delinquent credit card. She incurred these bills \nprimarily because through most of her career, she has been living paycheck to paycheck, \nstruggling to pay bills. (Tr. 29) During her lengthy unemployment during the pandemic, \nher struggle to pay bills devolved into a struggle to avoid eviction, as she had to apply for \nrental assistance from her county of residence. (Tr. 18) While unemployed, she briefly \nworked as a grocery delivery driver, but had to stop when her car broke down. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant incurred the medical bills because she did not have medical or dental \ninsurance for several years. (Tr. 16) When she periodically fell ill, she did not want to risk \nher health, so she would go to the emergency room. (Tr. 22) Unable to pay the bills when \nshe received them, she would set them to the side to pay when she could afford them, \nbut then, forget about them. Applicant intends to begin paying these bills after she \nsatisfies more pressing ones. (Tr. 23) \nApplicant purchased a car in 2016. The monthly car note was $315. (Tr. 24) Often \nunable to pay the full amount, she frequently made partial monthly payments. (Tr. 24) \nGradually, the delinquencies from these partial payments \u201cstarted to add up.\u201d (Tr.  24) In \nMarch 2021, the car was repossessed. The amount alleged delinquent in SOR \nsubparagraph 1.b totals the amount delinquent at the time of the repossession. Since the \nrepossession, the holder of the car note resold the car. The remaining deficiency totals \n$2,722. (GE A) Applicant has not yet begun a payment plan to satisfy this debt.

(AE B) \nSubparagraph 1.e, totaling $970, is a credit card. She has not satisfied the \ndelinquency, yet, but has been in contact with the creditor. (Tr. 16) \nApplicant does not maintain a budget and continues to live paycheck to paycheck. \n(Tr. 29) She tracks her bills with a wall calendar to ensure that every time she gets paid, \nshe makes a bill payment. (Tr. 30) She has a job as a bartender to supplement her \nincome. (Tr. 29) She did not submit a copy of the wall calendar. Recently, she took a part-\ntime job. The salary from this job is unknown from the record. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAlthough Applicant was already struggling to pay her debts before losing her job \nafter the pandemic began in 2020, the subsequent 20-month unemployment exacerbated \nher financial problems. Currently, her delinquent student loans do not pose a security risk \nbecause they are under a government-mandated pause. I resolve subparagraphs 1.c and \n1.d in her favor. \nAlthough Applicant provided evidence that her automobile loan delinquency was \nless than alleged, she did not provide evidence of any steps to begin satisfying it. \nSimilarly, she provided no evidence of any payment plans for satisfying the other \nremaining delinquencies. In addition, she does not maintain a budget, and her testimony \nthat she uses a calendar to track her expenses and payments was unsupported by \ndocumentary evidence. Absent concrete proof of a demonstrated track record of financial \nreform, promises to satisfy debts have limited probative value. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial struggles that were perpetuated by the pandemic trigger the partial application \nof AG \u00b6 20(b), but none of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. I conclude Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAlthough circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control partially contributed to her financial \nproblems, she provided minimal evidence establishing what bills she is currently paying, \nor when she will begin paying the delinquencies. Under these circumstances, I conclude \nthat she has not mitigated the security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He had to prioritize fixing the water leak \ninstead of paying the lease on his car. Applicant and his wife were forced to liquidate their \nretirement savings to pay off past-due bills that accumulated during their unexpected \nhealth issues. This created a larger tax bill, given the IRS penalties for early withdrawal \nof retirement savings. Consequently, Applicant was unable to remain current on his debts. \n(SOR Answer) \nApplicant submitted the following summary of documented medical expenses in \n2015 for himself, his wife, and his daughter.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further discussion \nof the disqualifying conditions and the applicability of mitigating conditions is contained in \nthe mitigation section, infra. The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s \nresponsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nThe potentially applicable financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority, \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \nApplicant described and documented numerous circumstances beyond his control, \nwhich adversely affected his finances. In summary, and in a relatively short period of time \nspanning a two-year period, his father passed away; he, his wife, and daughter all had \nserious costly medical issues; his reverse amortized mortgage increased significantly; \nand he had unplanned costly homeowner repair issues. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt, and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd.

Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nA component is whether he maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate \npartial payments to keep debts current. Applicant did provide documentary evidence that \nhe initiated or maintained contact with his creditors well before his SOR was issued. In \nthis case the record is well-documented with Applicant\u2019s efforts to initiate and maintain \ncontact with the IRS as well as his creditors through his DCC.  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant had made payment arrangements with the IRS in various formats since \n2017 and, more recently, in 2021 set up a revised payment plan with the IRS with the \nhelp of his second CPA. His payment plan with the IRS is measured and his payments \nincrease incrementally. Since 2018, Applicant enrolled all of his debts in a plan with a \nDCC. His DCC has paid, settled, or is attempting to settle all of his outstanding SOR \ndebts. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s payment plan with his DCC is also measured. Both of his \npayments to the IRS and the DCC are made by direct debit. Such actions demonstrate \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances and has made and is making a good-\nfaith effort to pay his debts. Additionally, Applicant sought financial counseling and there \nare clear indications that his financial problems are under control. He submitted sufficient \nevidence to dispute the legitimacy of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent indebtedness \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d; and does not impair his ability to protect classified information. As noted, AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a) partially applies. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) through 20(e), and 20(g) fully apply. Security \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further \ncomments are warranted. \nApplicant is a 58-year-old principal fellow (senior technical engineer), who has \nbeen employed by his current defense contractor employer since September 2018. For \nthe past 36 years he spent his adult working life in the defense industry and has \nsuccessfully held security clearances at various levels that entire time. During his long \nand distinguished career, he has contributed to the defense of the United States in very \nsignificant ways. He seeks to retain his Secret security clearance, which is a requirement \nof his continued employment. \nApplicant is a law-abiding citizen and a productive member of society. He is current \non his day-to-day expenses, lives within his means, and his SOR debts have been \nresolved or are in the process of being resolved. Although he still has work to do in paying \ndown his debt, he has a reasonable and well thought out plan in place to accomplish that \ngoal. While paying down his debt, he remains current on his daily expenses and lives \nwithin his means. He has provided evidence of being a productive, loyal, and responsible \nemployee. Having had an opportunity to observe Applicant, and after reviewing the \nsubstantial evidence that he submitted, I am confident that he understands what is \nrequired to maintain financial responsibility. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and supporting \nevidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and my \ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n11 \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.p: \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Applicant has received a bachelor of arts degree and a master\u2019s degree. She is seeking to retain a security clearance granted in approximately 2006 in connection with her work with the DoD. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Applicant Exhibit E.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted both allegations under this paragraph with explanations. Applicant admitted that she used marijuana less than ten times in the 1990s. That use is not alleged in the SOR and is in the distant past. This use has no current security significance. (Applicant Exhibit M; Tr. 101-102.) Applicant stated that she was unintentionally exposed to marijuana in 2014 and 2015. She denies intentionally using it during the period of her employment. (Tr. 62-63.) In 2014 she attended an outdoor concert with friends. During this concert neighboring attendees shared food such as brownies and cookies. Applicant ate several of these items. After she consumed them one of the neighbors told her that the baked goods contained marijuana.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on August 9, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 48-year-old Labor Relations Staff employee with a defense \ncontractor. She has worked for the company since 2000. She is single. Applicant has \nreceived a bachelor of arts degree and a master\u2019s degree. She is seeking to retain a \nsecurity clearance granted in approximately 2006 in connection with her work with the \nDoD. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Applicant Exhibit E.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause she has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted both allegations under this \nparagraph with explanations. \nApplicant admitted that she used marijuana less than ten times in the 1990s. That \nuse is not alleged in the SOR and is in the distant past. This use has no current security \nsignificance. (Applicant Exhibit M; Tr. 101-102.) \nApplicant stated that she was unintentionally exposed to marijuana in 2014 and \n2015. She denies intentionally using it during the period of her employment. (Tr. 62-63.) \nIn 2014 she attended an outdoor concert with friends. During this concert \nneighboring attendees shared food such as brownies and cookies. Applicant ate several \nof these items. After she consumed them one of the neighbors told her that the baked \ngoods contained marijuana. Applicant testified that she did not know that before she ate \nthem, felt no affects from eating the food, and has no knowledge as to whether the person \nwas telling the truth. (Tr. 63-66, 107-108.) \nThe next time Applicant was exposed to marijuana was about a year later, in 2015, \nwhile on vacation with several other people. Some of these people were friends of \nApplicant, others were friends of her friends. Several of them, including Applicant, used \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvape pens. Applicant\u2019s used tobacco in hers. On one occasion Applicant picked up the \nwrong vape pen by accident. She took a puff and found that it had a strange flavor. She \nenquired and was told by the owner, a friend of a friend, that it contained marijuana. Once \nagain, Applicant did not feel any affects, and has no knowledge as to whether the person \nwas telling the truth. (Tr. 66-71.) \nSubsequent to these two incidents Applicant is much more careful about taking \nfood from strangers in concert-like situations. In addition, she has stopped using vape \npens altogether. (Tr. 66, 69, 71-73.) \nApplicant has repeatedly stated that these were her last \u201cuses\u201d of marijuana and \nthat she has no intent of using marijuana in the future. Even though Applicant does not \nbelieve she has or had a drug problem, she has taken several steps to assure the \nGovernment that she is being proactive in preventing a future problem. Applicant has \ntaken a course in drug and alcohol awareness, and also one in marijuana education. She \nhas taken several negative drug tests. (Applicant Exhibits J, L, N, and O; Tr. 72, 74.) \nApplicant received an evaluation dated December 20, 2021, from a psychologist. \nThe report covered the area of drug abuse. (Applicant Exhibit M.) He conducted a \nthorough examination of Applicant that included an interview, various psychological tests, \nand review of relevant documentation. The psychologist opined, \u201c[Applicant] does not now \nnor has she ever met criteria for a diagnosable substance-related disorder.\u201d (Applicant \nExhibit M at 6; Tr. 102-106.) \nApplicant has also submitted a signed statement of intent \u201cnot to use or be involved \nwith illegal drugs in the future.\u201d The statement also declared that Applicant understood \nthat such involvement \u201cmay be grounds for revocation or denial of national security \neligibility.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit K.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause she has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or \nunreliability. Applicant admitted both the allegations under this paragraph with \nexplanations. \n2.a. Applicant filled out an e-QIP in September 2015. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nSection 23 of the questionnaire asked Applicant about her drug use history. Specifically, \nApplicant was asked whether she had used controlled substances during the previous \nseven years. Applicant stated, \u201cNo.\u201d This was an incorrect answer to a relevant question \nabout Applicant\u2019s drug use history. \nApplicant stated that her reason for not disclosing the two incidents of marijuana \nuse in 2014 and 2015 was because she thought they were too minor and inconsequential \nto disclose. She specifically stated that she did not have an intent to deceive the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGovernment about this accidental use, that it was simply a mistake on her part. (Tr. 75-\n76, 89, 115-116.) \nApplicant began working closely with Mr. C, an investigator for her employer, in \nabout 2013. Mr. C testified that he communicates with Applicant on almost a daily basis. \nWhen Applicant began preparing to fill out her 2020 questionnaire, she asked Mr. C for \nhis advice in filling out the form. He advised her to not make her own decisions as to what \nthe Government felt was relevant or important. Rather, he advised her to be proactive in \ntelling the Government about incidents she did not think were important. (Tr. 24-36, 92.) \nApplicant filled out that second questionnaire in October 2020. (Government \nExhibit 1.) In answering the same question in Section 23 about her drug use over the past \nseven years Applicant stated, \u201cYes.\u201d This was based on the advice of Mr. C to be \ncompletely forthcoming no matter how minor she believed the information to be. She \nfurther indicated that the usage extended from 2014 to 2016, which was in error. Applicant \nwent on to explain, \u201cWhile out at events (concerts, celebrations) I have smoked and eaten \nedibles that contained marijuana that I did not know/ know contained marijuana.\u201d She \nfurther stated, \u201d\u2018I\u2019m estimating the times at less than 10 as I don\u2019t know how many times \nfor an exact number.\u201d Applicant stated that the number ten was used to include all of the \nbaked goods she ate at the 2014 concert, in an attempt to be completely forthcoming. \nThis was a more accurate statement of her use, though somewhat confusing. (Tr. 76-79, \n89, 94-98.) \nA Report of Investigation (ROI) was prepared by a government investigator based \non his notes from an interview with Applicant. The ROI stated, \u201cFrom 1/14 to 1/16, Subject \n[Applicant] smoked and ate marijuana at concerts, parties, someone\u2019s house, and at \ncamping trips for a total of 10 times.\u201d Applicant vehemently disagreed with the \ninvestigator\u2019s version of the interview. (Government Exhibit 5; Tr. 80-88, 109-112.) \nBased on the advice of Mr. C, Applicant also revealed a 1995 arrest for petty theft \nunder Section 22 of the same questionnaire. This arrest would not have been required \nunder the terms of the question, but Applicant put it down in an attempt to be completely \nforthcoming. \nApplicant stated that she has learned to \u201cpay attention to what\u2019s written on your \nSF-86.\u201d (Tr. 116-117.) \n2.b. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that the Applicant\u2019s drug use \nhistory, as set forth under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E. \nMitigation \nA good friend of Applicant\u2019s testified on her behalf. This person, Ms. M, is a Director \nof Human Resources for a division of Applicant\u2019s defense employer. The witness has \nhuman resources responsibility for 8,000 personnel in her division.

She is aware of the \nallegations in this case. The witness has known Applicant since elementary school and \nis the person who recruited Applicant for the company. The witness believes Applicant to \nbe completely honest, trustworthy, and of a stellar character. The witness gave the \nApplicant her highest recommendation. (Tr. 37-58.) \nThe witness Mr. C also submitted a statement on Applicant\u2019s behalf, in addition to \nhis testimony. He has known Applicant for ten years in a professional capacity as an \ninvestigator. Mr., C was apprised of the allegations in this case. He stated, \u201c[Applicant] \nhas a solid understanding and appreciation for classified work activities at [her employer], \nand has demonstrated her commitment to protecting National Security through her \npositive work ethic and actions.\u201d He also testified that she is honest with a high degree of \nintegrity. (Applicant Exhibit G at 10-12; Tr. 24-36.) \nAdditional letters of recommendation were submitted by coworkers and personal \nfriends. Each of them has known Applicant for over ten years. All of them have knowledge \nof the allegations in this case. They all state that Applicant is trustworthy and believable. \nThey find her to be a hard-working person of integrity and recommend her for a position \nof trust. (Applicant Exhibit G at pages 1-9, 13-15.) \nApplicant is viewed as a solid performer by her employer. She has repeatedly \nreceived recognition for her job performance. (Applicant Exhibits D, F, and P.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant accidentally used marijuana twice in 2014 and 2015, while she was \nemployed in the defense industry and held a security clearance. Both of the stated \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana and issued the Guidance to \u201cprovide \nclarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the \nimportance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was accidentally exposed to marijuana twice over seven years ago. The \nevidence is clear and convincing that her ingestion was not voluntary. This conduct was \nin the past and has not been repeated. Applicant thoroughly understands the \nconsequences of any future drug use or exposure, and has taken several steps to avoid \nit. She has submitted a signed statement of intent. Viewing her extremely minor marijuana \nuse in the context of the whole person, Applicant has mitigated the security significance \nof her past drug involvement. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted false material information about her drug use history on a \nGovernment personnel security questionnaire in 2015. Based on my analysis of the \nevidence I find that Applicant had no intent to falsify the document. Rather, she answered \nincorrectly due to her misunderstanding of the requirements of the form. The cited \ndisqualifying conditions minimally apply to the facts of this case. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are possibly applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s conduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant freely admitted that she made a mistake in deciding that her accidental \ndrug use did not need to be disclosed on her 2015 e-QIP because it was accidental. When \nfilling out the 2020 questionnaire Applicant was fully forthcoming about her accidental \ndrug involvement. She was also truthful with a Government investigator, even though she \ndisagreed with his version of the interview. Her voluntary admissions on the second e-\nQIP and during the interview were the only evidence the Government had to establish \nany drug use on her part, and alleviated any security significance of her prior falsification, \nintentional or not. This conduct was an aberration in judgment that will not be repeated. \nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of her accidental falsifications on a \nGovernment questionnaire in 2015. \nAs stated under Paragraph 1, above, Applicant\u2019s drug use was accidental and \ninfrequent, in the past, and she evinces a credible intent not to use marijuana in the future. \nShe has mitigated subparagraph 2.b. \nApplicant has mitigated both subparagraphs under this guideline. Paragraph 2 is \nfound for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated her \nminor drug use and the falsification, intentional or not, of her 2015 security clearance \napplication. Her recent forthright disclosures minimized or eliminated the potential for \npressure, coercion, or duress. Continuation or recurrence of similar conduct is unlikely. \nOverall, the record evidence does not create any doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

In his answer \nto the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b and denied all other \nallegations with explanation. His admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact. \nIn April 2019, a complaining witness (CW1) told investigators that Applicant had \ngrabbed her waist and attempted to kiss her without her consent in about June 2018. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, 3.a) She stated the following. While socializing at a bar with members \nof her new unit she met Applicant. When she went outside to smoke, Applicant followed \nher. He asked to kiss her, and she replied, \u201cno, we work together\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d He then \n\u201cgrabbed [her] around her waist and attempted to kiss her.\u201d (AE H; GE 2 at 2) She put her \nhands on his chest, pushed him away and he went back into the bar. She saw Applicant \naround the squadron afterward but \u201c[he] avoided her at all costs.\u201d (AE H) She disclosed \nthis incident and incidents with two other males in her unit to her supervisor while \ndiscussing reasons she wanted a transfer. (GE 2 at 2; AE H) After the hearing, Applicant \nsubmitted a more detailed summary of CW1\u2019s statement to investigators reflecting that \nshe had not intended to report the incidents with Applicant and the two other male \nsquadron members, and only wanted to better inform her supervisor why she thought \nchanging platforms was the right decision for her. (AE H) \nApplicant denied that he groped CW1, grabbed her around the waist, asked or \nattempted to kiss her, and did not recall any inappropriate physical contact or that CW1 \npushed him. (Answer: AE G at 10-12; Tr. 35, 55-56) He said it was \u201cpossible\u201d that they \nhugged at the end of the evening in a show of friendship but did not specifically recall \ndoing so. (Tr. 56) He confirmed that he first met CW1 on the evening in question. (Tr. 35, \n48-49, 51, 111) He said that they were out with a group of friends but were \u201cpretty much \njust conversing amongst ourselves, talking, chatting, as well as like, the group was with \nus but we were more chatting amongst ourselves.\u201d (Tr. 35, 53) He did not recall how many \ndrinks he consumed that evening but said he had been socially drinking over a period of \nseveral hours and probably drank several beers, and one or two cocktails. (Tr. 51-53) He \ntestified that when CW1 went outside to smoke he followed her because \u201c[he] figured \nwe\u2019d continue our conversation and also so she wouldn\u2019t have to be standing out there \nby herself.\u201d (Tr. 54) He testified that they went back inside the bar together, rejoined their \ncolleagues, and went their separate ways at the end of the evening. (Tr. 35, 56-57) He \nsaid that he and CW2 were in the same squadron for 10 months after the alleged incident \nwithout tension between them, and that they \u201chad different duties in the plane, but I\u2019m \nsure we flew together, deployed together and so on.\u201d (Tr. 57) He did not recall any social \ninteraction with her after the June 2018 evening in the bar. (Tr. 62-63) \nApplicant challenged the veracity of CW1\u2019s allegations, noting that she waited \nmore than nine months to report the alleged incident and did so in support of her request \nto be reassigned. (AE G at 10-12; Tr. 34-35, 55-56) He said that she also made \nuncorroborated allegations that an airman texted her an unsolicited picture of his genitalia \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand that another airman inappropriately touched her buttocks. (AE G at 11, 101-103; Tr. \n128-129) He submitted a November 2021 letter from Technical Sergeant (TSgt) H, who \nhad served with Applicant from 2015 to 2020 and had been his roommate from late 2016 \nto early 2020. TSgt H wrote that \u201cI am aware of the allegations made against [Applicant] \nand I believe them to be false in nature. I believe [Applicant] fell victim to someone who \naccused multiple other people of similar allegations and that [Applicant] told the whole \ntruth during his testimonies.\u201d (Answer at Ex. 9; AE G at 91-92; Tr. 35) Applicant said that \nhe was not questioned by investigators about CW1\u2019s allegations against him. (Tr. 58-63) \nCW1\u2019s allegations were investigated but were not included in the charges preferred \nagainst Applicant in October 2019 and later referred to general court-martial. (AE G at \n101-103; GE 2 at 1; Tr. 128-129)  \nIn May 2019, investigators interviewed CW2, and she said that Applicant groped \nand sexually assaulted her on March 1, 2019. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a, 3.a) She provided the \nfollowing account to investigators. Applicant asked if he could stay at her residence after \na night out and she agreed. While in a taxi enroute to her residence she vomited. She fell \nwhile exiting the vehicle at her residence, scraped her arm and dirtied her clothes. She \nwent to take a shower, and while removing her clothes, Applicant entered the bathroom \nnaked, grabbed her, and tried to pull her close. CW2 told him to stop, he then grabbed \nher buttocks, pushed her close to a counter and tried to kiss her, while fondling and kissing \nher breasts. She repeatedly told him to \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cno\u201d to which he replied, \u201c[y]ou know \nyou want [to engage in sexual activity with me].\u201d CW2\u2019s roommate [Roommate] came out \nof her room, encountered CW2 and Applicant, told him to leave and then escorted him \nout of the residence. Applicant then repeatedly knocked on the door, rang the doorbell \nand asked to come in to apologize. (GE 2 at 2) \nRoommate\u2019s statement to investigators is summarized as follows. In about March \n2019 she saw an intoxicated CW2 leaning on a male later identified as Applicant at the \nresidence she shared with CW2. She then helped CW2 to the shower. CW2 told her that \n\u201cI don\u2019t want [Applicant] here, we need to make him leave.\u201d Roommate thanked Applicant \nand asked him to leave, but he swiftly walked into the bathroom occupied by CW2 and \nlocked the door. Roommate heard CW2 say, \u201cHey I\u2019m naked, you need to get out.\u201d \nSeconds later the bathroom door opened, and Roommate saw CW2 attempting to cover \nher naked body with a towel. Applicant ran out of the bathroom nude, covering his penis \nwith his hands, and then hid behind a Christmas tree. CW2 appeared sick and ran into \nthe bathroom to vomit. Applicant swiftly followed her and locked the door. Roommate \nheard CW2 say, \u201cI\u2019m throwing up, don\u2019t touch me. Go home.\u201d Roommate then escorted \nApplicant from the bathroom and outside the residence. CW2 later told Roommate that \n\u201cshe never felt so close [to] being raped,\u201d and that Applicant had picked her up, placed \nher on the counter, and attempted to perform oral sex on her. (GE 2 at 2) \nApplicant denied any nonconsensual sexual behavior with CW2. He specifically \ndenied groping CW2, grabbing her buttocks, fondling or kissing her breasts, attempting \nto perform oral sex on her, telling her that \u201c[y]ou know you want [to engage in sexual \nactivity with me]. He also testified that CW2\u2019s statement to investigators was untruthful. \n(Answer; Tr. 76-78, 83-84) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant recounted the evening as follows.

She went to the bathroom alone after they entered \nher residence. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 73, 80) He met and spoke with Roommate for \nseveral minutes and decided to go home. (Tr. 78-80, 117) When he went to say goodbye \nto CW2, she opened the door naked and \u201cinvited [him] inside the bathroom [and] to join \nher in a shower\u201d. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 37, 78-81, 83) They then mutually kissed, \nand she helped him undress. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 75-77, 80-81, 83) CW2 suggested \nthat they go to her bedroom because she did not want Roommate to hear them or to \njudge her for engaging in sexual activity after her recent breakup. (Answer; AE G at 106; \nTr. 78-79) While naked and on their way to CW2\u2019s bedroom they encountered Roommate, \nwho scolded them both about their behavior, so he and CW2 returned to the bathroom to \nget their clothes. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 36-40, 82-83) Roommate told him it was a \ngood idea to leave, and he agreed because CW2 \u201cwas sick and obviously drunk\u201d.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that he was discharged from the U.S. Air Force under Other \nThan Honorable Conditions in lieu of trial by court-martial for charges preferred because \nof that misconduct. \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe record evidence including statements from CW1, CW2 and Roommate \nprovide substantial evidence that Applicant sexually assaulted and groped CW2, and that \nhe grabbed CW1 around the waist and attempted to kiss her without her consent. \nApplicant\u2019s admission and other record evidence establish that he was discharged from \nthe Air Force under other than honorable conditions in lieu of trial by court-martial. The \nrecord evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted, and  \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\"Honorable.\" \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \nApplicant presented no testimony or evidence that corroborated his denials of \nnonconsensual physical contact with CW1 and nonconsensual sexual contact with CW2. \nAnd he presented no evidence that rebutted or disputed the inculpatory assertions in \nstatements made by CW1, CW2, and Roommate. The evidence in support of his denials \nof any criminal conduct was limited to his testimony, support from his favorable character \nevidence, his military service, and TSgt H\u2019s opinion that the allegations were false. \nIt is undisputed that: (1) Applicant, CW1 and CW2 consumed a quantity of alcohol \nover a period of hours before the misconduct alleged in the SOR; (2) CW2 was visibly \nintoxicated, fell upon exiting a taxi at her residence and immediately went to her bathroom \nalone; (3) before Applicant entered CW2\u2019s bathroom he met and spoke with Roommate \nand decided to go home; (4) after he entered CW2\u2019s bathroom he kissed her and they \nwere both nude; (5) he then encountered Roommate again and she encouraged him to \nleave CW2\u2019s residence, which he did, and (6) that after he left CW2\u2019s residence he \napologized for his conduct. \nI do not find Applicant\u2019s claims that CW2 opened her bathroom door, invited him \nto join her in the shower, and then consensually engaged in sexual activity with him \ncredible. His claims are unsupported by other evidence and directly contradicted by \nCW2\u2019s and Roommate\u2019s statements. CW2, Applicant\u2019s close friend and colleague, \ndetailed his nonconsensual sexual misconduct. CW2\u2019s statement was corroborated, in \nlarge part, by Roommate, who also provided her own account of Applicant\u2019s and CW2\u2019s \nwords and actions. After Applicant entered CW2\u2019s bathroom, Roommate heard CW2 say \n\u201c[h]ey I\u2019m naked, you need to get out\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m throwing up, don\u2019t touch me. Go home.\u201d \n(GE 2 at 2) When the bathroom door opened, Roommate saw CW2 attempting to cover \nher naked body with a towel, saw Applicant, then nude, run out of the bathroom and \nattempt to hide, and subsequently escorted him from the residence. His assertions that \nCW2 may have falsely accused him of sexual misconduct because of her break-up and \nsubsequent reconciliation with a boyfriend, and concerns that her roommate would \nnegatively judge her for engaging in sexual activity with Applicant were neither \ncorroborated nor credible. Additionally, it is noteworthy that Applicant requested a \ndischarge in lieu of trial by court-martial on charges related to misconduct alleged by CW2 \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand Roommate, because he concluded, with advice of counsel, that the risk of conviction \nand punishment for those crimes was unacceptable. \nI also find CW1\u2019s rendition of events more credible than Applicant\u2019s. It is \nundisputed that: (1) CW1, then new to the squadron, first met Applicant the day of the \nalleged misconduct; (2) they both consumed alcoholic beverages and chatted collegially; \n(3) she left a bar to smoke and he, without invitation, followed her outside where they \nwere alone, and (4) that there is no evidence they socially interacted or even spoke again \nfor the next 10 months she was assigned to the same squadron. CW1 said that: (1) while \noutside the bar Applicant asked to kiss her and she twice told him no; (2) he then \u201cgrabbed \n[her] around her waist and attempted to kiss her;\u201d (3) she pushed him away and he went \nback inside the bar, and (4) that when she subsequently saw him around the squadron \n\u201c[he] avoided her at all costs.\u201d Applicant denied any physical contact with CW1, except \npossibly a friendly goodbye hug at the end a collegial evening and did not recount any \nconversations or recall any other social interaction with her though he was \u201csure [they] \nflew together, deployed together and so on.\u201d (Tr. 57, 62-63) His lack of recollection of \nprofessional or social interaction with CW1 in the 10-month period they served together \nafter first meeting and spending several hours in collegial conversation is less credible \nthan her claims that he inappropriately touched her outside the bar and avoided her \nthereafter. I gave little weight to TSgt H\u2019s opinions because he provided no evidentiary \nbasis for his belief that CW1 lied about the offense and because there is no evidence \nApplicant provided a statement or testimony regarding the misconduct alleged at any time \nbefore TSgt H\u2019s November 2021 letter.     \nAs discussed above, I did not find Applicant\u2019s denials that he committed the \nmisconduct alleged in the SOR credible. I found his testimony and demeanor at the \nhearing to be unconvincing and inconsistent with someone who was reliably telling the \ntruth. In addition to matters discussed above, his acknowledgement that both incidents \nrevolved around alcohol and that he had significantly modified his alcohol consumption \nand social behavior to avoid similar future situations was inconsistent with his denials and \nclaims that he was in full control of his own mental faculties during both alleged incidents. \nI found his minimization of visible manifestations of CW2\u2019s intoxication, fanciful rendition \nof their sexual interaction, and explanations for his attempts to apologize to her \nunconvincing. I also found his demeanor and answers to questions about his relationship \nand contact with CW1 after the alleged incident with her somewhat nonresponsive and \nevasive. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) are not fully established. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred \nmore than four years ago, his other than honorable discharge in lieu of trial by court-\nmartial from the Air Force was more than two years ago, and there have been no \nadditional incidents. The criminal conduct alleged in the SOR occurred after he had \nconsumed a substantial quantity of alcohol and he has since modified his alcohol \nconsumption and social behavior. However, his denials of misconduct lack credibility and \nare contradicted by statements from CW1, CW2 and Roommate, and uncorroborated by \nother reliable evidence. His failure to take any responsibility for his misconduct \u201cundercuts \na conclusion of reform and rehabilitation,\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-00331 at 7 (App. Bd.

His \ncriminal conduct, failure to acknowledge or accept responsibility for his misconduct, and \nrequest for discharge in lieu of trial by court-martial and other than honorable discharge \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is not established. Statements from CW1, CW2, and Roommate, \ncorroborated in part by Applicant, provided substantial, reliable evidence that he \ncommitted the criminal conduct alleged in the SOR. Notwithstanding his strong character \nevidence and combat record, Applicant\u2019s testimony was insufficient to overcome the \nevidence against him. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12, as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe record evidence including statements from CW1, CW2 and Roommate \nprovide substantial evidence that Applicant sexually assaulted and groped CW2, and that \nhe grabbed CW1 around the waist and attempted to kiss her without her consent. The \nrecord evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 13: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) is not fully established for the reasons set out in the above discussion \nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d). \nAG \u00b6 14(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s continued false denial of the sexual-\ncriminal conduct shows he is still vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. \nAG \u00b6 14(d) is not established because the sexual behavior alleged in the SOR was \nnonconsensual, not private, and not discreet. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. The record evidence \ndiscussed above potentially supports application of the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 16. \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . any disruptive, violent, or \nother inappropriate behavior . . . ; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nNeither AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) nor 16(d) apply because the evidence is \u201csufficient for an \nadverse determination\u201d under Guidelines J and D. AG \u00b6 16(e) applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (d) are not fully established for the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d). \nAG \u00b6 17(e) is not established by evidence and for the reasons set out in the \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32 (d), and AG \u00b6 14(c), above. Applicant\u2019s continued false \ndenial of the sexual-criminal conduct shows he is still vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere already addressed, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered the following factors: Applicant's military and federal contractor \nservice; he was a highly qualified and successful airman with an extraordinary combat \nrecord, and that he earned multiple awards and decorations including the Distinguished \nFlying Cross and numerous Air Medals; he has held a security clearance since 2010, \nwithout reported incident; his numerous and favorable letters of recommendation and \ncharacter references; and he has modified his alcohol consumption and taken steps to \nbetter control his environment. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Two servicemembers credibly \naccused Applicant of aggressive, nonconsensual sexual behavior that constituted \ncriminal conduct including the sexual assault of CW2, his clearly intoxicated close friend, \nafter he had consumed substantial amounts of alcohol. I considered that he requested a \ndischarge in lieu of trial by court-martial on criminal charges including the sexual assault \nof CW2, with knowledge of the evidence against him and because he concluded the risk \nof conviction and punishment was unacceptable to him. His request for discharge was \napproved by a general officer after consideration of the criminal investigation, \nrecommendations of Applicant\u2019s chain of command and a judge advocate. The general \nofficer directed that he be discharged from the U.S. Air Force under other than honorable \nconditions. As discussed above, I did not find Applicant\u2019s denials that he committed the \nmisconduct alleged in the SOR credible. Applicant has not accepted responsibility or \ndemonstrated remorse for his criminal misconduct but has instead accused his victims of \nlying about that misconduct. \nAfter \nweighing \nthe \napplicable \ndisqualifying \nand \nmitigating \nconditions \nunder Guidelines D, J, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal \nconduct, sexual behavior, and personal conduct. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

His home went into foreclosure. The \nlaw firm assured him a much-reduced settlement with the IRS and state(s) would be \nexpected. After seven years with little resolution, the law firm informed Applicant they \nwere unable to lower his delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties below $220,000. \nApplicant hired another tax defense law firm in November 2022. In his SOR response, \nhe stated that this law firm had reduced his taxes to $198,000, and they were working \nwith tax representatives for an offer in compromise and a structured payment plan. \nApplicant testified during the hearing that he currently owed $202,000 for delinquent \nfederal taxes based on the most recent information he received from the IRS. In \naddition, recent discussions projected that he would be paying $3,700 monthly in a tax \nrepayment plan, but the plan most likely would not be drafted until July 2023. (SOR \nresponse; Tr. 29-31) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant was asked why he allowed so many years to pass \nwithout his initial law firm making better progress in reaching a tax resolution. Applicant \nstated that as long as the law firm was in negotiation with the IRS, the IRS was not \nbothering him to collect money. He also admitted that he has not made any payments \non his delinquent federal taxes over the years, and he will not do so until an agreement \nis reached.

He testified that he sent the bank a letter \ninforming them that he would not acknowledge the debt since the bank initiated the \nforeclosure on his home. During the hearing he stated he understood that he is legally \nobligated for the second mortgage loan, but he does not feel morally obligated to pay \nthe debt because the bank failed to negotiate with him while he was unemployed. He \nalso believed the statute of limitations has run on this debt and it is no longer collectible. \nHe stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not paid and it\u2019s not going to be paid.\u201d (SOR response; Tr. 42-46) \nApplicant listed his tax issues on his March 2020 security clearance application \n(SCA). He testified that he has a monthly budget, and after paying all of his monthly \nexpenses, he has a monthly net remainder of about $6,000. Sometime soon, he \nexpects about $3,700 of his $6,000 monthly net remainder will be used to resolve his \ndelinquent federal taxes once the repayment agreement is in place. He intends to timely \nfile all of his income tax returns in the future. (Tr. 47; GE 1) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent charged-off second mortgage, \nsignificant outstanding federal and state tax debt, and his history of not timely filing his \nincome tax returns for multiple years establishes the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 19: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or \nactions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nEven where tax problems have been corrected and an applicant is motivated to \nprevent such problems in the future, the administrative judge is not precluded from \nconsidering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility.

See e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App Bd. Mar. 7, 2018)). In reversing favorable \nclearance grants to applicants who only begin to address their delinquent tax returns \nafter having been placed on notice that their clearance may be in jeopardy may not \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations when their immediate interests are not \nimperiled. Applicant was on notice when he completed his March 2020 SCA, and during \nhis April 2020 background interview. He was further prompted to provide proof of his tax \nfilings after interrogatories were issued to him, and after he submitted the requested \ndocumentation in July 2021. He has not provided evidence of any delinquent tax \npayments. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. He \nattributed his failure to pay taxes and timely file federal and state income tax returns for \nmultiple years was due to his self-employment business decline. He has failed to \nprovide supporting documentation to demonstrate his good-faith efforts to remedy this \nmatter that spans more than a decade, and even after he eventually had the financial \nresources to do so. He admitted his federal tax debt totals $202,000. He has not made \npayments to the IRS over the years because a repayment agreement is not yet in place. \nApplicant failed to take responsible action to resolve his unfiled federal and state \nincome tax returns and pay his tax delinquency for multiple years. He has refused to \npay his second mortgage, although he admits he is legally responsible, because of \npersonal reasons. Access to classified and protected information requires faithful \nadherence to the rules and regulations governing such activity. A person who fails to \naddress concerns, even after having been placed on notice that his or her access or \nsecurity clearance is in jeopardy, may lack the willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his or her personal interests are at stake. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, and other issues that hampered his \nability to pay his federal and state taxes. However, his lack of priority in handling his tax \nissues over a multi-year period causes me to question his trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment, and thus, his eligibility for access to classified information. While \nApplicant expressed a sincere intention to file his tax returns on time in the future, and \nhis promise to pay his delinquent taxes once a repayment plan is drafted, it does not \ncarry as much weight in reform as if he had been able to show a long track record of \ncompliance with his tax-filing obligations, or good-faith payments on his delinquent tax \ndebt. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Following his discharge, he worked as a civilian for the Army, then for the U.S. Navy, and at a later date for the Veterans Administration (VA). He was not earning enough money to support his family so he decided to pursue an education. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in October 2017 and a master\u2019s degree in September 2019. Applicant was unemployed from 2014 to 2019 while he was attending college and pursuing his post-graduate degree. He paid for his education with benefits from the VA. His benefits terminated upon his graduation. After receiving his master\u2019s degree, he was unemployed for an extended period due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. He began working in his current position with a Government contractor in October 2020. He is seeking eligibility for a public trust position in connection with his employment.

He is engaged to \nremarry. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1996 and served as a paramedic. He was \nhonorably discharged in 2005 due to a disability. Following his discharge, he worked as \na civilian for the Army, then for the U.S. Navy, and at a later date for the Veterans \nAdministration (VA). He was not earning enough money to support his family so he \ndecided to pursue an education. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in October 2017 and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in September 2019.

(Answer at 1; Tr. at 15, 24-31; GE 1 at 10-15, 19-20, 22, 24-25.) \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor clearance because he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore \npotentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. The SOR sets forth 12 allegations, 10 of which are for debts totaling \napproximately $72,000. In the Answer, he admitted 11 of the 12 allegations in the SOR \nand denied one debt for $3,594 (SOR 1.f).

Applicant opened this \nunsecured loan account in March 2017 and defaulted on the account in about October \n2019. In March 2022 Applicant entered into a payment plan with the attorney for the \ncreditor. Under the plan, he agreed to pay $150 per month. He provided a document \nevidencing the agreed-upon plan, and he is current on his payments. This debt is being \nresolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 32-40; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 8; AE I.) \n1.b. Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $21,234. Applicant opened this \nloan account in July 2018 to pay off some debt that accrued during the years he attended \ncollege. He defaulted on the account in about January 2019. Applicant has since made \npayment arrangements with the creditor and is repaying the loan. Since April 15, 2022, \nhe has made payments of $50 per month. When other debts have been paid off by the \nend of 2022, he expects to increase his monthly payment on this debt. He provided a \nletter from the creditor confirming that this debt is under a payment plan. This debt is \nbeing resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 40-42; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 8; AE J.) \n1.c Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $5,280. Applicant opened this \ncredit-card account in June 2015 with the same creditor as the debt alleged in SOR 1.a. \nApplicant defaulted on paying this account in about May 2019. He negotiated a settlement \nof this account with the creditor. He understands that the settlement covers the loan \naccount in SOR 1.a and this credit-card account, which are both owed to the same \ncreditor. This debt is being resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 42-46; GE 2 at 10; GE 3 at 2; \nGE 4 at 9; AE I.) \n1.d Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $4,993. This is a credit-\ncard account that Applicant was unable to pay after the completion of his master\u2019s \nprogram in 2019. Applicant negotiated a settlement of this account. He credibly testified \nthat since March 2022 he has been making payments of $50 per month pursuant to an \nagreed-upon payment plan. He has been unable to obtain a confirming letter from the \ncollection agency handling this settlement. This debt is being resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. \nat 46-47; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 9, 10.) \n1.e Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $3,822. Applicant \ndefaulted on this credit-card account in 2019. He has reached a settlement with the \ncollection agency and has been making payments of $100 per month since February \n2022. Under the payment plan, his last payment is due in April 2025. Applicant provided \na letter from the collection agency confirming the terms of the settlement. This debt is \nbeing resolved.

Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $3,121. Applicant opened this \ncredit-card account in January 2019 and defaulted on paying the account in about July \n2019. He reached a settlement with the creditor and paid the amount of $468 in full \nsatisfaction of this debt. The Government\u2019s August 2022 credit report in the record (GE \n2) reflects that this debt has been paid.  This debt has been resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. \nat 57-59; GE 2 at 11; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 10.) \n1.h. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $674. Applicant has \nreached a settlement of this account and is making payments pursuant to a payment plan. \nUnder the settlement, he is paying $108 per month by automatic withdrawals from his \nbank account. All payments under this payment plan were scheduled to have been \ncompleted by October 2022. As of the hearing date, Applicant believes that he has fully \npaid this debt. This debt has been resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 63-65; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 \nat 3; AE M.) \n1.i. Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $352. Applicant paid this credit-\ncard debt in full in February 2022 and provided substantiating documentation. This debt \nhas been resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 65-66; GE 4 at 10; AE K; AE L.) \n1.j. Failure to timely file Federal tax returns for Tax Years (TYs) 2016, 2017, 2018, \nand 2019. Applicant was a full-time student during the years when he failed to file Federal \nreturns. He had no income to report to the IRS, though he did receive VA education \nbenefits, specifically benefits under the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment \nProgram, which he received as a disabled veteran. Applicant\u2019s VA education counselor \nadvised him that these benefits are not taxable. Other tax advisors have told him the \nsame thing. Applicant never received a tax document from the VA indicating that the \nbenefits he received were taxable or that the VA reported the benefits to the IRS as \nincome. I provided Department Counsel with the opportunity to supplement the record if \nthe Government concluded that Applicant\u2019s VA benefits were taxable under U.S. tax law \nand therefore he failed to report the benefits as taxable income by filing tax returns. \nDepartment Counsel timely responded after the hearing and declined to submit any \nadditional documentation or information in support of its allegations in SOR 1.j and 1.k. \nAccordingly, the record evidence supports the conclusion that Applicant was not obligated \nto file tax returns during the period TYs 2016 through 2019 because he had no taxable \nincome. Since Applicant began his current employment in 2020, he has filed his returns \nfor TYs 2020 and 2021. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 67-73; GE 6.) \n1.k.

(Answer at 3; Tr. at 73.) \n1.l. Child-support arrearage in the approximate amount of $4,000. Applicant \nbecame delinquent on his child-support obligations for a child he had with a woman other \nthan his ex-wife or his fianc\u00e9e. This child is now six years old. Applicant is presently \nmaking monthly payments of $350 or more to the state to pay his child support and the \narrearage. He credibly testified that he is making this payment every month. As of the \ndate of the Answer, March 29, 2022, Applicant had reduced the arrearage to $879. He \nreferenced in his Answer a letter evidencing the reduced debt amount, but he failed to \nsubmit it with his Answer. I left the record open for one week to give Applicant the \nopportunity to supplement the record, if he chose to do so. He made no further \nsubmission. This debt is being resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 73-78.) \nMitigation and Whole-Person Evidence \nApplicant submitted 11 character-reference letters. They all praised Applicant as a \nhard-working employee who was proud of his many years of service to the U.S \nGovernment in the Army, as a civilian employee, and now as a contractor. They have \nconfidence that Applicant will continue to resolve his financial obligations. (AE A through \nH, P.) \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases \nforwarded to the DoD and DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel \nManagement. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures \ncontained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be \nmade. \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance, or, as here, to \na determination of public trust. As the Supreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \n[and trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance [or trustworthiness] \ndecision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n \n \n (c)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe evidence does not establish that he failed to file any Federal or state tax \nreturns, as required, because he had no taxable income during the four years in question. \nAG \u00b6 19(f) is not established. The record evidence, however, establishes that Applicant \nhad nine consumer debts and a child-support arrearage as of the date of the SOR. These \nfacts support the conclusion that AG \u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. This shifts the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by these delinquent debts. \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nthat problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe circumstances that gave rise to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were \nunusual and are unlikely to recur. Applicant graduated with a master\u2019s degree and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlost his VA benefits for vocational retraining at the same time. Shortly thereafter, \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and national shutdown occurred rendering employment \nopportunities scarce. His lengthy period of unemployment with no unemployment \ninsurance left Applicant with no income and no ability to support himself and his \nfamily, let alone pay his debts. These circumstances were beyond his control and \ndo not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Moreover, \nhe acted responsibly once his current employer hired him by contacting his \ncreditors, paying debts when he could do so, and negotiating payment plans to \nresolve his larger debts. Applicant did not receive financial counseling, but there \nare clear indications that his debts are being resolved. Starting in February 2022, \nApplicant initiated a good-faith effort to pay the debts he could afford to pay and to \ncontact his other creditors to arrange settlements and payments plans to repay his \nlarger debts. He disputes one debt because the creditor has an incorrect address \nand he does not have any recollection of the debt. He has a legitimate basis to \ndispute the debt, but if the creditor documents that this is Applicant\u2019s obligation, he \nintends to repay it. All of the above mitigating conditions have full or partial \napplication to the facts of this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nI have weighed Applicant\u2019s nine years of service in the Army and his service-related \ndisability. I have also weighed his other service working as a civilian for the Army, the \nNavy, and the VA and now his service to the U.S. military as a contractor. Applicant\u2019s \nefforts to resolve his delinquent debts are impressive, and he has exhibited his \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness and reliability by his actions. His multiple character references endorse \nApplicant for his trustworthiness and reliability. Overall, the evidence does not raise any \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a position of \npublic trust. Applicant has met his burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising \nunder the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion  \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted some of the Guideline G allegations in the SOR and denied others. He failed to either admit or deny the Guideline J allegations. Since the underlying allegations are the same under both Guidelines, he is deemed to have admitted and denied the same allegations under Guideline J as he did for Guideline G. He admitted the Guideline B allegation, with explanations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the testimony, pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 63 years old. He is divorced and has two adult children. He is currently employed by a government contractor. He has worked for different government or defense contractors as a power plant technician on various contracts over the years, dating back to 2010. Many of these contracts required his presence in combat zones, such as Iraq and Afghanistan. He was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps after serving from 1979 to 1985. He has three associate\u2019s degrees. He held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps and at various times while serving as a government-contractor employee.

(Tr. 72-76; GE 3 (p 12); SOR Answer; AE B, E) \nApplicant listed in his 2020 security clearance application (SCA) attending court-\nordered alcohol counseling in 1990 and 2001, but he did not supply any documentation \nabout either program or detail what was involved with these programs, in terms of \ndiagnoses, prognoses, or treatment plans. (GE 1) \nApplicant testified that he does not consider himself an alcoholic, rather he is \n\u201cjust a person that had bad luck.\u201d He claims to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) about \nonce a month, but he admitted that he does not have sponsor, nor does he work the AA \n12-step program recommended for recovering alcoholics. He also claims he has no \nfurther interest in consuming alcohol. As an example, he cited that he recently attended \na family gathering where alcohol was present, but he did not consume any. (Tr. 78-81, \n90) \nThe Guideline B allegation concerns Applicant\u2019s relationship with a woman who \nis a citizen and resident of Ethiopia. He admitted having a relationship with this woman \nand providing her financial support. He was in contact with her from approximately 2017 \nto 2019. He met her when he was in Ethiopia, and she was a receptionist at a hotel. \nFrom 2017 to 2019, he provided her with approximately $1,000 per month to help her \nand her family. During this time, he was in contact with her on a weekly basis. He visited \nher in Ethiopia on several occasions. The last time he was in Ethiopia was in 2019. He \nended his relationship with this woman in approximately June 2019, when he came \nback to the United States after his job in Southwest Asia ended. The last contact with \nher was in June 2019. The last financial support he provided was in August 2019. He \nhas no intentions of contacting her, seeing her, or providing any additional financial \nassistance to her in the future. (Tr. 81-88) \nApplicant presented six character letters from friends and colleagues. They \ndescribe Applicant as responsible and someone who is dedicated, hard-working, and \nwho has high character. Several recommend continuation of his security clearance. \nApplicant also presented several awards, certificates, and pictures demonstrating his \nservice to the country over the years.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s five DWI arrests and his description of his drinking habits support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nI have also considered all the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption under \nAG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s last adverse alcohol incident occurred in April 2019. This might be \nconsidered attenuated by time, but for his four earlier DWI arrests and convictions in \n1986, 1989, 1993 and 2002. He claims he has stopped drinking alcohol since his 2019 \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \narrest, however, his history of continued drinking and driving suggest that is unlikely. His \nactions cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n23(a) does not apply. \nApplicant denies that he is an alcoholic, rather he believes he just has bad luck. \nHis claim of abstinence, without corroboration, or evidence of treatment success, is not \ncredible. AG \u00b6 23(b) does not apply. \nOther than self-reported sporadic attendance at AA meetings, Applicant failed to \ndocument the completion of any treatment plans. In his SCA, Applicant claimed \nparticipation in court-ordered alcohol treatment programs, although there is no \ndocumentation of these programs and no details of what these programs entailed. \nFurthermore, his repeated alcohol-related incidents after such treatment indicated he \nhas not successfully addressed his problem. AG \u00b6 23(d) does not apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nApplicant\u2019s five DWIs constitute a pattern of criminal conduct. I find that both \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nI have also considered all the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nConcerning these mitigating conditions, see the earlier discussion regarding AG \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b) and 23(d). Additionally, Applicant does not acknowledge his alcohol \nproblems, which is the first step toward rehabilitation. He did successfully complete his \nlatest sentence of probation and has a good employment record. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not \napply, but AG \u00b6 32(d) has some application. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe relationship between Ethiopia and the United States places a significant, but \nnot insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationship with his girlfriend living in Ethiopia does not pose a security risk. Applicant \nshould not be placed in a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty \nto the United States and a desire to assist his girlfriend living in Ethiopia who might be \ncoerced by governmental entities or pressured to assist Ethiopia. \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Ethiopia seek or \nhave sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant, or his \ngirlfriend living in Ethiopia, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) applies based upon Applicant\u2019s girlfriend who is a resident and citizen of \nEthiopia. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant credibly testified that although he formerly had a relationship with his \nEthiopian girlfriend from approximately 2017 to August 2019, that relationship ended in \n2019, and he has had no further contact with her since that time. Moreover, he stated \nthat he does not intend to contact her or provide her financial support in the future. AG \u00b6 \n8(c) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice, his contractor service in combat areas, his letters of recommendation, and his \nawards and certificates. However, I also considered that he has not come to grips with \nhis alcohol issues. He continues to deny having alcohol problems even though it has \nresulted in five different DWI charges against him over the course of more than 30 \nyears. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol consumption \nand criminal conduct security concerns. He ended his relationship with his Ethiopian \ngirlfriend in 2019 and has had no further contact with her. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines G and J, \nbut he mitigated the concerns under Guideline B. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1,b, 1.d, 1.g-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1,e, 1.f: \nWithdrawn \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant (except \nas 2.a refers to the withdrawn allegations stated in 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f) \nParagraph 3, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   3.a:  \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He served on active duty in the U.S. military from \n2000 until he was honorably discharged in December 2014. He seeks to retain a \nsecurity clearance, which he has held since about 2018. He has college credits, but he \nhas not earned a degree. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2012. He married again in \n2012 and divorced in 2016. He married for the third time in 2018. He is separated, \npending a divorce. He has two children, ages 19 and 17, and three teenage \nstepchildren.

The debts are \nlisted on a November 2020 credit report, a June 2021 credit report, or both credit \nreports. The debts include a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.a - $11,342), the deficiency owed on \nan auto loan after the vehicle was repossessed (1.b - $12,737), child support \narrearages (1.c - $10,608), payday loans (1.e - $3,371 and 1.i - $1,514), eight medical \ndebts totaling $2,527 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.r), and five miscellaneous debts totaling $6,285 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j) \nApplicant made multiple deployments while he was in the military, and he was \nstationed in a foreign country from 2009 to 2012.

He was unemployed until he started his current job in late May 2021. His \nprior job required him to periodically work overseas. He worked in Afghanistan from \nFebruary 2020 through January 2021. When he was not overseas, he spent a lot of time \naway from home for work. He asserted that most of the SOR debts accumulated when \nhe was overseas or working in the United States away from home, and his wife was in \ncharge of handling the finances. He gave her a power of attorney. He did not find out \nuntil he returned from Afghanistan that she did not pay all of their bills, his vehicle was \nrepossessed, and she opened accounts without his knowledge. (Tr. at 14, 22-23, 41; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE C) \nApplicant contracted with a debt-settlement company in about November 2021 to \nassist him in resolving his debts.

(Tr. at 38, 47; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; AE A-C) \nApplicant agreed to make $282 payments every two weeks to an escrow \naccount. The debt-settlement company agreed to negotiate settlements with his \ncreditors and use the accumulated funds in the escrow account, minus their fees, to pay \nthe settlements. The company estimated a payoff amount of $27,045, with an estimated \ndebt-free date of August 2025. As of the last statement in September 2022, Applicant \nhad deposited $5,027 into the DRP, and the balance in the escrow account was $448. \n(Tr. at 47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A-C) \nThe debt alleged in 1.h ($1,079) has been settled for $541 and paid. The debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($11,342), 1.d ($1,062), and 1.f ($2,621) have been settled, and \npayments are being made to those creditors. The DRP statement shows a total of $220 \npaid to those three creditors. Based upon the $5,027 Applicant paid into the DRP, \npayments to creditors totaling $761, and the balance of $448, it appears the debt \nsettlement company takes their settlement fees before paying the creditors. (AE A, B) \nThe $11,342 delinquent credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was listed on a \nMarch 2018 credit report as current with a $14,593 balance. It was listed on the \nFebruary 2020 credit report as charged off with a $14,392 balance. The June 2021 \ncredit report listed that the debt was charged off for $15,216, with the first delinquency \nin May 2018. A payment of $150 was made in April 2021, and the balance was $11,342. \nApplicant stated that he was paying this debt outside the DRP. The DRP reported the \nbalance of the debt when it was settled was $10,642. Applicant\u2019s statement that he was \npaying this debt is accepted because the balance went down on the credit reports. The \ndebt has been settled through the DRP for $6,831, which includes the settlement \namount and the debt settlement company\u2019s fees. The documents do not include a \nbreakdown of the settlement amount and the fees. It is unclear how much has been \npaid to the debt settlement company, but only $50 has been paid to the creditor. (Tr. at \n35-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A-C) \nApplicant bought a vehicle in about November 2017 and financed it with a loan of \nmore than $33,000, through 72 monthly payments of $761.

It was listed on the February 2020 \nand June 2021 credit reports as charged off with a $12,737 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.b).

It is \nreported on the two later credit reports with a balance of $1,062. The date a major \ndelinquency was first reported was August 2018. Applicant stated that the account was \nup to date and deactivated before he left for Afghanistan. His wife activated the account, \nmade purchases, and then did not pay the account. He acknowledged at the hearing \nthat he could have been mistaken about when the debt became delinquent. The debt \nhas been settled through the DRP for $724, which includes fees.

(Tr. at 38-39; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A, B) \nApplicant asserted that his wife used the power of attorney to take out the \npayday loans (1.e - $3,371 and 1.l - $1,514). However, credit reports indicate the \n$3,371 debt was opened in August 2018 and the $1,514 debt was opened in November \n2019. At the hearing he clarified that he gave his wife a power of attorney in 2018, and \nhis wife opened the accounts without his knowledge while he was working on \nassignment away from home. He testified that both debts are in the DRP. The $3,371 \ndebt is in the DRP, but the $1,514 debt is not. He stated that the company does not list \nthe debt until it begins negotiations with the creditor. That statement does not appear to \nbe accurate.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his estranged wife\u2019s actions, and to \na lesser extent, his 2016 divorce. He apparently had similar issues with his first wife \nwhile he was stationed overseas. He stated that his child support arrearages resulted \nwhen his employer stopped the deductions from his pay. \nApplicant contracted with a debt-settlement company in about November 2021 to \nassist him in resolving his debts. He enrolled 13 debts, totaling $45,890, in the DRP, \nincluding nine SOR debts and four debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He agreed \nto make $282 payments every two weeks. As of September 2022, he had deposited \n$5,027 into the DRP, and the balance in the DRP was $448, which means that $4,579 \nwas paid to the debt-settlement company and his creditors, with most of it going to the \ndebt-settlement company. \nThe debt alleged in 1.h ($1,079) has been settled for $541 and paid. That debt is \nmitigated. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($11,342), 1.d ($1,062), and 1.f ($2,621) \nhave been settled, and payments are being made to those creditors. The DRP \nstatement shows a total of $220 paid to those three creditors. The DRP may eventually \nwork out for Applicant, but there is still a long way to go. He stated that his child support \narrearages have been paid, but he provided no documentation. The Appeal Board has \nheld that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). \nApplicant indicated that he planned to continue with the DRP and pay all of the \ndebts. Intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a \ntrack record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. \n11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). The medical debts have minimal security \nsignificance, and they are mitigated. However, two non-medical SOR debts are not \nincluded in the DRP, and there are four debts totaling $11,274 in the DRP that were not \nalleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d There is \ninsufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be \nresolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions, individually or \ncollectively, are insufficient to eliminate concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.r: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

She has never been married and has no children. She \nattended some college classes in about 2015. She has worked in shipbuilding for a \ndefense contractor for about four years. (Tr. 16-18; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $20,433, including $5,482 of student \nloans in collection, $304 of medical debt in collection, and $14,647 for a charged-off auto \nloan. The status of the allegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are student loans in collection for $3,365 and $2,117, \nrespectively. Applicant reported that she attended some college classes in about 2015. \nShe stated that after she completed these classes, she never made any payments on her \nstudent loans, and admitted she has no plans to make any payments. These loans are \nunresolved. (Tr. 23-31; GE 2, 3) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e are medical debts placed for collection for $169, $69, and $66, \nrespectively. Applicant stated that these debts were either copays or deductibles. She \nasserted that she would consider paying the two small debts but has not taken any action \non them. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 24-24; GE 2, 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is an auto loan that was charged off for $14,647. Applicant stated that \nin about 2015, she co-signed a loan for a new car for her sister. Her sister made payments \nfor a few months, but then stopped and the car was repossessed. She reported that she \nhas no idea what ultimately happened to the car. She stated that she has not taken any \naction to resolve this debt and has no plans to pay it. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 25, 28-\n29, 36; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant has not had any credit counseling and did not submit a budget. She \nclaimed that she brings home about $3,200 monthly and has about $2,000 in monthly \nexpenses. She reported that in early 2021, she got a random text message from a \ncompany offering to assist her with \u201cupdating her credit.\u201d She first thought it was a scam, \nbut looked up the company on the internet. She paid them about $1,000 over seven \nmonths to look at her debt and \u201cupdate her credit.\u201d They did not make any debt payments \non her behalf. She reported that she is not sure what they did for her and did not ask a \nlot of questions. She stated that she wants to purchase a home, so she hoped this service \nwould make it easier for her to get a mortgage.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the alleged debts are resolved, or that any became delinquent under \nsuch circumstances that are unlikely to recur. Her failure to pay delinquent and charged-\noff debt is both long-term and recent, as well as ongoing and unresolved. This continues \nto cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing that her debts occurred \nlargely due to circumstances beyond her control or that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. She did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline F arising out of her delinquent and \ncharged-off debts. This decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for eligibility for access to \nclassified information in the future.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant  \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

(GE \n2 at 5; Tr. 37-38) \nApplicant\u2019s oldest son is 34 years old and was born in the United States. As \nwith his three siblings, he is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel. Neither \nApplicant\u2019s wife nor his children are affiliated with the Israeli government or military. The \noldest son was discharged from mandatory service in the IDF because of a personal \nproblem. He is single and currently employed in Israel as a security guard. He lives in \nApplicant\u2019s Israeli home.

He \nfinished his mandatory military service, but the government could call him back at any \ntime. Recently graduated from college, he is currently a software engineer. He lives in \nanother location in Israel with a friend. Applicant has contact with him once a week. (GE \n1 at 23; GE 2 at 5; Tr. 35-36) \nApplicant\u2019s daughter was born in Israel. She completed her mandatory service \nin the IDF and is currently enrolled in an Israeli college. She is subject to recall, but the \ngovernment usually does not recall females.

(GE 1 at 23; \nGE 2 at 5-6; Tr. 36-37, 44) Though the record does not indicate the frequency of contact \nthat Applicant has with his daughter, I find his contact with her is the same as with his \nyoungest son. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Applicant\u2019s one brother and five sisters are citizens and residents \nof Israel. His brother, a retired major in the IDF, has been a high school teacher in Israel \nsince 2011. He is paid by the Israeli government.

Applicant will receive about $500 a \nmonth in retirement from his employment at a U.S. telecommunications company. At a \npoint in his career, he interacted with several professional colleagues, but currently he \nmaintains close contact with one professional peer, and a coworker who has had him \nover for holiday meals. (Tr. 45-48, 56-59) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i \u2013 Applicant had a girlfriend, a U.S. citizen, who is originally from \nRussia and is currently a resident of Russia. She married a U.S. citizen and lived for a \ntime in the United States. After her husband passed away, she returned to Russia. She \nsupports herself with U.S. Social Security benefits. Applicant did not disclose his travel \nto Russia in his June 2018 e-QIP even though the dates of travel to the country appear \nin his passport. He did not report the travel because he did not think he was required to. \nHe began this relationship online in 2014. Between 2014 and 2016, he traveled to \nRussia on four occasions and stayed four to eight days. The former girlfriend visited him \noccasionally. In his testimony, Applicant initially indicated that the relationship ended in \n2017. Later he testified that the affair ended in 2020 when he and his wife reconciled. \nBetween January 2017 and January 2019, he was spending about $300 a month for \neducational expenses of his former girlfriend\u2019s son. At the March 2023 hearing, he \ntestified that he stopped paying the child\u2019s expenses. Applicant\u2019s last contact with his \nformer girlfriend was a month before the hearing. At that time, he provided $1,700 in \nfinancial support in 2023 and $1,000 in 2022. The money transfers were to help her \nrepay loans. Applicant does not intend to provide financial support to her in the future. \n(GE 2 at 8-9; Tr. 25, 49-55) No additional information was provided. \nApplicant traveled to Israel regularly before the COVID-19 pandemic.

(GE 2 at 12; Tr. 48-49) \nApplicant has voted in Israeli elections in 2012, 2015, and once since. \nWhenever he is in the country, he votes because he is an Israeli citizen. He also \nexercises his Israeli citizenship by using the country\u2019s social medical system. When he \nretires, he wants to maintain his house in the United States and allocate significant time \nwith his children in Israel. He considers his allegiance to both Israel and the United \nStates.

The 120-member \nKnesset has the power to dissolve itself and require elections. \nIsrael is a close ally and trading partner of the United States. The country has a \nverified history of targeting U.S. classified information. The Department of State Travel \nAdvisory for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, is at level 4: Do not travel. The advisory \nis based on COVID-19, terrorism, and civil unrest. One additional reason for not \ntraveling to Gaza is civil conflict. The Israeli government considers U.S. citizens who \nalso have Israeli citizenship to be Israeli citizens for Immigration and other legal \nreasons. \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 The Russian Federation \nRussia is a substantially centralized, authoritarian political system closely \ncontrolled by Vladimir Putin. Though the United States and Russia were once allies, \ntheir current relationship is antagonistic. In August 2017, the U.S. president imposed \nsanctions against Russia for interference in the 2016 U.S. elections and their \naggression towards Ukraine. After Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the \nU.S. president imposed additional sanctions. In October 2020, the U.S. Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS) indicated that that Russian state-affiliated actors have \ncontinued to target all levels of the U.S. Government through cyber espionage. The \npurpose of this activity is to retrieve economic, policy, and national security information. \nThe U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory has issued a warning not to travel in \nRussia because of the limited ability to protect U.S. citizens in the country, COVID-19 \nrestrictions, terrorism, harassment by government security, and arbitrary enforcement of \nlocal laws. \nThe Department State 2020 Human Rights Report described significant human \nrights violations including: extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, pervasive \ntorture by government authorities, serious restrictions on religious freedom, restrictions \non individuals trying to change government through free and fair elections; and violent \ncrimes against persons with disabilities, members of ethnic minorities, and lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, and intersex persons. \n5 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment \nof foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \n6 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology;  \n(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do \nnot automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a)and 7(f), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation. Under AG \u00b6 7(b), connections are only disqualifying if they \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s security duties and his desire \nto assist his foreign family members. As the guideline indicates, the country in question \nmust be considered to determine whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified information or is associated with the risk of terrorism. AG \u00b6 7(c) also applies \nbased on Applicant\u2019s failure to reveal travels to Russia and his former Russian \ngirlfriend\u2019s identity on his June 2018 e-QIP. \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to his to his wife, four children who are dual citizens of \nthe Unites States and Israel and residents of Israel, his six siblings and a former \nbusiness partner who are citizens and residents of Israel, together with Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial interest in the country, are sufficient to establish a heightened risk in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(f), and also potential for a conflict of interest as described in AG \u00b6 7(b). \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould no be used effectively to influence, manipulate or pressure the \nindividual.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(f) are not established. Applicant\u2019s wife and four children are \ndual citizens of the United States and Israel, and residents of Israel. Though Applicant\u2019s \nmandatory military service in the IDF ended over 41 years ago, his four children have \nhad recent military service in the IDF, and at least two are subject to recall in the \nReserves. Six siblings and a former business partner are citizens and residents of \nIsrael. Applicant maintains regular contact with them and has traveled to Israel \nfrequently to visit them. He operated an Israeli company from 2008 to 2018. Applicant\u2019s \nIsraeli home and bank account total more than $1,200,000, an amount that is close to \nthe value of his U.S. home and retirement account, and therefore not insignificant. In \nsum, with Israel\u2019s record of industrial espionage against the United States, I cannot \nconclude that it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween an Israeli interest or entity and the interests of the United States. Though there \nis no evidence that the Israeli government seeks to exploit financial assets of its \ncitizens, Applicant\u2019s interest in the Israeli house used by Applicant and other family \nmembers could create the potential for a conflict of interest. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s sense of obligation to his foreign \nfamily members is not minimal. He admitted that he has allegiance to both the U.S. and \nIsrael. I am unable to conclude that Applicant could be expected to resolve any conflict \nin favor of the U.S. interest. \nApplicant should have disclosed his relationship with the former Russian \ngirlfriend on his June 2018 e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s testimony claiming that the relationship \nending in 2020, is not persuasive in light of the $1,700 he transferred to her shortly \nbefore the security clearance hearing, and his regular monthly payments of her son\u2019s \neducational expenses between 2017 and at least 2019. Applicant has not satisfied AG \u00b6 \n8(c) because his relationship with his former girlfriend, which is neither casual nor \ninfrequent, could create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence guideline in the \ncontext of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant entered the United States in 1980. He earned a master\u2019s degree in \nMarch 1984. He has been married to his present wife since November 1986, the same \nmonth that he became a U.S. citizen. He has been working for his present employer \nsince June 2018. \nApplicant indicated unequivocally that when he retires he would like to live in \nthe United States part of the year and in Israel for part of the year. His divided \nallegiances prevent a finding that he can be expected to resolve all conflict of interests \nin favor of the United States. Considering the evidence from an overall commonsense \npoint of view, Applicant has not met his burden of mitigating the security concerns \nbased on the foreign influence guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nnot clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since April of 2020. Applicant is married, and has \nno children. (TR at page 14 line 14 to page 17 line 13, and GX 1 at pages 7, 15 and \n22~23.) \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct, Guideline D - Sexual Behavior, & Guideline E - \nPersonal Conduct \n1.a., 2.a. and 3.a. In about October of 2017, more than five years ago while on \nactive duty with the Marine Corps, Applicant attempted to record and take photos of a \nfemale sailor, while she was changing her clothes in a changing room. This attempt was \ndone without her knowledge or consent. (TR at page 18 line 2 to page 29 line 17, at \npage 35 lines 19~23, and at page 37 lines 14~22.) As a result, Applicant was convicted \nat a Summary Court-Martial (SCM) for Attempt to record and take pictures of a Naval \nmember of the Armed Forces without consent. As a result of this conviction, Applicant \nwas reduced in rank from a Lance Corporal (E-3) to a Private First Class (E-2), and \ndischarged in about December of 2019 with an Other Than Honorable Discharge. (TR \nat page 45 line 8 to page 49 line 3, and GXs 5 and 6.) Applicant\u2019s wife, who was his \ngirlfriend in 2017, is aware of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nIn 2019, Applicant was convicted by a SCM of an offense of a sexual nature. The \nevidence establishes the above this disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has passed, more than five years since Applicant\u2019s 2017 \nmisconduct. The evidence establishes mitigation under the above conditions. Criminal \nConduct is found for Applicant. \nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted. \n((c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant attempted to take a video and pictures of a sexual nature at a semi-\npublic dressing room. His behavior was criminal, reflected bad judgment, and creates a \nvulnerability to coercion. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior occurred more than five years ago. His wife is aware \nof his indiscretion. There is evidence that future instances of this nature are unlikely to \noccur. Sexual Behavior is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline . . . : \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior. \nApplicant attempted to take a video and photos of a sexual nature in 2017. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise this disqualifying condition. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant \u2018s personal conduct indiscretion occurred more than five years ago. His \nwife is aware of his misconduct. Personal Conduct is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, D and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has taken a significant amount of training to avoid any future indiscretions. \n(AppX E.) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the personal conduct, sexual behavior, and criminal \nconduct security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3 Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On June 7, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline B. He submitted an October 25, 2021, \nresponse to the SOR and requested a decision based upon the administrative record \n(Answer).

He was born in Israel on the West Bank, and was not a \ncitizen of Israel, but was at the time considered a citizen of Jordan. He immigrated to the \nUnited States in 1989 to attend college. In 1997, he married his ex-wife in Israel, they \nseparated in 2015, and their divorce was finalized in 2017. She was born in Canada to \nAmerican citizens and is a dual citizen of both countries. They have two sons, who are \n10 and 11 years old. They were both born in Qatar but are American citizens. In 1996, he \nreceived a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from a U.S. university.

At the time of the hearing, Applicant was not \nemployed, but he was sponsored by a company who intends to hire him as a translator. \n(Tr. 12, 20-21; GE 1-3) \nAfter the September 11th  attacks, Applicant and his ex-wife moved to Jordan to live\nwith his family for approximately one year due to fears of anti-Muslim retaliation. They \nthen moved to Qatar for her work. While living in Qatar, his wife was the primary wage-\nearner for their family. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003, as a result of his \nmarriage to his ex-wife. Between 2007 and January 2015, he worked for defense \ncontractors as a security escort and then as a security manager at an Air Force base, \nwhich required him to hold a NACI. (Tr. 22-30, 38, 56-57, 68-69, 81; GE 1-4)\n \n \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s divorce paperwork, he and his wife separated in March \n2016, when he left Qatar. He testified that he went to Jordan to receive financial \nassistance from his family. His father gifted him a piece of property in Jordan worth \napproximately $200,000, which he sold, and used, in part, to pay for his divorce attorneys. \nHe then returned to the United States to start the divorce proceedings. He was \nunemployed from January 2015 to July 2016. (Tr. 22-30, 38, 56-57, 68-69, 81; GE 1-4) \nAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, \nand when she left Qatar, she filed for divorce in Canada. Based upon the \nrecommendations of Applicant\u2019s attorney, he found a job in State A in July 2016, rented \na two-bedroom apartment there, and purchased a vehicle. Between his March 2016 and \nJuly 2016, he supported himself with the money left over from selling the Jordanian \nproperty gifted to him from his father. As stated above, Applicant has been unemployed \nsince January 2017. In October 2017, he returned to Jordan to reside with his father, who \ncurrently provides him approximately $2,500 a month to pay his expenses. (Tr. 29-37; GE \n1-4) \nApplicant has not resided in the United States since October 2017. He returned to \nthe U.S. one time, in 2019, to be interviewed for his security clearance. (He listed on the \n2019 SCA his sister\u2019s address in State B as his permanent address, but he has never \nresided there.) For his SCA he provided his sister\u2019s address in State B as his permanent \naddress, but he has never resided there. He resided in Jordan with his father from October \n2017 to January 2021. He then moved to Israel with his father, where he lived as of the \nhearing date. His father has continued to financially support him since 2017. Applicant \ndoes not have a bank account or a credit card, and when he needs money, his father \ngives him cash. (Tr. 38-41; GE 1; GE 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2019 SCA, he disclosed the following visits to his family in Jordan \nduring the previous seven years: 3/12-4/12; 6/13; 5/14-6/14; 7/15; 1/16; 3/16; and 6/16. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s May 2019 interview, the government investigator reviewed his U.S. \npassport (valid from October 2008 to October 2018) and noted the following stamps from \nJordan: 10/09; 6/10; 7/10; 9/10; 11/10; 3/11; 6/11; 7/11; 11/11; 12/11; 6/13; 3/16; 4/16; \n5/16; and 10/17.

At one time his father \nowned the only insurance company in Israel and owned an extensive real estate portfolio. \n\u201cI know my dad is rich, but my dad is secretive. [H]e likes to help his kids, \nbut he doesn\u2019t mention what he\u2019s got. [W]hen I went to Jordan, I realized \nhe\u2019s richer than what I thought. And when I came to Israel I \u2026 now know \nhe\u2019s \u2026 richer than what I thought in Jordan even.\u201d \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant estimated he would inherit assets in Jordan and \nIsrael worth approximately $1.5 million. (Tr. 42-43; GE 3) \nWhen Applicant was born in Israel, he was issued a Jordanian passport. Because \nhe was born on the West Bank in Israel and he is not Jewish, he cannot be a citizen of \nIsrael. His Jordanian passport or travel document (he has made inconsistent statements \nregarding the document) expired in 2018. His Israel identification card does not have an \nexpiration date. He cannot live in Israel without it, and he must show it with his U.S. \npassport when he enters and exits Israel. (Tr. 44-46, 72-74; GE 1; GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s parents, brother, and sisters reside in both Jordan and Israel. His \nparents own land in both countries, and his brother lives in part of their parents\u2019 home in \nIsrael. Their homes in the two countries are approximately one hour apart. Two of his \nsisters reside in Jordan and Israel. None of his family members work for either the \nJordanian or the Israeli governments. (Tr. 48-54, 72) \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied having close ties to his family residing in Jordan \nand Israel, including his parents who provide him complete financial support and with \nwhom he resides. However, due to living with his parents, he does speak to his siblings \nwhen they call his parents, and his brother resides in the same building. Additionally, \nApplicant provides hourly care to his father and is essentially his caretaker. \u201cI\u2019m by myself \n24/7 except my dad. I\u2019m helping my dad. I don\u2019t go anywhere.

The U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria and the U.S. \ngovernment\u2019s policies regarding Israel led more than 80% of Jordanians to hold an \nunfavorable opinion of the U.S. government, although the anti-Western sentiment did not \nextend to U.S. citizens or culture generally.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s parents, brother, and two of his sisters are residents of Jordan and \nIsrael. He is currently a resident of Israel, residing with his parents, and from October \n2017 to January 2021, he was a resident of Jordan, residing with his parents. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with people living in a foreign country is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his or \nher spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship with \neven one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing \nproblematic visits of that applicant\u2019s father in Iran). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws.

The country\u2019s human rights record is another \nimportant consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). Another important consideration is the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with the United States. These factors are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that \ncountry are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The situations in Jordan and \nIsrael involving terrorists, criminals, and insurgents in those countries place a significant \nburden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her relationships with any family \nmembers living in or visiting them do not pose a security risk because of the risks of \nviolence and coercion in those countries. Applicant should not be placed into a position \nwhere he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and concerns \nabout assisting someone living in, visiting, or associated with Jordan and Israel. \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, n. 18 (App. Bd. July 28, 2005), \nexplained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on \ntheir prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is whether an \napplicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members in a foreign \ncountry raise security concerns because those ties and contacts create a \npotential vulnerability that a foreign power, [criminals, or terrorists] could \nseek to exploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified \ninformation that an applicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers -- has by virtue of a security clearance. A person may be \nvulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, the person\u2019s \nimmediate family members -- regardless of whether the person\u2019s family \nmembers are prominent or not. \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries hostile \nto the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at \n5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical \nfields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-\n26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with people who are living in Jordan and Israel or visiting \nthose countries create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists, criminals, or \ngovernment officials could place pressure on people in those countries in an effort to \ncause Applicant to compromise classified information. Those relationships create \u201ca \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 \n7. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with \npeople living in those countries and has raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply, and further inquiry is necessary \nabout potential application of any mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n9 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAs indicated in the disqualifying conditions Foreign Influence section, supra, \nApplicant has several family members who are residents of Jordan and Israel. \nApplicant is a citizen of the United States residing in Israel, and he recently resided \nin Jordan for several years. He lived in Jordan for a year from 2001 to 2002. He became \na naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003. There is no record information regarding his visits to \nJordan or Israel between 2002 and 2009. He visited his family numerous times in Jordan \nbetween 2009 and 2017, when he permanently moved to Jordan to live with his parents \nwho financially support him. He has ongoing, continuous, and frequent contact with his \nfamily members in Jordan and Iraq through his residence with his parents. \nApplicant\u2019s living with his parents qualifies as frequent contact. A key factor in the \nAG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S.\u201d Applicant has minimal assets in the U.S., and except for one sister and her family, \nan uncle and some cousins, the remaining members of his family of origin reside in Jordan \nand Israel. His children currently reside in Canada with his ex-wife, and he has no contact \nwith them, and appears to provide no financial support to them. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by her relationships with relatives who are residents \nof Jordan and Israel. Applicant has close relationships with family, and they are at risk \nfrom criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of the Jordanian and Israeli \ngovernments. Applicant\u2019s access to classified information could add significant risk to his \nrelatives and contacts living in Jordan and Israel. \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives and contacts residing in Jordan \nand Israel are significant, and he has insignificant financial connections and familial \nconnections to the United States; therefore, they are insufficient to overcome the foreign \ninfluence security concerns under Guideline B. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n10\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nA Guideline B decision concerning Jordan and/or Israel must take into \nconsideration the geopolitical situation and dangers in those countries.

Those \ncountries are dangerous places because of violence from terrorists and criminals, and \ntheir governments do not respect the full spectrum of human rights. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401.

(Response at 6.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and her credit reports establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) \n(\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  (g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant argues she has faced financial hardships and setbacks for various \nreasons such as her husband\u2019s job loss and layoffs or contracts ending. Over the past \nyear or so she has become more financially stable as she pays off her various debts, \nwhich has made funds available to address her other debts, specifically citing her federal \ntax debt and student loans. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. The bankruptcy alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was filed \nand discharged in 2011 and she has not filed for bankruptcy since. Applicant\u2019s unresolved \nfederal tax debt, unresolved student loans, and her limited progress resolving her other \ndebts over a period of eleven years did not occur under circumstances unlikely to recur \nand raise doubts about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Her husband\u2019s employment situation, medical \nproblems, medical debts, and periods of unemployment were largely beyond her control. \nShe acted responsibly by developing and successfully executing a plan to resolve her \ndelinquent state taxes, and by resolving her delinquent automobile loan and credit card \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.j, and 1.q). When the IRS suspended her federal tax debt, it noted she \nwas still responsible for interest and penalties for the delinquent tax years. She was \nadvised during the suspension to make voluntary payments and that the IRS had \n\u201ctemporarily closed\u201d her case. However, she has provided insufficient evidence that she \nhas acted responsibly regarding her delinquent federal income taxes and student loans. \nHer federal tax plan has not progressed sufficiently to constitute responsible actions \nunder the circumstances for delinquent taxes for the alleged tax years, 2007 through \n2018. She remains in the planning process to resolve her student loans. The voluntary \npayment she provided on her tax year 2011 federal taxes was made after her Answer. \nHer failure to take any action on these delinquent accounts until now does not constitute \na good-faith debt resolution. See ISCR Case No. 10-05909 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2012). \nAn applicant who begins to resolve their debts only after having been placed on notice \nthat their clearance or trustworthiness designations are in jeopardy may be disinclined to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfollow rules and regulations when their personal interests are not at stake. ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Although Applicant would have received \nfinancial counseling during her bankruptcy proceedings, her financial problems are not \nunder control. She does not have an approved payment plan for either from the IRS or \nthe Department of Education. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) are partially established. Applicant successfully completed \nher payment plan to resolve her delinquent state income taxes. She does not have \npayment plans in effect for her delinquent federal taxes or her student loans. She receives \nsome mitigation credit for reducing some of these debts by voluntary payments after \nreceiving the FORM and initiating discussions with the IRS and Department of Education \nto establish a payment plans. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Her \ndelinquent federal taxes still total over $400,000 and her delinquent student loans total \nover $200,000. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003).

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the sole Guideline J allegation, (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and noted that the case remained pending in court. He denied the four debts alleged under Guideline F (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) noting that they had all been paid. His admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. He has worked as an instructor with a defense contractor on a military base since February 2019, and he has had several prior jobs in the defense industry. After eight years on active duty in the Marine Corps (1994-2002), he served in the National Guard and Reserve from 2003 until July 2016, when he retired as a staff sergeant (E-6). He deployed to Iraq in 2004- 2005 and again in 2009-2010. He worked as a police officer from 2014-2017. His first marriage ended in divorce (1999-2004). He remarried in 2009. They have two young children. (GE 2; Tr. 12 36-40, 61-62) He has held a clearance since his time in the 2 military, and was most recently granted a clearance in 2015, without any security violations. (Tr. 12, 85-86) Under Guideline F, the SOR concerns four delinquent debts, totaling $11,790. The debts are established by an April 2021 credit report. (GE 4) (SOR \u00b6 2) Applicant denied all of the debts, and said they had been paid. (Answer; Tr. 43) Applicant provided an e-mail",

The \ncase was assigned to me on June 1, 2023. On July 6, 2023, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for July 27, 2023, with the hearing to occur via an online video-\nteleconferencing platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. The attorney representing Applicant in his \npending criminal case appeared on his behalf, acting as a personal representative. (Tr. \n6-8) He also offered information on the current status of the criminal case. Department \nCounsel submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4.

At the end of the hearing, I held the record open until August 10, 2023, to \nenable Applicant the opportunity to submit additional information but he did not do so. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 4, 2023. \nPreliminary Issue \nBecause this case involved a pending criminal charge against Applicant, and \nbecause his criminal defense attorney participated in the hearing, I made them both \naware of Paragraph 6.2 of the Directive, under which \u201can applicant is required to give, \nand to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material \nquestions needed by the DOHA to reach a clearance decision, and to otherwise comply \nwith the procedures authorized by this Directive.\u201d (Tr. 8, 77) Applicant testified, and did \nnot exercise his constitutional right not to do so under the Fifth Amendment. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the sole Guideline J allegation, \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and noted that the case remained pending in court. He denied the four \ndebts alleged under Guideline F (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) noting that they had all been paid. \nHis admission is incorporated into the findings of fact.

He has worked \nas an instructor with a defense contractor on a military base since February 2019, and \nhe has had several prior jobs in the defense industry. After eight years on active duty in \nthe Marine Corps (1994-2002), he served in the National Guard and Reserve from 2003 \nuntil July 2016, when he retired as a staff sergeant (E-6). He deployed to Iraq in 2004-\n2005 and again in 2009-2010. He worked as a police officer from 2014-2017. His first \nmarriage ended in divorce (1999-2004). He remarried in 2009.

(Tr. 12, 85-86) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR concerns four delinquent debts, totaling $11,790. \nThe debts are established by an April 2021 credit report. (GE 4) (SOR \u00b6 2) Applicant \ndenied all of the debts, and said they had been paid. (Answer; Tr. 43) \nApplicant provided an e-mail about his attempts to contact his creditors. (AE A). \nHe attached photographs of letters from two of the creditors (AE B, AE C) along with his \ncredit score as of June 2023. (AE D) I was unable to print a \u201cclean copy\u201d of these \nexhibits for the case file, but they are part of the record in e-mail form, and they can be \nreviewed on appeal if needed. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a ($7,283) is a charged-off consumer credit account. Applicant e-mailed \na photo of a letter from the creditor, documenting that the account was paid and settled \nin December 2021. The account number on the letter is the same account number for \nthis debt in GE 4. (AE A) This was a personal loan. It was the first debt he addressed \nafter ending his contract with a debt consolidation firm, discussed below. He settled the \ndebt for 35% of what he owed, and he paid it off. (Tr. 52-55) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b ($1,640) is a charged-off credit card account with a department store. \nApplicant e-mailed a photo of a letter from the creditor, documenting that the account \nwas paid and settled in July 2021. (AE B; Tr. 55) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c ($1,171) is a charged-off credit card account with a bank. SOR \u00b6 2.d \n($1,696) is a charged-off credit card account with a bank. Applicant said he paid both \ndebts in 2021 but was not able to document it. (Tr. 32-33; 55-57) \nWhen asked how he got into debt, Applicant explained that he wanted to get a \nbetter handle on his finances and cut down on high interest rates. He learned about a \ndebt consolidation program through an acquaintance. He signed up for the program in \nJanuary 2020. The monthly fee was $700 a month. Applicant had seven or eight debts \nin the program. He was told to stop paying on his debts so the service could negotiate \nsettlements. This led to a significant drop in his credit score, from about 700 to about \n500. The company also kept 27% of any negotiated settlement amount. He believes he \ngot bad advice, and he thinks he got scammed. Applicant was not happy with the \nprogram\u2019s progress, so he paid all of the SOR debts himself by the end of 2021, well \nbefore he got the SOR. His credit score has improved to 682 as of June 2023. He said \nhe pulls his credit score \u201cdaily\u201d through a credit monitoring service.

(Tr. 60) \nApplicant was given the opportunity to submit post-hearing documents, such as \nan updated credit report, but did not do so. The April 2021 credit report (GE 4) is the \nonly one in the record. \nIn February 2020, Applicant was working as a security manager (bouncer) at a \nfriend\u2019s nightclub. (GE 2 at 2) He disclosed on his SCA that one evening that month, he \nhad a physical altercation with an \u201cunruly patron,\u201d D, who refused to leave the premises. \nHe said that D \u201ctook an aggressive stance attempting to fight me and I went hands on \ncausing him to have a hard landing on a take down.\u201d D \u201cis now said to be paralyzed \nfrom the neck down.\u201d Applicant was later charged with aggravated battery. He said he \nbelieves this is because of the nature of the injuries, and because Applicant used to be \na police officer. (GE 1 at 31-33) \nApplicant provided further detail in his background interview. (GE 2) He said D \nhad been arrested and banned from the premises by police two months beforehand for \nfighting. (GE 1, GE 2) On the night in question Applicant was on duty at about 4 am. He \nwas told by another security guard, W, that D was on the premises. They agreed to \nleave him alone and let the police deal with him in the parking lot once he left. (GE 2) \nAbout 15 minutes later, another security guard, C, was in an argument with a \nfemale patron, and was trying to get her to leave. The female patron was married to D, \nbut Applicant was not aware of this. D was in the corner with several other patrons. D \nchallenged Applicant with an \u201caggressive position\u201d towards him. Applicant was aware \nthat D had assaulted other security officers. (GE 2) \nAnother security guard, B, grabbed D\u2019s arm and said, \u201cHey, man, let\u2019s get you \nout of here.\u201d D then swung his arm at B and hit his arm away. Applicant then punched D \nand D fell down. When D got up, he put his hands into fists, so Applicant put him into an \narm hold. D fell down and hit his head and was knocked unconscious. Applicant \ndragged D out into the parking lot where police could render him assistance. (GE 2) \nApplicant was questioned by police at the scene and the next day. He was told \nhe did nothing wrong. Days later he was told to come to the police station and explain \nwhat happened and he did so. He was then arrested and detained in county jail for four \nweeks until he could post bond. Applicant believes D\u2019s family made complaints to the \npolice about Applicant getting special treatment as a former police officer. (GE 2) \nApplicant believes that D and his family are accusing Applicant of being the \naggressor, that D was trying to leave, that Applicant attacked D unprovoked, rammed \nhis head into the bar, and stomped and kicked him.

(GE 2) \nApplicant said he was acting in self-defense. He said he has used the arm hold \nnumerous times before in prior law enforcement positions and no one has fallen as a \nresult. He said in his interview that information available to him is that D is a known \ngang member, he has been jailed numerous times for gun, drug, and assault charges, \nand has a violent history of fighting security guards and police officers. He also believes \nD\u2019s alcohol level was \u201ctwo times over the legal limit\u201d on the night in question. (GE 2) \nThese assertions are uncorroborated. \nA police report narrative from that evening indicates that D and his wife got into \nan altercation with club security after D\u2019s wife had an argument with another female \npatron. D approached security in an aggressive manner. Security asked D and his wife \nto leave, but his wife did not want to. Security then grabbed D\u2019s arm to escort him out. D \nswatted the officer\u2019s hand away. \u201cSecurity took that as an act of aggression and \npreemptively struck [D] before he could strike\u201d the officer. D had consumed alcoholic \nbeverages prior to this incident. (GE 3) \nD attempted to snatch his arm away from security \u201cto escape while being \nescorted. At that time, an arm bar take down was used to subdue [D] where he landed \nheadfirst onto the establishment[\u2018s] floor.\u201d Surveillance footage showed that D \u201chad \ngone limp upon contact with the floor. Security then [dragged D towards the door, where \nhe was placed outside.\u201d He was placed in a chair and an ambulance was called. \u201cThere \nwas visible swelling and bleeding on [D\u2019s] forehead and lips.\u201d While waiting for the \nambulance, D\u2019s wife could be heard screaming and cursing. An ambulance took D to \nthe hospital. (GE 3) \nD was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. The report lists D and his \nwife as \u201cSuspects.\u201d A female patron is listed as \u201cvictim\u201d and Applicant is listed as \n\u201cOther.\u201d The report states, \u201c[t]his is the second time that deputies know of that [D and \nhis wife] have caused an incident\u201d with the security staff at this club. In a prior incident, \nD was arrested for disorderly conduct at the same establishment. The police report \nnoted that Applicant was 6 feet tall and weighed 230 pounds. D was listed as 5 feet, \nseven inches tall, and weighed 140 pounds. (GE 3) The security officer(s) involved are \nnot identified in GE 3. \nApplicant was later arrested and charged with aggravated battery. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nOther than GE 3, there is no police report, indictment record, or other documentary \nevidence providing details of the incident relating to Applicant as a suspect, charged \nindividual, or defendant. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal defense attorney made certain representations about the \ncurrent status of the case and about its procedural history.

The case was passed to several prosecuting attorneys before an \nindictment was brought in September 2022 but there is no pending court date. (Tr. 64-\n68, 75-76)  \nThe attorney confirmed that the alleged victim has brought a civil suit against \nApplicant. There are multiple witnesses to, and videotapes of, the incident. (None of \nthem are in evidence here). He believes that police officers who are familiar with the \nincident (on scene or having viewed the videos) would regard Applicant\u2019s actions as \n\u201ctextbook.\u201d The other party has a prior record. The attorney believes he has a strong \ncase. He expressed doubt as to the severity of the alleged victim\u2019s injuries. (Tr. 68-70) \nApplicant confirmed he is being sued, along with the county, the nightclub, and \nthe property owner. He was not working as an off-duty police officer at the time. He \nbelieves he was charged because, since he was a former county police officer, the \ndepartment did not want to be seen showing favoritism towards him. (Tr. 70-72) \nApplicant affirmed what he said previously about the incident, both on his SCA \nand in his background interview. He was in a working capacity, and said, \u201cI did my job.\u201d \nHe does not believe it should have gone this far and turned into criminal charges. He \nbelieves the victim was banned from the property two months prior and chose to return. \nApplicant said his only intent \u201cwas to get him out the door, not to injure him. So it was a \nfreak accident. He went down wrong and landed the way he did.\u201d (Tr. 80-81) Applicant \ndenied committing the crime as alleged and as charged. (Tr. 82) \nApplicant had an alcohol-related driving offense in the mid-1990s. He said he \nwas found not guilty. He was charged with domestic violence in about 2000 but he said \nthe case was dismissed. (Tr. 83-84) \nApplicant attested to his long service in the military, with a clearance. He has \ntaken many security courses. (Tr. 31) He wants to keep his clearance and his career, \nand he wants to protect his assets and his reputation. (Tr. 85, 93-94) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout, in relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nIn about January 2020, Applicant had some debts that he wanted to resolve. He \nwas advised informally to hire a debt consolidation firm to address them. He did so, and \nthe firm charged a large fee for his services. They also told him to stop paying on his \ndebts. This led to several delinquencies, four of which are alleged in the SOR, and \nestablished by GE 4, an April 2021 credit report. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nOnce Applicant realized that the debt firm was not doing what he hired them to \ndo, he addressed the debts himself. Some of the debts he said he resolved were paid \nwell before the SOR was issued, so they are not alleged. Two of the alleged debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, totaling about $8,900) are documented as having been settled, \npaid, and resolved, in 2021, before the SOR was issued. Applicant said he paid the \nother two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, totaling just under $3,000) that year as well, and I \nbelieve he did so. The record does not contain a more recent credit report, but Applicant \nhas ample assets, income, and savings, making future financial issues unlikely. The \nfuture financial impact of his ongoing criminal case, is, of course, unclear. However, \nbased on his actions to address his prior debts, Applicant has shown sufficient evidence \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) to mitigate financial security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct:  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nIn February 2020, while working security at a nightclub, Applicant had a physical \naltercation with a patron. The patron had been barred from the club two months before. \nApplicant said the patron moved in on him in an aggressive manner. When Applicant \ntook the patron down, the patron was evidently badly injured, though how badly is \nunclear. Applicant said the patron hit his head and was knocked unconscious. After \nApplicant dragged him outside, he was taken to a hospital in an ambulance. The patron \nhas filed a lawsuit against Applicant and other entities. The patron was charged with \ndisorderly conduct. Applicant was later indicted on a charge of aggravated battery. The \ncharge remains pending, and no trial date is imminent. The record here does not \ncontain any documentary evidence of the indictment or his arrest. The only police \nrecord provided concerns a charge against the patron, not the Applicant. \nApplicant admits the arrest and the charge, which he disclosed on his SCA and \ndiscussed freely in his background interview. In his testimony, he stood by what he said \npreviously about the incident. He denies any criminal intent and denies doing anything \nwrong. He believes he acted properly. This is the only criminal offense alleged in the \nSOR. (Applicant has two other prior charges, but they are many years old). \nApplicant\u2019s statements are enough to satisfy AG \u00b6 31(b), since he acknowledges \nthat he was indicted and charged with felony aggravated battery. This is so despite the \nabsence of additional related police or court documentation which might have shed \nadditional light on the events in question. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIn this forum, the standard of proof is not \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d but rather, \n\u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d that is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate evidence to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence \nin the same record.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; see, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018); ISCR Case No. 20-00354 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2022). \nSince the charge has not been adjudicated fully (or at all) in criminal court, it is \nquite difficult to make an assessment here about what really happened that night at the \nclub. Applicant provided a full explanation of his view of the events in his background \ninterview, and he has asserted his innocence. He said he did not intend to injure D, the \npatron, that what happened was an accident, and that he did his job. He asserted that \nthe patron, who had been banned from the property, was the aggressor. As Department \nCounsel noted in his closing argument, the police report would seem to support \nApplicant\u2019s version of events. (Tr. 91) \nThe charge is serious and pending. It is also isolated and there is no indication of \nprior or subsequent similar conduct. Applicant is also no longer working as a bouncer. \nHe continues to work at his job on a military base. He holds a current clearance, \ngranted in 2015, without incident. I conclude that the incident occurred under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) both partially \napply. They cannot fully apply since the case is pending. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and F in my whole-person analysis. \nThe financial security concerns in this case are resolved and mitigated. As to the \nGuideline J case, the fact that the criminal charge remains pending cannot be ignored, \nand I decline to find in this forum that Applicant established his innocence by substantial \nevidence. He has been indicted and that indictment remains pending. The resulting \nevents have yet to be adjudicated in state criminal court. However, I do conclude that \nApplicant testified credibly in this hearing about the events in February 2020. He also \ndisclosed the charge on his SCA and discussed his version of events in his background \ninterview. The only police report in the record also supports his assertions (though it \nwas before he was indicted). \nAs Department Counsel acknowledged, a subsequent conviction would likely \nlead to an adverse information report to DOD security officials, given its security \nsignificance. (Tr. 92) As Applicant acknowledged, if he is convicted, he might go to jail. \n(Tr. 93-94) \nWith the arrest and indictment unadjudicated in criminal court, however, and with \nthe financial case fully resolved, I conclude that Applicant has met his burden to \nestablish that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information based on the record before me. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nBraden M.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate personal conduct concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 21, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Central Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of \nreasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing reasons why under the personal conduct \nguidelines, the DCSA could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of \neligibility for granting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of six exhibits. (GEs \n1-6) Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and two exhibits. (AEs C-D) The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on February 9, 2023. \n Summary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) was debarred by the Army between \nJanuary 2018 and October 2020 from government contracting and doing business with\nthe government based upon his conspiratorial actions to restrain trade in violation of 18\nU.S.C.  \u00a7 371 and the Sherman Antitrust Act , 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  371; (b) failed to notify his\nemployer of his debarment and continued to work on government contracts throughout\nhis entire work period; and (c) falsified material facts during a January 16, 2019\ninterview with an authorized investigator for the U,s, Department of Defense (DoD)\nwhen he denied any knowledge of the debarment covered by subparagraph 1.a, when\nin truth  he received notice of the Army\u2019s proposed debarment in September 2017 and\nthe subsequent debarment action in January 2018. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Army\u2019s debarment actions, \nbut denied his failing to notify his employer of the Army\u2019s actions and denied his failing \nto disclose the Army\u2019s debarment actions in his January 2019 personal subject interview \n(PSI) and with a DoD investigator. Applicant claimed he notified his employer\u2019s \nsupervisor of his 2018 debarment. He also claimed he notified his supervisor of his \n2019 PSI and substance thereof in January 2019. Applicant further claimed he notified \nhis supervisor of the ending of his debarment in October 2020 and later informed him of \na notification in July 2021 for follow-up questions regarding his PSI. And, he claimed he \nnotified his supervisor in October 2021 of his receipt of the SOR regarding his eligibility \nfor holding a security clearance. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GEs 1 and 5; Tr. 13) \nSince October 2015, Applicant has been employed by his current contractor as a \ncrew chief in the field of aircraft maintenance. (GEs 1 and 5) Between March 2014 and \nOctober 2015, he worked for a copper mining company as a diagnostic mechanic. (GE \n1) He worked for a volunteer fire department in his local community between October \n2002 and January 2015. Contemporaneously, he operated his own small engine repair \nshop and retail equipment dealership between May 2012 and March 2014. (GEs 1 and \n5; Tr. 24) Applicant and his wife owned separate companies between 2008 and 2011, \nand both  were dissolved in 2011. (Tr. 23) Applicant has held a security clearance \nbetween February 1990 and March 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 22, 32)  \nApplicant\u2019s debarment history \nBetween 2008 and 2011, Applicant was president and owner of a government \nsubcontractor for a prime contractor (A Company) of the Government. In 2013, he \nsubmitted two bids to the prime contractor of the Government (A Company): one from \nhis company and another from his wife\u2019s wholly-owned company. Presumably, he was \nauthorized by his wife to submit a bid on behalf of her company. Following his \nsubmissions of the two bids, he was investigated by the FBI about his finances. (Tr. 25-\n27) Later in 2013, he was interviewed by the FBI again about his finances, (GE 5; Tr. \n26-27, 36)  \nIn January 2018, Applicant received a debarment package following his return \nfrom overseas civilian deployment. (GE 2; Tr. 30) In the cover letter, Applicant was \nnotified by the Army\u2019s suspension and debarment official of the official\u2019s debarment of \nApplicant and his company (effective January 18, 2018 and continuing until October 19, \n2020) from conducting business with the Government as representatives or agents of \nother contactors and from acting as individual sureties. (GE 2) Applicant\u2019s debarment \nalso served to exclude him from non-procurement transactions with the Government, \nsuch as grants, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, payments for specified \nuse, and donation agreements. (GEs 2-3) \nThe Government\u2019s debarment of Applicant and his company from conducting \nbusiness for the specified two-year period was based on the recited material facts in the \ndebarment official\u2019s January 2018 debarment cover letter to Applicant. (GE 2) \nSummarized, Applicant and his company were debarred for having prepared and \nsubmitted two bids to the Army\u2019s prime contractor as a subcontractor in 2013 (one from \nApplicant\u2019s company and another from his wife\u2019s company) that he knew, or should \nhave known, were not competitive.

In each instance, Applicant told the investigator that he had no knowledge of any \nissues could impact his employment. (GE 5) In follow-up questioning about issues \narising from Applicant\u2019s work with the Army\u2019s prime contractor between 2010 and 2013, \nApplicant acknowledged being interviewed by both the FBI and IRS about the prime \ncontractor\u2019s activities and what his company did for the contractor.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n                                       \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n Personal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulation \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, and trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special \ninterest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers \nduring national security investigative or adjudicative processes . . . AG \n\u00b6 15. \n   Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s 2018 debarment from federal \ncontracting in January 2018, and his ensuing failures to continue working his employer\u2019s \nfederal contracts without disclosing his debarment and continuing work on his \nemployer\u2019s government contracts while subject to the Government\u2019s debarment \nrestrictions and ongoing FBI and DoD investigations. These actions by Applicant \nwarrant the application of one of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the personal \nconduct guideline: DC \u00b6 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative \nissue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any single \nguideline, but which, when considered together as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admitted debarment requires no independent proof to substantiate \nthem. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006). \nHis admitted debarment is fully documented and creates judgment issues as well over \nthe management of his bid submissions to prime contractors contracting with the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nHonesty, trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in a person cleared to \nprotect classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the \nholder of a security clearance that entitles the person to access classified information. \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his two-year debarment precluded him from conducting any \nbusiness with the Government for the duration o his debarment. Without advising senior \nofficials of his employer of his debarment and restrictions on conducting business on his \nemployer\u2019s federal contracts, he placed his employer at considerable risk to \nGovernment oversight and potential debarment penalties as well. \nConsidering \nall \nof \nthe \nexhibits \nand \ntestimony \nin \nthis \ncase, \nand according weight to Applicant\u2019s expressed remorse, and explanations of his \njudgment mistakes, none of the mitigating conditions covered by Guideline E have \nspecific application to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case and are not available to Applicant \nbased on the developed facts in the record.. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his judgment lapses and candor lapses associated with his \n2018 Army debarment are fully compatible with minimum standards for holding a \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n             \n \n \n \n                                  \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nclearance.

Four out of five of these debts became delinquent in 2019 \ndue to her unemployment that began in April 2017. Her Chapter 7 Bankruptcy discharge \nand the absence of any more recent delinquent debts provides an adequate basis to \nresolve the financial considerations guideline in her favor. Eligibility for security \nclearance access is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 7, 2020, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) for a security clearance required in her employment \nwith a defense contractor. On August 17 and September 8, 2020, she provided two \npersonal interviews (PSIs) with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM). The Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAS) could not make the affirmative findings \nrequired to continue a security clearance, and issued to Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), dated August 23, 2021, detailing security concerns raised by financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F).

The total amount of debt is approximately $47,830. \nThe debts became delinquent between July 2015 and November 2019. Applicant \nadmitted that she owed the debts, and the Government credit bureau reports confirm \nher admission. Though she believes that her financial difficulties may be the reason for \nthe denial of previous security clearance applications, no one ever told her exactly why \nshe was denied a security clearance. (October 2021 answer to SOR; GE 2; GE 3; Tr. \n10-11, 19) \nApplicant is 47 years old. She is single with no children. She was living with her \nsister from September 2018 to April 2022, when she moved into a rental with a \nroommate. After completing high school, she collected some college credits but earned \nno degree. (GE 1 at 9-11; Tr. 6-9, 22) \nApplicant has been employed as a financial analyst with her current employer \nsince January 2020; this employment is the second time that she has worked for this \ncompany. From January 2018 to January 2020, she was an owner of an aesthetics \norganization directed at helping primarily individuals organize rooms and spaces within \ntheir homes. She also helped them pack and move household possessions if needed. \nThe business generated about $6,000 in 2018 and about $8,000 in 2019. Applicant \nbelieves she is behind on federal taxes related to the business for tax year 2019 or \n2020. When she discovered the business was not generating sufficient income, she \ndecided to return to government contracting for better job security. (GE 1 at 13-21; GE \n2; Tr. 8-11, 36, 38-39) \n2 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThough Applicant cited employment at a veteran\u2019s association from May 2014 \nto June 2018, she never worked for the association because she was unable to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. As noted the preceding paragraph, Applicant\u2019s first employment with \nher current employer was from October 2011 to April 2017, when the contract ended. \nDuring this employment, she was classified as a junior systems analyst. (GE 1 at 13-21; \nGE 2; Tr. 8-11) \nApplicant purchased a home in 2007. She lived there until 2012, when she \nbegan renting the dwelling. The monthly rent was $100 to $150 less than the monthly \nmortgage. She had no problems keeping the dwelling rented between 2012 and 2018, \nwith occasional short periods when she cleaned the home after renters moved out and \nbefore new renters moved in. When Applicant became unemployed in 2017, she \nencountered increasing trouble paying the mortgage. In September 2019, the current \ntenants were not paying the rent regularly and Applicant was unable to pay the \nmortgage. With the property about to go into foreclosure, Applicant was granted a stay \nthe foreclosure proceedings, allowing her time to sell the property and pay off the \nbalance of the mortgage. Whatever profit Applicant made on the sale was absorbed in \nher refinancing of the mortgage on several occasions and renovations she made to the \nhome. (Tr. 23-30) \nWhen Applicant lost her job in April 2017, she managed to get by on her \nsavings, her 401(k) retirement account, and financial help from her sister and mother. \nShe exhausted her retirement account and received about $600 a month from her \nfamily members in 2018. She was not as dependent on her family in 2019 because she \nwas earning some income from her aesthetic organization. (GE 1 at 17-18; Tr. 32-34) \nAt the end of 2017, Applicant realized that she could no longer make payments \non the SOR \u00b6 1.a credit card. (The other listed accounts fell delinquent in the same \nfashion.) Though she provided no supporting documentation, she testified that she \nphoned the SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor in February or March 2018 to negotiate payment \narrangements. Without a steady income, she realized in a month or two that she could \nnot sustain payment plans. She did not try to do anything until she had a source of \nincome. She did not know what to do because she had never had financial problems \nlike this. She always paid her debts on time. Applicant did not contact the SOR \u00b6 1.a \ncreditor again (or the other creditors) based on the advice of her attorney. (Tr. 42-46, \n50) \nIn late 2018, Applicant\u2019s plan for dealing with her delinquent debt was to regain \nemployment with her current employer. By resuming employment, she would again be \nable to have a regular paycheck, so that she could recover financially. When her current \nemployer was awarded the contract, she thought she would start working immediately, \nbut administrative missteps caused delays. She claimed that she was issued a security \nclearance that for some reason was transferred. Because of an administrative mistake, \na reinvestigation of her security clearance was launched. As time passed, she applied \nfor other positions in government contracting, or in administrative positions. After a few \n3 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmonths, she expanded her search and recalled sending three to five applications a \nweek in 2018 and 2019. She did not begin working for her current employer until \nJanuary 2020. (GE 1 at 36; Tr. 47-50) \nAfter speaking with an attorney and a few creditors, Applicant concluded at the \nend of 2020 that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was the best option because she had \ntoo much debt. She estimated the payments of $900 a month to the creditors would \nmake it difficult for her to pay her rent. (Tr. 55-57) Applicant filed her Chapter 7 petition \nin December 2020 and the listed debts were discharged in March 2021, about four \nmonths before the issuance of the SOR in August 2021. (AE A; AE B) \nThough unsupported by documentation, Applicant claimed that she paid \nseveral debts with lower balances at some time before the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \nproceeding (December 2020) to reduce the number of debts that she had outstanding. \nShe learned that because she did not close the accounts when she paid them off, they \nremained listed in the bankruptcy. As an example, she claimed that she paid off the \nSOR \u00b6 1.e debt before the account was discharged in the bankruptcy. In a phone \nconversation, this creditor informed her that the account was still listed as past due in \nthe bankruptcy and in their records. Applicant ruminated about hiring an attorney to \nremove some of the paid off accounts from the bankruptcy. (Tr. 50-52) Her Chapter 7 \npetition shows that the debts of four unlisted creditors were discharged along with the \nlisted creditors. (AE A; AE B at 20-24) \nApplicant explained that she completed an online financial counseling course \nmandated by the bankruptcy court. Records show that she completed the course in \nNovember 2020. (AE F) There is no documentation to support her claim of receiving live \nfinancial counseling from an instructor in January 2021. As a part of the counseling, \nApplicant generated a budget. She noted that she has been using a budget for about 10 \nyears. She generates the budget in a computer spreadsheet program. However, she \ndeletes her budget every two months. Though Applicant claimed to have a written \nbudget for the last couple of months, the budget that she submitted appears to be \nbased on a $1,974 paycheck that she received on October 21, 2022. The budget does \nnot include the all the expenses that she identified during her testimony. She testified \nthat her monthly rent was $1,300, but her budget shows her monthly rent as $1,100. \nWhile Applicant indicated that she paid off $9,200 in loans she received from her sister \nand her mother in 2018 and 2019, her budget shows she apparently resumed borrowing \nfrom her mother for a rental deposit for her current residence. (Tr. 58-60-63, 65; 66-68; \nAE D) \nThe 2020 Government credit bureau report (CBR) shows that the SOR \u00b6 1.c \ndebt became delinquent in 2015. The other listed debts became delinquent in 2019. \n(GE 3 at 8-9) According to the CBR, Applicant has no other delinquent debts. There is \nno evidence showing that Applicant incurred any delinquent debt after March 2021.

(AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied together with common sense and the general factors of the whole-person \nconcept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires \nthat \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person\u2019s practice of responsibly managing her financial obligations is a \nprivate matter until evidence reveals that she is not paying her debts in a timely fashion. \nAdverse evidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of \nproving delinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, \n2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The Government credit \nreport (GE 3) establishes that the one of the five debts (SOR \u00b6 1.c) became delinquent \nin 2015 and the other debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e) in 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19 \n(c) apply.  \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts started to fall delinquent about six years before her Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy discharge in March 2021. The debts are still considered recent because \nthey were resolved through bankruptcy less than two years ago. Her accumulation of \n$47,830 in delinquent debts raises lingering security concerns about her reliability and \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment from April 2017 to January 2020 was an unforeseen \ncondition beyond her control and justifying mitigation under the first prong of AG \u00b6 \n20(b). She decided to start her own business in 2018 to generate income while \nsearching for employment unsuccessfully. She did not anticipate the lack of sufficient \nincome would force her to close the business and return to government contracting in \nJanuary 2020 for job stability. After evaluating her options in discussions with a lawyer, \nshe decided to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in December 2020. Following her \nunemployment and underemployment from April 2017 to January 2020, the record \nfurnishes sufficient evidence that she acted responsibly under the circumstances to \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nobtain a complete Chapter 7 discharge of the listed debts in March 2021.

Although Applicant is not entitled to mitigation under the first \nprong of AG \u00b6 20(d), her Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge is a legally authorized means \nto extinguish the delinquent debt and obtain a fresh start under the circumstances of \nthis case. See Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934). \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 47 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor as a \nfinancial analyst since January 2020. Before her unemployment the underemployment \nfrom April 2017 to January 2020, she was working for this company almost six years. \nAfter providing her PSI in August 2020, she weighed her options for retiring the \ndelinquent debt. She exercised sound judgment and financial responsibility by obtaining \nthe Chapter 7 discharge before the SOR was issued in August 2021. She is resuming \nher education to achieve a degree in business management. Considering this case in \nlight of the the specific conditions and the general factors of the whole-person concept, \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns emanating from the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Guideline E, personal conduct \nwas refuted. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 29, 2022, the Department of Defense issued to Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, \nGuideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline I, psychological conditions. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 17, 2022, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n1 \n\nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on October 27, \n2022. She was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 4 through 7 (Item 1 is the SOR and Items 2 and 3 are \nadministrative documents). Applicant did not respond to the FORM, provide documentary \nevidence, or object to the Government\u2019s evidence. The Government\u2019s evidence is \ntherefore admitted. The case was assigned to me on January 27, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 60 years old. She was married from 1988 to 1993. She remarried in \n2020. She has an adult daughter. She has been employed by a federal contractor since \nAugust 2019. \nIn approximately May 2016, Applicant recognized she had issues with alcohol and \nbegan attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Between May 2016 and late 2017, she \nrelapsed about once a quarter by drinking one to two bottles of wine on each occasion. \nShe then abstained from alcohol consumption between late 2017 and March 2019. (Item \n6) \nIn March 2019, while working at a military retail facility on a military base, Applicant \nconsumed three small bottles of wine that she had brought to work with her in her purse. \nShe told the investigator that she had been under a lot of stress due to her upcoming \nwedding and because she was offended that one of her co-workers wore his pants low, \nand she was able to see his buttocks. She had previously registered a complaint with her \nmanager about how her coworkers dressed but was told there was nothing that could be \ndone about it. Applicant became intoxicated while at work. A coworker approached and \ntold her she was being relieved from her shift. Applicant went home because she was \nintoxicated. She told the investigator that the next day she contacted her manager and \ntold him she was resigning from her position because she was a recovering alcoholic and \nshe had relapsed. She said she would not be returning to work because she needed to \nfocus on herself and her recovery. Her manager agreed with her, and she never returned \nto work. She denied she was fired. (Item 6) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in August 2019. She did not \ndisclose that she left her position in May 2019 after being relieved from her shift for being \nintoxicated, and then resigned. (Item 4) \nIn October 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. During \nher interview, she disclosed that in 2013, she had gastric-bypass surgery. Around that \ntime, she began consuming alcohol. She said she replaced her food addiction with alcohol \naddiction. Her father passed away in 2013. Due to grief, loneliness, and stress, she began \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsuming one to two bottles of wine a day and became intoxicated each time. She would \noccasionally have hallucinations while intoxicated. (Items 6 and 7) \nApplicant was asked by the government investigator why she failed to disclose that \nshe left her employment in March 2019 due to her alcohol incident and relapse, and she \nsaid she was embarrassed. She admitted that alcohol had a negative impact on her \nprofessional life because she had to leave her position. Her alcohol consumption \nimpacted her relationship with her daughter and her daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Her daughter \nbought breathalyzers to monitor Applicant\u2019s consumption. She told the investigator that \nshe will always be a recovering alcoholic, and she will continue to attend AA meetings. \n(Item 6) \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has participated in alcohol counseling, but she \nreported to the investigator that she attended AA in May 2016 until August 2019 twice a \nday, and she reported that she attended about three times a week from August 2019 to \nOctober 2019. During her interview with the government investigator, she stated she had \nbeen sober since August 2019. In May 2022, Applicant completed government \ninterrogatories and confirmed the accuracy of her statement to the investigator. She did \nnot provide any updated information about whether she continues to attend AA; whether \nshe has sought alcohol counseling; whether she has continually abstained from alcohol \nconsumption; and whether she has had any relapses. (Item 6) \nIn October 2020, Applicant was evaluated by a government-approved, licensed \npsychologist, Dr. L. Applicant disclosed to the psychologist that she had a history of \ndepression and had attempted suicide twice in the past three years. Her first attempt in \n2017 involved an overdose of pills, and she was taken to the hospital by ambulance. The \nsecond attempt was after she lost her job in 2019 for drinking alcohol. She reported that \nshe attempted to slice her wrists, which required a home visit from a mental health \nagency. The psychologist noted that Applicant reported that she had been diagnosed with \ndepression in the past and was presently prescribed psychotropic medications. She \nreceives medicine management through her general physician, though at the time of her \npsychological evaluation, she had been referred to a psychiatrist, whom she had not yet \nseen. Applicant also reported that she had been in recovery from alcohol use for \napproximately 18-19 months. She described her support in managing her alcohol \naddiction was through AA and her husband and daughter. (Item 7) \nDr. L diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder (moderate) and alcohol \nabuse disorder, in remission. Her psychological evaluation noted that Applicant had \npersistent mental health issues and potential neurocognitive challenges that warranted \nconcern about her overall functioning. Dr. L noted that Applicant\u2019s issue with her mood \nappears to be influenced by complicated and unprocessed grief surrounding her father\u2019s \npassing. In addition, Dr. L opined that while Applicant\u2019s alcohol addiction is in sustained \nremission, Applicant continued to demonstrate limited coping capacity to manage \npsychosocial stressors. As such, her risk for relapse and emotional dysregulation in \nresponse to situational stressors in her environment remained a concern. (Item 7) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDr. L also noted that Applicant failed to disclose her mental health issues and \naddiction issues on her SCA. Applicant reported to the government investigator that she \nwas embarrassed about her alcohol issues. Dr. L opined that her embarrassment is \nconsistent with Applicant\u2019s immense shame surrounding her mental health and recovery. \nShe stated that her level of shame and associated vulnerability warrant concern around \npotential implications as it pertains to holding a security clearance, as Applicant\u2019s lack of \ncandor and forthcomingness indicate unprocessed issues that may make her susceptible \nto manipulation. (Item 7) \nDr. L opined that Applicant\u2019s current level of functioning may interfere with her \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She also noted that Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse \nwas being managed presently with a prolonged period of sobriety and consistent \nengagement in AA. (Item 7) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n4 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety others, regardless of whether the individual was \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \nIn March 2019 Applicant consumed alcohol at work, became intoxicated, and was \nsent home. The next day she spoke with her manager and resigned from her job. She \nadmitted she is an alcoholic and has had several relapses from 2016 to 2019. In October \n2020, Applicant was diagnosed by Dr. L, a qualified clinical psychologist, with alcohol use \ndisorder in remission. Dr. L opined that while Applicant\u2019s alcohol addiction is in sustained \nremission, she continues to demonstrate limited coping capacity to manage psychosocial \nstressors. As such, her risk for relapse and emotional dysregulation in response to \nsituational stressors in her environment remains a concern. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n  \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nApplicant has had an alcohol problem since 2013. She has attended AA and has \nthe support of her husband and daughter. She told the government investigator that she \nrelapsed quarterly from May 2016 until late 2017. She continued going to AA. She \nrelapsed again in March 2019, when she was experiencing stress due to her upcoming \nwedding and from a coworker\u2019s attire. Applicant disclosed her alcohol issues to the \ngovernment investigator in October 2019 and Dr. L in October 2020. In June 2022, she \ncertified through her interrogatories that the information she told the government \ninvestigator was accurate. She did not provide any updated information as to the status \nof her recovery or if she has experienced any more recent relapses. She did not provide \ninformation as to whether she is attending alcohol counseling; whether she continues to \nattend AA; or whether she pursued other counseling regarding her alcohol or other mental \nhealth issues. She did not provide any information in response to the FORM. The most \ncurrent information about her alcohol abuse is from her psychological evaluation with Dr. \nL in October 2020. I am unable to conclude without more recent information that she has \nhad an extended period of sobriety and a future relapse is unlikely to recur. I find the \nabove mitigating conditions do not apply. \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may\nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not\nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative,\nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n \n \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant was evaluated by a DOD-approved licensed psychologist, Dr. L, in \nOctober 2020. Dr. L diagnosed her with major depressive disorder (moderate) and alcohol \nabuse disorder, in remission. Applicant\u2019s psychological evaluation noted that she has \nbeen dealing with depression since approximately 1988 and since then she has had bouts \nof depressive symptoms and suicide ideations. She attempted suicide in 2017 and again \nin 2019. She also had an alcohol relapse while at work in May 2019. Applicant takes \npsychotropic medication. Dr. L noted that Applicant has not been able to deal with her \nproblems since her father passed away in 2013. Dr. L opined that Applicant\u2019s mood issues \nseem to be influenced by complicated and unprocessed grief. Her persistent mental \nhealth issues and potential neurocognitive challenges warrant concern about Applicant\u2019s \noverall functioning. Dr. L opined that Applicant\u2019s current level of functioning may interfere \nwith her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that any of the above \nmitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying. \nI find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant failed to disclose in her August 2019 SCA that she had resigned from \nher position after being relieved by a coworker and sent home from work after she was \nconsuming alcohol on the job. There is insufficient evidence that she left her job by mutual \nagreement. She likely may have been fired for her actions, but the evidence does not \nreflect that happened. The evidence does not support the above disqualifying condition. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G, I, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline I, psychological \nconditions. The alleged security concern under Guideline E, personal conduct, was \nrefuted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He had been serving in an unspecified position since sometime after April 2020 when he submitted his SF 86. In February 2023, the FSO of his original employer informed me that Applicant was no longer employed by the company. Shortly thereafter, Department Counsel informed me that Applicant was now sponsored by a new employer. Applicant was consistently employed by other employers in a variety of full-time and part-time positions since September 1998. He never served with the U.S. military. He initially reported not having attended any schools in the ten years before 2020, but he subsequently acknowledged that he had attended ITT Technical Institute from 2008 until 2013. He denied having received a degree or diploma during the ten years before 2020. He was granted a secret clearance in 2014. He was married in 2017. He has no children.

On December 3, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn February 26, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 13, 2022, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on July 23, 2022. His response was due on August 22, 2022, and the record \nclosed on that date. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of September 7, \n2022, no response had been received. The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2022. \nOn October 14, 2022, I issued a Decision in which I concluded that Applicant had \nmitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and granted his \neligibility for a security clearance. \nThe Government appealed the favorable decision to the DOHA Appeal Board \nalleging error by the Administrative Judge and seeking reversal of the decision. On \nJanuary 10, 2023, the Appeal Board remanded the decision back to me, ruling that I had \nerred when I sua sponte obtained, considered, and relied upon non-record evidence from \nnon-authoritative sources (newspaper articles) which I did not enter into the record \nwithout giving the parties notice of my intent and the opportunity to respond. I \nacknowledge that I should have entered copies of the newspaper articles into the record, \nnot simply by citing the Internet Uniform Resource Locator (URL) but also by failing to \nenter the authoritative sources for the information cited. The Appeal Board concluded that \nthe best resolution was to remand this case for the Judge to reopen the record, provide \nthe parties any documents on which he intends to rely for taking administrative notice, \nand give them an opportunity to submit additional evidence or argument. \nBy Case Management Order, dated February 9, 2023, I furnished the parties \ncopies of the following reliable source documents that I intended to use when\nreconsidering my Remand Decision: Exhibit 1 (Department of Education Press Release,\ndated August 16, 2022); Exhibit 2 (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Press Release,\ndated September 15, 2020); Exhibit 3 (The Washington Post Article, dated September\n15, 2020); and Exhibit 4 (Stipulated Final Judgment and Order, issued by Judge James\nR. Sweeney, II, of the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana, dated\nOctober 1, 2020). The record in this case was reopened to enable the parties to consider\nthose materials and they were given the opportunity to re-shape their evidence and\narguments. Copies of new exhibits and argument the Department Counsel and the\nApplicant intended to offer were required to be provided to the Administrative Judge and\nto each other by 12:00 noon, Thursday, March 2, 2023.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel timely responded (by submitting a new exhibit, a credit report \nmarked and admitted as Item 10, as well as a memorandum containing her argument). \nApplicant did not respond even though his new facility security officer (FSO) informed him \nof the process and the fact that a Case Management Order had been issued.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.p.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He had been serving \nin an unspecified position since sometime after April 2020 when he submitted his SF 86. \nIn February 2023, the FSO of his original employer informed me that Applicant was no \nlonger employed by the company. Shortly thereafter, Department Counsel informed me \nthat Applicant was now sponsored by a new employer. Applicant was consistently \nemployed by other employers in a variety of full-time and part-time positions since \nSeptember 1998. He never served with the U.S. military. He initially reported not having \nattended any schools in the ten years before 2020, but he subsequently acknowledged \nthat he had attended ITT Technical Institute from 2008 until 2013. He denied having \nreceived a degree or diploma during the ten years before 2020. He was granted a secret \nclearance in 2014. He was married in 2017. He has no children. \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 8 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated February 5, 2014); Item 7 (DOD Continuous Evaluation \nProgram (CEP) Incident Report, dated February 11, 2020); Item 3 (SF 86, dated April 2, \n2020); Item 9 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated September 24, 2020); Item 5 (Verate \nCredit Report, dated March 10, 2021); Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated February 26, \n2022); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 5, 2022); and Item 10 (Equifax Credit \nReport, dated February 27, 2023. \nIn his SF 86, Applicant denied having any financial issues associated with \ndelinquent accounts. (Item 2 at 32-33) On September 24, 2020, he was interviewed by \nan investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that \ninterview, he disclosed that he had been having difficulties completing his SF 86 and while \nhe was attempting to make corrections, he forgot to update the section with respect to his \neducational loans. He described the problems he had been having with ITT Technical \nInstitute \u2013 the school he was attending \u2013 and he reported that the financial aid office had \nto locate additional funds for him to remain in school. The result was that in addition to \nhis 12 student loans with the U.S. Department of Education, he had 2 student loans from \nanother lender.

(Item 5 at 2-4; Item 6 at 15-20; Item 10 at 4-10) In 2020, Applicant \nmade some payments in the amount of $190.45 each to the U.S. Department of \nEducation, by wage garnishments, all of which were applied to interest, fees, and other \ncharges. In 2022, he made a $50 payment that was applied to interest. (Payment History \nattached to Answer to SOR) According to his most recent credit report, in January 2023, \nhe reportedly paid the account as agreed and made one or more unspecified payments \nto several accounts, and is not past due. (Item 10 at 4-6) Further discussion regarding \nthese accounts appears below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o. and 1.p. refer to student loan accounts with another lender \u2013 PEAKS \n\u2013 the other lender \u201cfound by the school\u201d with unpaid balances of $3,295 and $2,501 that \nwere placed for collection and charged off. (Item 6 at 21) Because the account numbers \nreflected in the various credit reports are inconsistent, it is nearly impossible to match \naccounts up between credit reports of different years. Further discussion regarding these \naccounts appears below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n. refers to a charge account with an unpaid balance of $2,167 that was \nplaced for collection. (Item 5 at 4) On February 23, 2022, Applicant paid the creditor\n$2,167.65, and there is now a zero balance. (Receipt attached to Answer to SOR) The \naccount has been resolved.  \n \nITT Technical Institute (ITT Tech) \nITT Tech was considered a predatory for-profit college, and PEAKS, its holding \ncompany, would offer students tuition costs through private loans. A lawsuit was filed after \nITT Tech \u2013 the university that Applicant attended and generated extensive student loans \n\u2013 entered bankruptcy and closed its 137 campuses in 2016. After the school\u2019s closure, \nhundreds of thousands of students were still required to pay for their outstanding student \nloans. A 2018 lawsuit settlement forgave $600 million that 750,000 students owed to the \nschool. In June 2019, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reached a \nsettlement with ITT Tech that discharged about $168 million in private student loans. In \nAugust 2019, an additional settlement was reached, including a judgment against ITT \nTech for $60 million and an injunction that prohibited ITT Tech from offering student loans \nin the future. In September 2020, the CFPB reached another settlement, requiring ITT \nTech to forgive $330 Million in outstanding student loan balances. In total, ITT Tech \nerased more than $500 million in private student loan debt. As noted by a press release \nby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Washington Post on September \n15, 2020: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForty-eight state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau have secured more than $330 million in private student-loan \nforgiveness for 35,000 former students of ITT Technical Institute. \nA judgment order entered Tuesday puts to rest a 2014 lawsuit accusing the \ndefunct for-profit chain of steering students into predatory loans. PEAKS \nTrust, a private loan program run by ITT Tech and affiliated with Deutsche \nBank entities, has agreed to forgo the collection of the outstanding \neducation debt from ITT Tech students. It will also ask credit-reporting \nagencies to delete references to those loans from the credit reports of \naffected borrowers. \nEligible borrowers will be notified by PEAKS or their loan servicer and need \nto do nothing to receive forgiveness. At least 1,100 former ITT Tech \nstudents in Maryland will receive relief, while 1,840 borrowers in Virginia will \nhave their private loans canceled. \n\u201cMaryland students were deceived when they were pressured into taking on \nthese predatory loans,\u201d Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) said \nin a statement Tuesday. \u201cPEAKS will be required by this settlement to \nprovide debt relief to Maryland students who we allege were misled while \nthey were working hard to further their education.\u201d \nITT Tech created two in-house student-loan programs as private lenders \nretreated from the market at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Banks \nstopped extending credit to students at for-profit colleges, because of their \nhistorically high default rates. \nITT Tech issued students \u201ctemporary credits\u201d to cover remaining tuition after \nfederal and private student loans were taken into account. Some former \nstudents said the credits were marketed as grants, while others said they \nwere told the credit would not have to be repaid until six months after \ngraduation. But when the temporary credit became due, ITT Tech allegedly \npressured students into accepting loans with double-digit interest rates from \nPEAKS. \nAccording to the complaint, students said they were pulled out of class or \nthreatened with expulsion if they refused to accept the loan terms. Many of \nthe former students lacked the means to continue their education and said \nthey felt there were no other options than to accept the loans. Eighty percent \nof the loans fell into default as students could not keep up with payments. \nEven as students began defaulting in great numbers around 2011, ITT Tech \ncontinued issuing the high-cost loans. The tactics landed the company\u2019s top \nbrass in the crosshairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The \nfederal agency settled fraud cases in 2018 against former ITT chief \nexecutive Kevin Modany and former chief financial officer Daniel Fitzpatrick \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor allegedly deceiving investors about high rates of late payments and \ndefaults on student loans backed by the company. \nThe SEC said executives made secret payments on delinquent accounts to \ndelay defaults instead of disclosing the tens of millions of dollars in \nimpending losses to investors. Executives assured investors in conference \ncalls that the programs were performing well, while ITT\u2019s obligations to pay \nout on soured loans began to balloon, according to that complaint. \nBefore shutting down in 2016, ITT Tech was being investigated by more\nthan a dozen state attorneys general and two federal agencies for alleged\nfraud, deceptive marketing or steering students into predatory loans. That\nlegal morass led an accrediting body to threaten to end its relationship with\nthe chain, which resulted in the Education Department curtailing ITT\u2019s\naccess to federal student aid. \n \n \n \n \n \nDays after closing and leaving 35,000 students and 8,000 employees in the \nlurch, the company filed for bankruptcy protection to liquidate its business. \n(Ex. 2; Ex 3)  \nA more recent update took place on August 16, 2022: \nToday, the U.S. Department of Education . . . announced that it will \ndischarge all remaining federal student loans that borrowers received to \nattend [ITT Tech] from January 1, 2005, through its closure in September \n2016. The decision, which follows Departmental findings based on \nextensive internal records, testimony from [ITT Tech] managers and \nrecruiters, and first-hand accounts from borrowers, will result in 208,000 \nborrowers receiving $3.9 billion in full loan discharges. This includes \nborrowers who have not yet applied for a borrower defense < Caution-\nhttps://studentaid.gov/borrower-defense/ >  to repayment discharge. These \nborrowers will have the federal student loans they received to attend [ITT \nTech] discharged without any additional action on their part. \n\"It is time for student borrowers to stop shouldering the burden from [ITT \nTech]'s years of lies and false promises,\" said U.S. Secretary of Education \nMiguel Cardona. \"The evidence shows that for years, [ITT Tech]'s leaders \nintentionally misled students about the quality of their programs in order to \nprofit off federal student loan programs, with no regard for the hardship this \nwould cause.  The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to stand up for \nborrowers who've been cheated by their colleges, while working to \nstrengthen oversight and enforcement to protect today's students from \nsimilar deception and abuse.\" \nToday's action brings the total amount of loan relief approved by the Biden-\nHarris Administration to nearly $32 billion for 1.6 million borrowers. This \nincludes $13 billion related to institutions that took advantage of borrowers. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt represents the Department's continued commitment to providing debt \nrelief to eligible borrowers. \nToday's [ITT Tech] announcement builds on the Administration's previous \nactions related to [ITT Tech], which has resulted in the approval of $1.9 \nbillion in discharges for 130,000 students to date. This includes borrower \ndefense findings that [ITT Tech] engaged in widespread and pervasive \nmisrepresentations related to the ability of students to get a job or transfer\ncredits, and lying about the programmatic accreditation of [ITT Tech]'s\nassociate degree in nursing. Separately, the Department announced an \nexpanded window for borrowers who attended but did not graduate from \n[ITT Tech] to receive closed school discharges. \n \n \n\"[ITT Tech] defrauded hundreds of thousands of students, as we identified \nwhen I was the director of the [CFPB],\" said Federal Student Aid Chief \nRichard Cordray. \"By delivering the loan relief students deserve, we are \ngiving them the opportunity to resume their educational journey without the \nunfair burden of student debt they are carrying from a dishonest institution.\" \nThe Department's findings around [ITT Tech] were assisted by significant \nand extensive work by attorneys general across the country, the [CFPB], \nand Veterans Education Success. The Department received important \nevidence from half the country's state offices of attorneys general, led by \nColorado and Oregon Attorneys General and supported by significant \nevidence from the Iowa and New Mexico Attorneys General. \nThe Department's findings are based on extensive evidence, including \ninternal [ITT Tech] policies and records; recruitment materials and \nbrochures; recordings of interactions between [ITT Tech]'s representatives \nand prospective students; testimony from former students, employees, and \nadministrators; investigative files and submissions from congressional \ninvestigators and state offices of attorneys general; and the tens of \nthousands of individual borrower defense applications submitted by former \n[ITT Tech] students. . . . \n\"The automatic loan cancellation announced today will provide life-changing \nrelief that has long been owed to former [ITT Tech] students,\" said Rohit \nChopra, director of the CFPB. \"Far too many Americans are still on the hook \nfor loans they acquired at colleges that profited from deceiving students, \nand the CFPB will continue to work with the Department of Education to \naddress predatory student loan debt, to protect students, and to hold \nwrongdoers accountable.\" \n(Ex. 1) \nIn addition, on October 1, 2020, a Stipulated Final Judgment and Order was issued \nin the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Indiana, regarding PEAKS. (Ex. 4) \nDepartment Counsel has conceded that as of March 2, 2023, the student loans are no \nlonger delinquent.

(Supplement \u2013 File of \nRelevant Material, at 3, 5) While she is essentially correct in her assessment, in this \ninstance there is no application of the law as associated with the statute of limitations. \nAlso, she cites President Biden\u2019s pause on student loan collection efforts \u2013 placing them \nin a deferment status \u2013 as not constituting an excuse for past inactions in the context of \nsecurity clearance eligibility. (Supplement \u2013 File of Relevant Material, at 6) Nevertheless, \nbased on all of the above, Applicant is no longer legally responsible for the student loans \ngenerated by ITT Tech and PEAKS \u2013 not because of a statute of limitations defense or a \nCOVID-19 pause in collection efforts \u2013  but because those loans were essentially the \nresult of \u201cyears of lies and false promises\u201d in \u201cintentionally [misleading] students\u201d \notherwise referred to as consumer fraud. (Ex. 1 at 1) Department Counsel\u2019s argument \nthat Applicant\u2019s failure to take more aggressive and timely action by paying the \u201cillegal\u201d \nloans rather than waiting for other corrective action, is not persuasive. It appears that the \nloans have been declared null and void. \nWhen Applicant completed his application for student loan rehabilitation (rather \nthan forgiveness) in March 2022, he reported approximately $2,380 in monthly income \nand approximately $2,134 in monthly household expenses, leaving a monthly remainder \nof about $246 available for savings or spending. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s most recent \ncredit report \u2013 the one dated February 27, 2023 \u2013 submitted by Department Counsel, \nreflects zero delinquent accounts, while reporting inconsistent entries regarding the \nstudent loans. In the absence of the student loans and the resolution of the delinquent \ncharge account, there is clear evidence to indicate that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nnow under control, and he is currently in a much better position financially than he had \nbeen. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in April 2008, which was discharged in \nabout July 2013, as well as 15 still-delinquent accounts, of which the 14 student loans \ntotaled approximately $101,248, and the remaining charge account totaled $2,167. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence to indicate an \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of an ability to do so. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. As noted above, Applicant\u2019s Chapter \n13 Bankruptcy (not Chapter 7, as initially argued by Department Counsel) was filed in \nApril 2008 and discharged nearly a decade ago. Under Chapter 13, a debtor makes \npayments through the Trustee to the creditors. It is a process where the debtor does not \navoid paying his debts, but rather one in which the debtor receives guidance in \nreorganizing his debts and paying them with the assistance of a bankruptcy trustee. There \nis no apparent connection between that bankruptcy and the student-loans issue. \nIn this instance, in an effort to rehabilitate his student loans, Applicant started the \nrehabilitation process and made some payments. Applicant was clearly the victim of ITT \nTech \u2013 a predatory for-profit college \u2013 and its fraudulent lending practices. The attorney \ngenerals of 48 states and the CFPB went after that college and its holding company to \nextract justice for the defrauded students. Applicant\u2019s delayed and incomplete resolution \nattempts in such an environment should not be considered an unreasonable response. \nHis actions do not reflect irresponsible character and evidence of poor judgment, poor \nreliability, and poor trustworthiness. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere \nis \nsome \ndisqualifying \nevidence \nregarding \nApplicant\u2019s \nfinancial \nconsiderations. He filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in April 2008, which was discharged \nin about July 2013. In addition, the SOR alleged 15 still-delinquent accounts, of which the \n14 student loans totaled approximately $101,248, and the remaining unpaid charge \naccount totaled $2,167. Other than several minor payments, Applicant delayed or made \nincomplete efforts to resolve his delinquent student-loan accounts. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial \nconsiderations. Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He had been \nserving in an unspecified position since sometime after April 2020 when he submitted his \nSF 86. By February 2023, he was no longer with that employer and was now employed \nby another company in an unspecified position. He was consistently employed by other \nemployers in a variety of full-time and part-time positions since September 1998. He \nattended ITT Tech from 2008 until 2013, but received no degree. He was granted a secret \nclearance in 2014. He was married in 2017. Although he filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy \nin 2008, that bankruptcy was discharged in July 2013, after he complied with the \nrequirements of the Bankruptcy Trustee. \nAside from the questionable delinquent student-loan accounts, he resolved the \nonly other delinquent account in his name. Forty-eight state attorneys general and the \nCFPB have secured hundreds of millions in private student-loan forgiveness for \nthousands of former students of ITT Tech. Applicant was clearly one of the consumer \nfraud victims of ITT Tech \u2013 a predatory for-profit college \u2013 and its illegal lending practices. \nThere are no longer lingering questions if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been, as well as any continuing doubt about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude \nApplicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.p.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 61-year-old part-time training coordinator employed by a defense contractor since November 2008. He also works full time as a city firefighter. He has a high-school education. He married in May 1988 and has one child. He has held a security clearance since August 2006. The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file federal income tax returns as required for tax year 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and tax years 2009 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he failed to file state income tax returns as required for tax years, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It also alleges that he owes about $18,645 in federal taxes for tax years 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant testified that he has not had any income as a defense contractor since COVID. As a city firefighter, he earns about $2,200 per month. (Tr. 16) He also works intermittently as a logistician for another government agency. His federal income tax return for 2021 reflected total wages of $129,874.

He did not \nsubmit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until May 19, 2023, to enable \nhim to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \nthrough E, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nMay 15, 2023. The record closed on May 19, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations with explanations. \nHis admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 61-year-old part-time training coordinator employed by a defense \ncontractor since November 2008. He also works full time as a city firefighter. He has a \nhigh-school education. He married in May 1988 and has one child. He has held a security \nclearance since August 2006. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file federal income tax returns as required \nfor tax year 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and tax years 2009 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he \nfailed to file state income tax returns as required for tax years, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, \nand 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It also alleges that he owes about $18,645 in federal taxes for tax \nyears 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nApplicant testified that he has not had any income as a defense contractor since \nCOVID. As a city firefighter, he earns about $2,200 per month. (Tr. 16) He also works \nintermittently as a logistician for another government agency. His federal income tax \nreturn for 2021 reflected total wages of $129,874. (AX E) \nApplicant\u2019s wife is employed as the office manager for a dentist. Her pay varies \nbetween $1,200 and $1,600 per month. (Tr. 57) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that his wife handles the family \nfinances, including their taxes. He was unaware that his wife began suffering from \ndepression and had not filed their tax returns or paid the taxes due. His wife is now taking \nmedication and receiving therapy. She testified that she first began dealing with \ndepression when her mother passed away in 1993. She was able to control her \ndepression until her father passed away in 2006. She testified that when she is frightened, \nshe stops functioning. After trying different medications, she stabilized around 2010 or \n2011. (Tr. 60, 64) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that, in 2016 or 2017, she retained someone who \nrepresented himself as a tax professional. About a year and a half ago, she found out that \nthis person had not taken the necessary steps to rectify their financial problems.

(AX A) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file federal and state \ntax returns are numerous, recent, and were not due to conditions making recurrence \nunlikely. His federal tax debt is recent, ongoing, and was not due to conditions making \nrecurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. The periods of depression suffered by \nApplicant\u2019s wife were conditions largely beyond his control, but she testified that her \ncondition stabilized in 2010 or 2011. The inaction of a purported tax professional hired in \n2016 or 2017 also was a condition beyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, he has not acted \nresponsibly. His pay was garnished in 2013 for delinquent state income taxes. \nNevertheless, he paid no attention to his tax obligations until he submitted his SCA in \nNovember 2016. Even after submitting his SCA, he continued his repeated failures to \ntimely file federal and state income tax returns. He did not enter into a payment agreement \nfor his delinquent federal taxes until May 2023. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. Applicant did not file his past-due tax returns \nuntil he realized that his security clearance was in jeopardy. The fact that Applicant has \nfiled his past-due returns \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness based on longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). Actions motivated by the pressure of qualifying \nfor a security clearance do not demonstrate \u201cgood faith.\u201d Applicants who begin to address \ntheir security-significant conduct only when their personal interests are at stake may be \nlacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established for the past-due federal and state returns that have been \nfiled. It is not established for the federal tax debt.

Sep. 26, 2019). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere and candid at the \nhearing, but he did not display any sense of urgency in resolving his tax issues. Even \nafter being put on notice that his security clearance is at risk, he still has not significantly \nincreased his involvement in family finances. At the hearing, he repeatedly deferred \nfinancial questions to his wife, indicating his continued lack of involvement in family \nfinancial matters. I am not confident that his tax problems will not recur. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns \nand pay the taxes due. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs \u00b6 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the three SOR allegations, all with explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 46 years old. He has several years of college, but no degree. He joined the Army at age 17, and served from 1994 to 2016, retiring as a sergeant first class. He has held a clearance since joining the Army. (GE 1) Applicant\u2019s Army service included several deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq, among other overseas assignments. He was awarded numerous decorations and medals, including a Bronze Star, four Army Commendation Medals, four Army Achievement Medals, multiple unit awards including a Presidential Unit Citation, seven Good Conduct medals, an Afghanistan Campaign Medal (two campaign stars), an Iraq Campaign Medal (five campaign stars), along with numerous service awards and badges. (AE D; Tr. 58-59) After retiring from the Army, Applicant worked as a forklift driver for six months in early 2017. He was then briefly unemployed before spending about two years with his next employer, from 2017 to 2019. He then worked for a federal contractor from March 2019 to March 2020, and he has worked for his current employer and clearance 2 sponsor since March 2020. He lives in State 1, but works in a neighboring state, State 2. (GE 1; AE K; Tr. 8, 19-22, 27-30, 58) Applicant was previously married from 200",

(AE D; Tr. 58-59) \nAfter retiring from the Army, Applicant worked as a forklift driver for six months in \nearly 2017. He was then briefly unemployed before spending about two years with his \nnext employer, from 2017 to 2019.

He lives in State 1, but works in a neighboring state, State \n2. (GE 1; AE K; Tr. 8, 19-22, 27-30, 58) \nApplicant was previously married from 2005 to 2016. The marriage produced two \ndaughters, ages 21 and 13. He has a 12-year-old daughter from another relationship. \nHe remarried in 2016. He is stepfather to his wife\u2019s three grown children. Two of his \nchildren live with him. His wife owns a beauty salon and works for a major airline. (GE 1; \nTr. 18-19, 69-70) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal income tax returns for tax \nyears (TY) 2012 and 2016 to 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) It also alleges his failure to file state \nincome tax returns for TY 2016 to 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) It also alleges that he owes past-\ndue federal taxes of about $8,370 for TY 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nOn his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed several years of \nunfiled federal income tax returns. He asserted that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have the necessary \npaperwork.\u201d He noted that he had retained a financial manager. He disclosed other \ndebts, most notably $29,000 in past-due child support, and addressed how they were \nbeing resolved. (GE 1 at 46-50) He discussed his tax issues further in an April 2021 \nbackground interview. (GE 2 at 10-11) \nIn a September 2021 interrogatory response about his taxes and debts, Applicant \nprovided federal income tax transcripts from the IRS, details about his state income tax \nreturns, along with general information about his financial status. This information, and \nhis prior disclosures on the SCA, largely establish the SOR allegations. (GE 1, GE 2 at \n16, 18, 20, 24-27) \nApplicant was deployed to a combat zone in Afghanistan from November 2012 to \nthe fall of 2013. His typical practice when deployed was to file his income tax returns \nwhen he returned from deployment, but he failed to do so for TY 2012. (SOR \u00b6 1.a, in \npart) His return from this deployment was particularly difficult, as several of the soldiers \nin his unit had been killed in combat and others committed suicide after returning home. \nApplicant said he was focused on his own well-being and that of his soldiers. He said \nfiling his income tax return \u201cjust slipped my mind.\u201d (Answer; Tr. 24-26, 38-39, 42) He \nrealized that his TY 2012 income tax return was unfiled while responding to the \ninterrogatories. He filed the federal income tax return for TY 2012 in December 2021. It \nreflects that he owed $562 (not including penalties and interest), which he subsequently \npaid. (AE F, AE H, Tr. 26, 45-47, 65-66) \nApplicant also failed to file his federal and state income tax returns, where \napplicable, for TY 2016 to 2019. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c) In 2017, when his TY 2016 federal \nincome tax return was due, he was adjusting to civilian life after retiring from the Army. \nHe was also pursing suitable civilian employment, and he had many out-of-state VA \ndoctor visits that year. This was complicated by the fact that his disability assessment \nby the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was not completed until 2018. (Answer; \nTr. 28-29, 43-45, 66, 81) In 2017, he was also making a limited income of about $700 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevery two weeks, which was several thousand dollars less than he had earned in the \nArmy. He could not afford to pay the taxes he owed, and he chose to prioritize providing \nfor his family. (Tr. 30-32, 80) In 2018, his income improved as he worked as an aviation \ninspector, earning about $57,500. In 2019, he began working for a government \ncontractor and earned almost $78,000. (Tr. 32-33) He asserted, however, that he still \nprioritized providing for his family and catching up on unpaid bills rather than focusing \non his tax issues. (Tr. 43-44) \nBeginning in May 2020, Applicant consulted a financial counselor at his place of \nemployment, for assistance in rebuilding his credit, repaying his creditors, and sorting \nout his unfiled tax returns. He was advised to pay delinquent household debts and get \nthem in order before addressing his tax situation. He said he was also advised during \nhis background interview to resolve his delinquent debts as soon as possible, which he \ndid. (Answer; GE 3, GE 4, AE L; Tr. 33-35, 40-42, 67-69, 72-74, 78-80) \nApplicant also retained a tax preparer to help address his late-filed returns. The \ntax preparer filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2016 to 2019 in November 2021. \nHe filed his various state income tax returns in July 2021, with one earlier exception. All \nreturns for subsequent tax years have been prepared by the tax preparation firm. (Tr. \n36, 45; AE G, AE H, AE O) \nFor TY 2016, Applicant owed $1,437 in federal taxes, which he subsequently \npaid. (AE G, part i, AE H) From TY 2012 through TY 2016, Applicant was on active duty \nand his \u201chome of record\u201d was in State 3, where he did not have to pay state income \ntaxes or file a state income tax return, even though he was stationed elsewhere. He \nreported this in his interrogatory response, where he wrote \u201cN/A\u201d in reporting the state \nincome tax return filing status for those tax years. He also confirmed that information in \nhis testimony. (GE 2 at 18; Tr. 54, 60-61) This evidence is sufficient to rebut the \nallegation of an unfiled state income tax return for TY 2016. (SOR \u00b6 1.b, in part). \nFor TY 2017, Applicant owed $440 in federal taxes, which he subsequently paid. \n(AE G, part ii, AE U) His TY 2017 State 1 income tax return reflects that he owed $826 \n(not including penalties and interest), which he subsequently paid. (AE G, part ii, AE O, \npart i, AE V) \nFor TY 2018, Applicant owed $4,666 in federal taxes, which he subsequently \npaid. (AE G, part iii, AE P, AE T) His TY 2018 State 1 income tax return, filed in May \n2022, reflects that he owed $2,639 (not including penalties and interest). (AE G, part iii, \nAE O, part ii) He documented a payment of $1,065. (AE H, AE P; Tr. 46-50, 55-56) \nFor TY 2019, he owed $189 in federal taxes, which he subsequently paid. (AE G, \npart iv, AE H, AE S) He said he did not pay penalties and interest for any of these past-\ndue income taxes and was not aware if he had to do so. He paid what he thought he \nowed.

When he began working there, he would work in State 2 during the week, \nand go home to State 1 on weekends. The COVID pandemic began shortly after he \nstarted working for with his current employer, in March 2020, so since then he often \nworks from home (in State 1) or travels for work to remote sites. (Tr. 62-65) As a result \nof his work in State 2, he has also been required to file a state income tax return there. \nFor TY 2019, Applicant\u2019s State 1 and State 2 income tax returns were prepared \nand filed by his tax preparer in July 2023. He received a $170 refund (not including \npenalties and interest) from State 2, and he owed $945 to State 1, which he \nsubsequently paid. (AE H, AE O, part iii; AE W; Tr. 56-57) \nTax filings for later tax years are not alleged in the SOR. Applicant filed his TY \n2020 federal income tax return on or about August 16, 2021. (GE 2 at 30) He owed \n$8,370 in federal taxes for TY 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1,c),but he paid the debt in full. (GE 2 at \n17, 30, 38; SOR Ex. 2; AE M, AE N) He made some payments before the SOR was \nissued. (SOR Ex. 2; Tr. 37-38, 50-51) After over $8,000 in payments in October 2021, \nand calculation of about $100 in penalties and interest, he received a $31 refund in \nAugust 2022. (AE X) \nApplicant provided a TY 2020 income tax return for State 1. It is dated July 21, \n2023, but it is unsigned and incomplete. No federal income, from which state income is \ncalculated, is reflected. (Tr. 37, 57-58; AE O, part iv) No State 2 income tax return for \nTY 2020 was provided. \nApplicant said he filed his TY 2021 federal income tax return in September 2022 \nby mail. He estimated that he owed about $3,400, to be withdrawn from his bank \naccount. He said the return was not accepted due to a dispute with his ex-wife over who \ncan claim their eldest daughter as a dependent. This dispute is ongoing. He said he \nmay have to pay an additional $1,200 or so and is able and willing to do so. (Tr. 51-54, \n70, 77) Applicant\u2019s TY 2021 State 2 income tax return was prepared by the tax service \nin May 2022. It reflects a $1,966 refund. (AE O, part v; Tr. 37, 57-58) \nApplicant has filed his TY 2022 federal income tax return. He said he owed \n$1,300 at the time of the hearing. After the hearing, he documented a tax payment of \n$1,700 in July 2023. (Tr. 51-54, 77-78; AE Q) \nAs to his current budget, Applicant pays $658 in monthly child support for his 13\u00ad\nyear-old daughter. It is taken out of his retirement pay. His child support requirement \ndecreased by half when his older daughter graduated. He receives about $2,100 a \nmonth in retirement pay, and about $4,177 in monthly VA disability compensation. He \nearns an estimated $118,000 annual salary. He keeps an informal family budget, and \nhe has a monthly surplus of about $3,500 to $4,000. He has a 401k pension plan and \ncontributes to it.

(AE E, AE J) His character references provided strong \nendorsements of his professionalism, judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, and eligibility \nfor a clearance. (AE I) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for TY 2012 after \nreturning from a difficult combat deployment, and also his state and federal income tax \nreturns for TY 2016 to 2019 after retiring from the Army. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(f) applies. Applicant \ndid not have to file a state income tax return for TY 2016. \nApplicant paid his TY 2020 federal tax debt of $8,300 by October 2021, about \nwhen he received the SOR). For the tax debt at SOR \u00b6 1.c, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) apply, \nbut he quickly resolved the debt. \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability.

Mar. 25, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nAug. 18, 2015). \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his TY 2012 federal income tax return was due to \nthe unusual circumstance of a combat deployment and its difficult aftermath. He did not \nrealize the return was unfiled for several years but addressed the matter responsibly \nwhen he learned of it. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies to that return. It also applies to any tax debt \nhe owed, since Applicant paid his outstanding taxes in good faith and has ample \nresources with which to address future obligations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant experienced decreased income and employment instability in 2017 \nafter he retired from the Army. He also was travelling out-of-state to the VA for medical \ntreatment. These circumstances contributed to his failure to file state and federal \nincome tax returns in his early years after the Army. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore has some \napplication. This impact was lessened, however, during subsequent years, when he \nwas earning increased income and his VA disability compensation was clarified, yet he \nfailed to address his tax filings more promptly. He therefore does not get full credit \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) or 20(d) for good-faith, responsible efforts under the circumstances. \nHowever, Applicant is credited with addressing his debts and tax issues by \nconsulting a reputable financial counselor beginning in May 2020 and following their \nadvice. He paid his debts and began to address his taxes with the assistance of a tax \npreparer that he continues to use. He filed several years of unfiled income tax returns, \nalbeit late, and paid what he owed. While the status of his taxes for TY 2021 is being \ndisputed, his debts and tax issues are being resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ntherefore applies, as does AG \u00b6 20(g). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my \nwhole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s financial hardships, his long, honorable, \nand decorated service in the Army, often in difficult circumstances, his excellent work \nrecord, and his efforts to resolve his tax issues. I also found his explanations and \ntestimony credible. After seeking appropriate professional financial and tax advice, he \npaid his debts and filed the late state and federal income tax returns at issue. While his \ntaxes for TY 2021 remain disputed, he continues to use professional services to \naddress his taxes. This lessens the likelihood of continued tax issues in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \neligibility for access to classified information.

He has worked for federal \ncontractors from April 2012 to October 2017. He was unemployed for one month before \nstarting work for his present employer in December 2017. His annual salary is \napproximately $47,000. (Tr. 13-19; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts totaling approximately $24,444. Applicant \ntestified that approximately six to seven years ago, his daughter had financial difficulties \nand was unable to pay her mortgage. Applicant paid her mortgage and stopped paying \nhis accounts, which then became delinquent. He said he tried to make some payments \non the accounts and thought he could catch up, but he got deeper in debt. His daughter \neventually sold her house. Applicant does not know if she made a profit. She has not \nreimbursed him. He said he was unaware his accounts were in a delinquent status until \nhe received the SOR. He admitted he should have been proactive in resolving them and \ndid not begin to address them until after he received the SOR. He testified that he was \nnot paying attention to his debts like he should have been. (Tr. 21-23, 51-54, 61) \nIn August 2020, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In \nresponse to questions about his finances, he disclosed he had one delinquent debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.g- $1,147). He said it would be paid by December 2020. He did not disclose any other \ndelinquent debts. He testified that he was unaware he had other delinquent debts until he \nreceived the SOR. (Tr. 54-55; GE 1) \nThe SOR debts are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer and \ntestimony, and credit reports from October 2020, May 2021, and August 2023. (GE 1, 2, \n3, 4) \nApplicant testified that prior to receiving the SOR, he began making online \npayments of $100 and $60 towards the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($3,790) and 1.b \n($3,546) owed to MD, the same collection creditor. These were credit card accounts. He \ntestified that he would provide proof of the payments he made and when they began. He \ndid not.

He \ntestified that all the debts in the SOR except the three owed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.k, for \n$431 to the same collection creditor, were the only debts not included in the agreement. \nApplicant began making monthly payments of $235 to DSC. After he made six \nconsecutive payments in January 2023, DSC offered to arrange a loan of approximately \n$10,000 through \u201cOL\u201d (apparently a loan company associated with DSC) and then use \nthat $10,000 to settle his outstanding debts. Applicant would then be required to make \nmonthly payments of $325 to repay OL. He said there is no interest rate on the loan but \nrather he pays a fee based on the amount of each debt that is resolved. (Tr. 19-20, 25-\n31, 34-51; GE 4) \nApplicant stated that he tried to include the MD debts in the plan, but MD would \nnot accept an agreement to settle their accounts through DSC. MD wanted to view \nApplicant\u2019s pay stubs for the past two years. MD refused to negotiate a settlement \nagreement with OL. Applicant stated that because the amount of the loan through OL was \nbased on all his delinquent debts, DSC repaid OL about $6,000 that it had anticipated \nusing to settle the accounts with MD. Applicant\u2019s loan from OL is listed on his most recent \ncredit report. It reflects a balance of $10,882 and consistent monthly payments of $325. \nIt is unclear if DSC made the reimbursement to OL, as the balance does not reflect a \nlesser amount. Applicant has not made any payments on the MD accounts since he \nbegan working with DSC. He further stated that since July 2023, DSC services have been \nterminated because his debts were paid. (Tr. 24-51; GE 4) \nApplicant testified that all the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, except those to \nMD, are paid. He said he has a meeting scheduled for November 2023 with MD to discuss \nsettlement of the three MD debts. The date of the meeting was scheduled by MD. He is \nnot currently making any payments to MD. When asked if he had money available to offer \na settlement to MD on the delinquent debts, he said he did not. (Tr. 24-27, 56-58) \nApplicant stated that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f., 1.g, 1.i, 1.l, \n1.m, 1.n and 1.p were all paid through DSC. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($756) is a medical \nbill that Applicant said was paid for by the VA after some confusion. He said he had the \nsupporting documentation and was going to provide it to show that it was resolved. He \ndid not. Applicant testified that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($702) is a cable bill. He \nobtained cable services for someone, and that person paid the debt. Applicant was to \nprovide proof of the payment but did not. Applicant\u2019s 2023 credit report shows that the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($2,049) and 1.o ($893) were resolved in January 2023 and \nNovember 2018, respectively. (Tr. 59-71; GE 4) \nApplicant was asked about a delinquent debt for $19,872 on his most recent credit \nreport. This debt is not alleged in the SOR. He explained that he obtained a loan to pay \na student loan in his mother\u2019s name that was obtained for him sometime in the early \n1980s. He obtained the loan in March 2022 and was to pay $525 a month. He arranged \nfor the amount to be automatically withdrawn from his account.

He made payments and his last was January 2023. He said \nhe contacted the creditor in June or July 2023 and tried to fix the problem. When asked if \nhe had saved the payments that were due so he could bring the account current, he said \nhe did not save the money and does not have it to pay the delinquent amount. He intends \nto fix the issue but has not yet done so. (Tr. 71- 79; GE 4) \nApplicant was asked about his current finances. He stated he did not have any \nmoney in his checking or savings account. He has about $30,000 in a retirement account. \nHe has about $1,200 to $1,600 of expendable income at the end of the month. \nOccasionally, he will help his daughters out financially if they request it. He spends some \nof his money on his grandchildren. Applicant takes full responsibility for not using good \njudgment in addressing his delinquent debts. He stated that he will make it right. He has \nnot participated in financial counseling. (Tr. 81-83) \nThe record was held open for Applicant to provide documents to substantiate that \nhe has resolved the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR and through DSC. He did not \nprovide any documents to show he resolved most of the debts. Many of the debts alleged \ndo not appear in Applicant\u2019s August 2023 credit report. It is unknown if they are not \nreported because they fell off due to the statute of limitations or have been resolved. \nApplicant does not have a plan in place for resolving the debts owed to MD. (GE 4) \nApplicant was asked if he had timely filed his tax returns for the past three years. \nHe stated he did not know because that is something his wife handles. He and his wife \nlive in different locations. He said they usually owe taxes. He was told to provide proof \nthat the taxes were timely filed. He did not. (Tr. 84-86) \nAny derogatory issues that were not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes but may be considered when making a credibility determination, \nin the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts for which he failed to take timely action \nthat remain unresolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApproximately six to seven years ago, Applicant made a decision to pay his \ndaughter\u2019s mortgage and not to pay his own debts. He was aware he had stopped making \npayments but said he was unaware of the severity of his financial problems until he \nreceived the SOR. He has numerous delinquent accounts that are in collection. After \nreceiving the SOR in May 2022, Applicant hired DCS to help him negotiate settlement \nagreements and resolve some of his delinquent accounts. He testified that most of his \ndelinquent debts are paid. He did not provide documentary proof to substantiate that he \nhas paid most of his delinquent debts. Three accounts owed to MD were not settled and \nApplicant has a meeting with them in November 2023 to make payment arrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and numerous. I cannot find they are unlikely to \nrecur. Even if his other debts are paid, he still has three totaling approximately $7,767 \nremaining to be paid. He will not begin to address these debts until November 2023 and \ntestified he does not currently have the resources to pay them. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were within his control when he chose to stop paying \nhis debts about six to seven years ago and used his money to pay his daughter\u2019s debts. \nHe failed to address his delinquent accounts until June 2022, after receiving the SOR. He \ndid not provide evidence that he has had financial counseling. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and \n20(c) do not apply. \nApplicant testified that he resolved the majority of his delinquent debts through \nDCS but failed to provide any documentary evidence to substantiate his statement. His \ncredit report shows two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.o) were paid. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to \nthese paid debts. Applicant has other delinquent debts that were not included with his \nDCS plan that are not resolved. He has not saved money to resolve these debts and does \nnot meet with the creditor until November 2023. Although it is not a requirement that all \nhis delinquent debts need to be satisfied before eligibility for a security clearance is \ngranted, I am not confident based on Applicant\u2019s past financial track record that future \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. I find AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those Guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service and VA disability. Applicant\u2019s failure to \naddress his delinquent debts until after he received the SOR, securing a new loan (over \n$19,000) to pay student loans and then defaulting on the loan, not having saved money \nto settle the remaining SOR debts, and failing to provide proof that he resolved his other \ndebts, does not reflect a stable financial track record. The record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph:  1.o: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.p:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s Response, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 66 years old and has been married since August 1982. He has an adult son and daughter and two adult stepdaughters. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in May 1982 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 1998. Since April 2016, he has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item 4.) The 1992 Offense Under AG D, the SOR alleged that in April 1992 Applicant was arrested and charged with Criminal Sexual Assault of a Family Member and Aggravated Criminal Sexual Assault of a victim less than 13 years of age. In his January 8, 2020 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), he explained that once he started the abuse he could not stop and needed to be arrested. (Item 5.) He pleaded guilty on October 26, 1992. (Item 7 at 3.) In his Answer, he admitted that he was arrested and charged, as alleged. He admitted that he was placed on four years of probation, He also admitted that he served four years of probation and never missed a meeting with his probation officer. He registered as a child sex offender for 10 years and attended mandatory professional counseling sessions for five years. (Item 3.)

The FORM was mailed \nto Applicant on May 31, 2022. He was afforded an opportunity to note objections and to \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation, and was given 30 days from \nreceipt of the FORM to do so. Applicant received the FORM on June 8, 2022. DOHA \nreceived his response on June 27, 2022 (Response). Applicant did not make any \nobjections to the Government\u2019s evidence. Department Counsel did not object to \nadmission of Applicant\u2019s June 27, 2022 FORM response (Response). Government Items \n1 and 2, the SOR and the Answer, respectively, are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 \nthrough 10 are admitted without objection, as is Applicant\u2019s Response. The case was \nassigned to me on September 6, 2022. \nFindings of Fact  \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s exhibits, \nand Applicant\u2019s Response, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 66 years old and has been married since August 1982. He has an \nadult son and daughter and two adult stepdaughters. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in \nMay 1982 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 1998. Since April 2016, he has been \nemployed by a defense contractor. (Item 4.) \nThe 1992 Offense \nUnder AG D, the SOR alleged that in April 1992 Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with Criminal Sexual Assault of a Family Member and Aggravated Criminal \nSexual Assault of a victim less than 13 years of age. In his January 8, 2020 Personal \nSubject Interview (PSI), he explained that once he started the abuse he could not stop \nand needed to be arrested. (Item 5.) He pleaded guilty on October 26, 1992. (Item 7 at \n3.) In his Answer, he admitted that he was arrested and charged, as alleged. He admitted \nthat he was placed on four years of probation, He also admitted that he served four years \nof probation and never missed a meeting with his probation officer. He registered as a \nchild sex offender for 10 years and attended mandatory professional counseling sessions \nfor five years. (Item 3.) On July 15, 1993, the court ordered that Applicant could return to \nhis marital home to reside with his family (his wife, his then minor son and daughter, and \nhis two then minor stepdaughters). (Item 7 at 19.) \nIn his PSI, Applicant explained his understanding of the end of his 10 years of child \nsex offender registration. Near the end of that 10 year period (2002 or 2003), he filed his \nperiodic registration form. The officer who processed the form told him that he no longer \nneeded to register and was no longer subject to monitoring, as a result of his 1992 \nconviction.

The first was in 2006 when his son, who is \ndisabled, graduated from high school. Applicant attended that graduation with his wife \nand family members. He knew at the time that he should have gotten permission from the \ncourt. (Item 5.) The second was an instance (date not stated) when one of his daughters \ntelephoned and asked if he and his wife could pick up her two sons (his grandsons) from \nschool. They did so. It is not clear on this record that this latter instance violated the terms \nof his sentence. He volunteered those instances to the OPM investigator to be \u201copen and \nhonest.\u201d (Response.) \nThe 2019 Offense \nUnder AG D, the SOR alleged that in March 2019 Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with a misdemeanor of being as Child Sex Offender Unlawfully Present in a \nPublic Park. On May 23, 2019, Applicant pleaded guilty to that charge and was placed on \n12 months court supervision until May 22, 2020. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted that he was \narrested and charged, as alleged. (Item 3.) Applicant was found guilty and sentenced to \none year of court supervision and fined for fees and costs totaling $1,247. His sentence \nwas satisfied on September 16, 2020. (Item 9.) \nApplicant did not know it was illegal for him to enter a public park for a walk with \nan adult companion. He had not yet exited his car when arrested. He did not knowingly \nor willfully violate the law. (Item 3.) Applicant pleaded guilty on advice of counsel. He \nquestioned, however, whether the law applied to him, because it was passed in 2012, \nyears after his 1992 offense. There were no children in the park at the time of his arrest, \nwhich is required by the current law. The Arrest Report did not note that children were \npresent then. (Items 3, 5, 8, and 10.) Nonetheless, he pleaded guilty because at the time \nhe \u201cwas in the process of a Federal Background Investigation [for a security clearance] \nand did not want that to get affected.\u201d (Item 5.) \nIn his PSI, Applicant explained his understanding of the end of his 10 years of child \nsex offender registration. Near the end of that 10 year period (2002 or 2003), he filed his \nperiodic registration form. The officer who processed the form told him that he no longer \nneeded to register and was no longer subject to monitoring, as a result of his 1992 \nconviction.

Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and denials to AG D are incorporated herein by reference. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis  \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual conduct: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe 1992 Offense \nApplicant was arrested in April 1992 and charged with criminal sexual assault of \nminor family members. He pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to: (1) four years of \nprobation; (2) registration as a sex offender for 10 years; (3) attend mandatory counselling \nfor five years. There was also evidence that he suffered some form of compulsion to do \nthese acts. This conduct triggers AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), (b), (c), and (d). \nThe next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 14 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions for sexual \nconduct: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment.  \nApplicant\u2019s 1992 conviction occurred 30 years ago. His sentence included four \nyears of probation, which he completed. He registered as a sex offender for 10 years, \nwhich he also completed. He attended five years of mandatory professional counseling, \nwhich he also successfully completed. In 1993, not long into Applicant\u2019s sentence, the \ncourt allowed Applicant to return to his marital home to reside with his family (his wife, his \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthen minor son and daughter, and his two then minor stepdaughters). I conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s 1992 offense has been mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b), (c), and (e). \n The 2019 Incident \nThe facts of this aspect of the case do not trigger disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n13(b) through (d). The only potentially disqualifying condition, therefore, is AG \u00b6 13(a), \n\u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature.\u201d Applicant\u2019s mere presence in a forest preserve as \na former child sex offender was a misdemeanor. His presence, however, was not \u201csexual \nbehavior.\u201d His only sexual behavior did not happen in 2019; it happened in 1992. The \ncircumstances of his 1992 crime, his sentence, and his successful completion of that \nsentence were fully discussed above. No Guideline D disqualifying conditions apply to \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Therefore, there is no need to discuss Guideline D mitigating conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Only the following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nApplicant\u2019s April 1992 and March 2019 convictions satisfy AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b). \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity\ninvolvement. \n Guideline J: Criminal Conduct: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe foregoing discussion of the applicable mitigating conditions under AG D is \nequally applicable and is incorporated herein by reference. I conclude that the 1992 and \n2019 offenses have been mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline D, sexual behavior, and \nGuideline J, criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old married man with four adult children, two of whom are from a previous marriage. He is a veteran, serving in the inactive Army reserve from 1982 until 2002, when he retired honorably. (GE 5 at 20) Applicant\u2019s wife is also a military veteran. (Item 6 at 17) After retirement, Applicant completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. (Item 5 at 13) He was married from 2006 to 2018. Since retiring from the Army, Applicant has worked for a federal contractor as a logistics analyst. Between 2006 and 2017, he worked overseas, supporting the U.S. military in several combat zones. (Item 4 at 14-15) While overseas, he typically worked 12 hours per day for seven days per week. (Item 4 at 14-15) In 2006, Applicant and his wife relocated to another state and purchased their first home. After the move, his wife was unable to find another job. Consequently, the family income decreased by $50,000. (Item 6 at 7) The move also created unanticipated challenges for their two children. Specifically, both are autistic and struggled to adjust to the change. (Item 6 at 7) The problems with their children compelled Applicant\u2019s wife to stay home and support them.

He requested a decision \nbased on the documentary record, instead of a hearing. \nOn May 27, 2022, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM), containing 12 attachments (Items 1 \u2013 12) in support of the SOR allegations. \nApplicant received a copy of the FORM on June 15, 2022, and was given until July 15, \n2022 to file a reply. Applicant did not submit a response. On August 3, 2022, the case \nwas assigned to me. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 59-year-old married man with four adult children, two of whom are \nfrom a previous marriage. He is a veteran, serving in the inactive Army reserve from 1982 \nuntil 2002, when he retired honorably. (GE 5 at 20) Applicant\u2019s wife is also a military \nveteran. (Item 6 at 17) After retirement, Applicant completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. \n(Item 5 at 13) He was married from 2006 to 2018. \nSince retiring from the Army, Applicant has worked for a federal contractor as a \nlogistics analyst. Between 2006 and 2017, he worked overseas, supporting the U.S. \nmilitary in several combat zones. (Item 4 at 14-15) While overseas, he typically worked \n12 hours per day for seven days per week. (Item 4 at 14-15) \nIn 2006, Applicant and his wife relocated to another state and purchased their first \nhome. After the move, his wife was unable to find another job. Consequently, the family \nincome decreased by $50,000. (Item 6 at 7) The move also created unanticipated \nchallenges for their two children. Specifically, both are autistic and struggled to adjust to \nthe change. (Item 6 at 7) The problems with their children compelled Applicant\u2019s wife to \nstay home and support them. (Item 6 at 9) Consequently, the loss of her income and the \nstress it created on the family evolved from a temporary problem to a persistent one. (Item \n6 at 7) \nBy the time Applicant returned home between overseas assignments in May 2008, \nhis delinquent bills had increased to the point where he could not afford to satisfy them. \nConsequently, he consulted an attorney who helped him file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nprotection, as alleged in subparagraph 1.b. (Item 6 at 7; Item 10) Approximately $81,000 \nwas included in the payment plan. (Item 6 at 7-8) By November 2013, Applicant had \nsuccessfully completed the court-mandated payment plan, and the following month, the \ncase was discharged. (Item 10 at 5) \nWhen working overseas, Applicant earned approximately $140,000 annually. (Item \n6 at 16) In 2017, he did not pass a physical that his job required to enable its employees \nto work overseas. (Item 6 at 16) His employer did not fire him; however, they transferred \nhim to a position at a U.S. location. This transfer resulted in an $80,000 annual pay cut \nfor Applicant.

(Item 6 at 16) Applicant applied but was not accepted into \nthe program. \nIn early 2019, the mortgage company moved to foreclose. In response, Applicant \ncontacted a bankruptcy attorney. The attorney advised him to file a motion for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection. Applicant did as advised and filed the petition in February 2019. It \nincluded the debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 9 at 25-26) As part of the requirements to \nfile the petition, Applicant completed credit counseling. (Item 9 at 11) \nPer the bankruptcy plan, Applicant was supposed to pay $3,500 monthly. (Item 9 \nat 16) Initially, Applicant made the payments, as ordered. Then, his wife, who by then was \nreceiving disability payments through the Department of Veterans Affairs, experienced a \ndisability rating change, followed by a decrease in monthly pay. Then, one of his children \nreceived a reduction in Supplemental Security Income benefits. Consequently, Applicant \nwas unable to make the monthly payments through the bankruptcy plan, and the court \ndismissed the petition.  (Item 1 at 16) \nAs for the unsecured debts that were included in the bankruptcy, Applicant is \naware that the creditors could reach out to him to obtain payments since the petition has \nbeen dismissed, but he suspects that these debts had all been charged off his credit \nreport. (Item 16 at 20) As of March 2021, these debts remained outstanding. ((Item 3 at \n2-3) \nAs for the mortgage, Applicant has not made a mortgage payment since 2017. \n(Item 6 at 17) Applicant sought a refinance after the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition. \nThe mortgage company denied his request. (Item 6 at 17) However, the mortgage \ncompany, in late July 2019, allowed Applicant to participate in a financial hardship \nforbearance plan. (Item 6 at 17) During the forbearance period, Applicant did not have to \nmake any payments. \nThe mortgage has been out of forbearance since August 2021. (Item 6 at 17) The \ncurrent mortgage delinquency totals $97,977. (Item 3 at 3) Since the forbearance expired, \nthe mortgage company refuses to accept partial payments towards satisfaction of the \ndelinquency. Although the home\u2019s value is worth approximately $38,000 more than he \nowes, Applicant has no plans to sell the home, or otherwise resolve the mortgage. (Item \n6 at 18) \nApplicant maintains a budget. He has $10,000 deposited in a savings account, \napproximately $3,100 invested in a retirement account, and he has $2,127 in after-\nexpense monthly income. (Item 9 at 18) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in April 2018. He did not \ndisclose any delinquent debs, as required, in response to Section 26 of the application. \n(Item 5 at 35-36) During an interview a few months later, in October 2018, Applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisclosed his delinquent debt to the investigative agent after being confronted about it, \nand attributed his failure to include his delinquent debt on the application to unintentional \noversight. (Item 6 at 12-13) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in November 2020. He \ndisclosed all pertinent financial information about his financial problems, as required in \nresponse to Section 26, and stated in response to a request to provide steps that he was \ntaking to resolve his financial problems, that he was \u201cworking on the situation.\u201d (Item 4 at \n36) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts during a 2009 interview with \nan authorized DOD investigator when he denied having any derogatory financial \ninformation or accounts. Per the agent\u2019s summary of the interview, Applicant \u201cwas \nconfronted with derogatory financial information as directed under special interview [and] \nhe provided the following explanation.\u201d (Item 6 at 7) Applicant proceeded to discuss his \nfinancial difficulties in depth, identifying multiple debts that were included in a bankruptcy \nthat he had filed. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to report to his company\u2019s facility security \nofficer that he was experiencing financial hardship. In support thereof, the Government \nsubmitted a continuous evaluation report, dated April 2020, disclosing several delinquent \ndebts and noting that Applicant did not self-report them. (Item 12) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of recurrent financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source . . . and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant first experienced financial problems after struggles with his two autistic \nchildren compelled his wife to quit her job to care for them. His financial problems recurred \napproximately ten years later after he failed a physical, prompting a transfer to a job within \nthe company that paid $80,000 less than the job that required him to pass a physical. \nApplicant has provided no evidence of any steps that he is currently taking to \nresolve his financial problems. His most recent Chapter 13 petition was dismissed for \nfailure to comply with the plan, and he has not made a mortgage payment on his home \nsince 2017. Consequently, the issues with his children, and the major pay cuts he has \ntaken over the years trigger the partial application of AG \u00b6 20(b), but the failure to provide \nany evidence of rehabilitation of his financial problems, render the remainder of AG \u00b6 \n20(b), as well as any of the other mitigating conditions, inapplicable. I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) \nThe Government contends that Applicant falsified his April 2018 security clearance \napplication by omitting relevant information about his delinquent finances, and that he lied \nto an investigative agent when asked about the omissions in a follow-up interview in \nOctober 2018. These allegations raise the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. \nProof of an omission alone does not establish a deliberate falsification. In order to\nestablish falsification, the Government must establish that the omission was deliberate. \n(ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)). Here, Applicant\u2019s unintentional \nomission was, at worst, careless. As such, I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is inapplicable to \nApplicant\u2019s omissions on his 2018 security clearance application. I resolve subparagraph \n2.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nAs for Applicant\u2019s follow-up interview with an investigative agent in October 2018, \nthere is nothing in the investigator\u2019s summary that indicates that he believed Applicant \nfalsified material facts. Consequently, AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or \nmisleading information; or concealing or omitting information concerning relevant facts to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan employer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national security \neligibility determination, or other official government representative,\u201d does not apply. I \nresolve subparagraph 2.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSimilarly, during the interview 13 years ago in 2009, as referenced in subparagraph \n2.c, the investigative agent does not raise the issue of falsification in the summary \nstatement. Consequently, I conclude that Applicant did not falsify financial information to \nan agent during a 2009 interview, and that AG \u00b6 16(b) is inapplicable. I resolve \nsubparagraph 2.c in his favor. \nThe fact that debts appeared on a 2020 continuous evaluation report before \nApplicant reported them to his employer does not establish that he intentionally withheld \nthis information from his employer, as alleged in subparagraph 2.d, particularly given that \nhe discussed the same debts during an investigative interview two years earlier. I \nconclude that allegation set forth in subparagraph 2.d does not trigger any security \nconcern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant deserves credit for his military service and for the 12 years he spent \nworking in various combat zones as a federal contractor after retiring from the military. \nHowever, absent evidence that substantiates that Applicant is satisfying, or otherwise \nresolving his financial delinquencies, any positive inference about his character that can \nbe gleaned from his service to the government are insufficient to carry the burden. Upon \nconsidering this case in the context of the whole-person concept, I conclude Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, and 2.a.~c. He denied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and 1.g. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He retired from the U.S. Air Force in June of 2010 and has been employed with the defense contractor since June of 2010. He has held a security clearance since about 1987. He is divorced and has one adult child. (TR at page 31 line 14 to page 44 line 7, and GX 1 at pages 7, 13, 18, 25 and 36~37.) He attributes his financial difficulties to a failed side-business, involving firearms, and to his divorce. Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of about $6,530 \u201cfor computers.\u201d Since April of 2022, Applicant has been making monthly payments of $320 towards this admitted debt, as corroborated by documentation from Creditor A. (TR at page 44 line 18 to page 48 line 8, and AppX E.) This allegation is found for Applicant. 1.b. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of about $1,001. He avers that this debt has been \u201cpaid in full,\u201d as is corroborated by a document from the successor creditor to this debt. (TR at page 48 line 9 to page 50 line 6, and AppX F.)

Marrone, Esq., Applicant\u2019s Counsel \n \n \nMarch 29, 2023 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 1, 2021, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines F and I. The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 8, 2022, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on July 18, 2022. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August \n8, 2022, scheduling the hearing for October 13, 2022. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 7, which were admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and called two witness, one of whom \nwas his treating physician. Applicant offered numerous documents, which I marked \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through LL and admitted into evidence. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (TR) on October 25, 2022. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, and 2.a.~c. \nHe denied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and 1.g. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He retired from the \nU.S. Air Force in June of 2010 and has been employed with the defense contractor \nsince June of 2010. He has held a security clearance since about 1987. He is divorced \nand has one adult child. (TR at page 31 line 14 to page 44 line 7, and GX 1 at pages 7, \n13, 18, 25 and 36~37.)  He attributes his financial difficulties to a failed side-business, \ninvolving firearms, and to his divorce. \n \n \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of \nabout $6,530 \u201cfor computers.\u201d Since April of 2022, Applicant has been making monthly \npayments of $320 towards this admitted debt, as corroborated by documentation from \nCreditor A. (TR at page 44 line 18 to page 48 line 8, and AppX E.)  This allegation is \nfound for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of about \n$1,001. He avers that this debt has been \u201cpaid in full,\u201d as is corroborated by a document \nfrom the successor creditor to this debt. (TR at page 48 line 9 to page 50 line 6, and \nAppX F.)  This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.c, 1.d and 1.f. Applicant admits that he has past-due debts to Creditor C in the \namounts of about $9,276; $9,349; and $36,928. These debts are related to his failed \nbusiness; and have been either \u201csuccessfully settled\u201d or \u201cpaid in full,\u201d as corroborated by \ndocumentation from Creditor C. (TR at page 50 line 7 to page 54 line 25, at page 55 line \n24 to page 58 line 20, and AppXs G, H, KK and LL.)  These allegations are found for \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.e. Applicant denies another past-due debt to Creditor C in the amount of about \n$3,177. He avers that this debt has been \u201cpaid in full,\u201d as is corroborated by a document \nfrom the successor creditor to this debt. (TR at page 55 lines 1~23, and AppX I.)  This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.g. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor G in the amount of about $689. \nHe avers that he is \u201cin Good standing with no Past-due balance,\u201d as evidenced by a \ndocument from Creditor G. (TR at page 48 line 9 to page 50 line 6, and AppX F.)  This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.h. Applicant admits that he was indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), \nfor back-business taxes, in the amount of $2,567. It has been paid, as evidenced by \ndocumentation from the IRS. (TR at page 59 line 6 to page 60 line 18, and AppX K.) \nThis allegation is found for Applicant. \n  \nGuideline I - Psychological Conditions \n \n \n2.c. (These allegations are discussed chronologically) Applicant admits that since \nat least August of 2016, he has been treated for depression. He was treated by \u201cseveral \ndoctors and several different medicines.\u201d These medications would work for a while, but \nthen Applicant would begin feeling like \u201ca zombie.\u201d As a result, Applicant would go off \nthe medications for periods of \u201ca couple of months,\u201d as recently as February 2020. (TR \nat page 86 line 22 to page 83 line 6, and at page 97 line 7 to page 99 line 5.) \n \n \n2.b. Applicant admits that in November of 2020, he was involuntarily hospitalized \nfor suicidal ideation. However, not to exacerbate his situation; Applicant intentionally \nloaded his firearm, backwards, so that it could not be discharged. He also spoke to his \ntreating physician prior to his hospitalization. (Tr at page 71 line 23 to page 77 line 7, \nand at page 90 line 1 to page 96 line 1.) \n \n \n2.a. Applicant admits that in July of 2021, he was involuntarily hospitalized for \ntwelve days as the result of suicidal ideations. (GX 7.)  Prior to this hospitalization, in \ndiscussions with his treating physician, Applicant \u201crealized . . . that he \u201cwas just \nchemically off balance.\u201d After his discharge, and with a change in medication, Applicant \nhas \u201cbeen 100 percent better since then.\u201d (TR at page 64 line 11 to page 71 line 19, and \nat page 103 line 17 to page 112 line 25.)  His treating physician testified that Applicant\u2019s \nchange in \u201cthe medication [was] definitely a turning point.\u201d She avers that \u201chis prognosis \nis great . . . as long as he takes his medication. It\u2019s a chemical thing.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \ntreating physician has no cause \u201cfor concern regarding . . . [Applicant\u2019s] judgment, . . . \ntrustworthiness or . . . reliability.\u201d (TR at page 115 line 21 to page 134 line 5.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant had substantial past-due indebtedness, mostly attributed to a failed \nbusiness. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant addressed all of the alleged past-due indebtedness. They are the result \nof a failed business and a failed marriage. He has demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. \n \nGuideline I - Psychological Conditions   \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nforth at AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \n\n \n6 \n \nmental health professional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability or trustworthiness, not covered under and that may indicate \nan emotional, mental or personality condition, including, but not limited \nto, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;                                      \n                                                                                                                                        \n(b) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and                                                              \n \n(c) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including but not limited to failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling \nsessions. \n                                                                                                                                                       \n \nAppellant has had two involuntary hospitalizations: in November of 2020, and in \nJuly 2021. Therefore, AG \u00b6 28 is established.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Four conditions may be applicable: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with \nthe treatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the \nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified metal health professional; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nMore than a year prior to his hearing; Applicant changed his medication, and no \nlonger has a chemical imbalance in his brain. His treating physician avers that, with this \nchange in medication, Applicant is now trustworthy. Therefore, AG \u00b6 29 is established \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and I in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \na distinguished history of in serving in the U.S. Air Force, and working in the defense \nindustry, and is respected by those who know him (TR at page 21 line 4 to page 30 line \n7). He performs well at his military and civilian jobs.  (AppXs O. P, and V~JJ.) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations and Psychological Conditions \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline I:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (undated), and requested a hearing. This case \nwas assigned to me on July 18, 2022. A hearing was scheduled for September 19, \n2022, via Teams Teleconference Services, and was heard on the scheduled date. At \nthe hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of five exhibits. (GEs 1-5) Applicant \nrelied on one witness (himself) and eight exhibits (A-H). The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on September 28, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of his \nresolution of his SOR-listed creditors. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 30 \ncalendar days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded seven days \nto respond. (Tr. 65-66) \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a documented\npayoff of one of the listed SOR creditors (SOR \u00b6 1.j) and payment agreements with five\nof his SOR creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f and 1.h-1.i) He reported unsuccessful attempts to obtain\npayment agreements with two of his SOR creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 a-1.b). And, he reported\nongoing negotiations with his two remaining creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g).  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were admitted without objection as AEs G-\nL. These post-hearing submissions were considered along with Applicant\u2019s admitted\nhearing exhibits in rendering a final decision on December 23, 2022. \n \n Remand from Appeal Board. \nOn March 14, 2023, the Appeal Board remanded the case to consider post-\nhearing submissions covering the following: six receipts associated with payment \nagreements with SOR creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, through 1.i and a documented monthly budget. \nUpon receipt of the remand decision, I opened the record to permit Applicant to further \nsupplement the record to document updated payment receipts for the creditors \nidentified in the remand decision and provide a documented budget covering \nApplicant\u2019s monthly income, expenses, and remainder. Within the time permitted to \nsupplement the record (seven calendar days), Applicant documented his updated \nmonthly payments to SOR creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e-1.f, and 1.h-1.i. He also documented his \n$8,500 payoff of his SOR creditor \u00b6 1.g debt, as well as his budget covering his monthly \nincome ($6,500), expenses (($4,749), and remainder ($1,751). Applicant\u2019s post-remand \nexhibits were admitted without objection as AEs M-S. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated 10 delinquent \nmedical and consumer debts exceeding $44,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been \nresolved. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the alleged SOR debts \nwith explanations. He claimed to be working with the collection agencies of the covered \nSOR creditors to review his payment options. Applicant denied the allegations covered \nby SOR \u00b6 1.j, claiming he worked with a collection agency for this creditor and paid off \nthe debt in August 2021. \nAddressing the SOR allegations generally, Applicant claimed he lives within his \nmeans and has maintained consistent excellent employment for the past 12 years. Also, \nhe claimed to have lived frugally in the same apartment for the past 12 years since he \nstarted his job, and has maintained employment in the same job role at the company \nwith consistent reports of excellent job performance without any reported incidents of \nwrongdoing. Further, he claimed a consistent history of trustworthy and positive \ncontributions on and off the job. And, he claimed he has never done anything to \ncompromise his career or the confidential data he has been assigned to protect. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant never married and has one child from a prior relationship for whom he \nis obligated to pay currently enforced weekly child support through garnished \ndeductions of his paychecks. (GE 1; Tr. 16) He earned a high school diploma in May \n2003 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2010. (GE 1) He reported no military service. \nSince October 2010, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nsystem design engineer. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 33) He has held a security clearance since 2011. \n(GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween November 2018 and December 2019, Applicant accumulated \ndelinquent medical and consumer accounts exceeding $44,000. (GEs 2-5) Included \nSOR debts are as follows: 1.a (a medical debt for $163); 1.b (a medical debt for $488); \n1.c (a utility debt for $272); 1.d (a consumer debt for $2,947); 1.e (a consumer debt for \n$6,428); 1.f (a consumer debt for $950); 1.g (a consumer debt for $15,184); 1.h (a \nconsumer debt for $4,625); 1.i (a consumer debt for $8,579); and 1.j (a consumer debt \nfor $5,647). (GEs 2-5; Tr. 42-44) These debts are listed in Applicant\u2019s credit reports as \nunresolved and outstanding. (GEs 2-5) Once he was able to verify these reported debts, \nApplicant confirmed the following: (a) the SOR \u00b6 1.j debt was previously satisfied; (b) he \nhad either worked out settlement agreements with the creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f and \n1.h-1.i); he was still working with the creditors. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g); and (c) he was \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nunable to resolve his two remaining delinquent accounts with the information available \nto him (as with SOR creditors 1.a-1.b). (AEs B-L) \nApplicant attributed his debt delinquencies to a poor start out of college before he \neven received his first paycheck from his first employer in 2010. (Tr. 31) While flying\nhome from college, he was stopped at a local airport and cited for having a loaded, \nalbeit legal, handgun inside his checked luggage bag. (Tr. 28) The airport citation cost\nhim $8,000, in addition to added attorneys fees. Additional unexpected expenses\nincluded weekly court-ordered (in August 2022) payroll garnishments of $650 to cover\nhis child support arrearage and payments to his student loan lenders. (AE A; Tr. 36, 39-\n40) \n \n \n \n \n \nWith a recent promotion and salary increase, expected reduction in his student \nloans due to the student loan forgiveness program, and his son\u2019s reaching the age of \nmajority (freeing him from child support obligations), Applicant stressed his \u201cnew \nroadmap to how he can pay\u201d his unresolved SOR debts. (AE E; Tr. 31, 58) His post-\nhearing submissions credited him with resolving his SOR \u00b6 1.j debt with a prior payoff \n($5,647) and payment agreements with SOR creditors 1.d (agreed monthly payments of \n$50 beginning in October 2022); 1.e (agreed monthly payments of $150, beginning in \nSeptember 2022); 1.f (agreed monthly payments of $60, beginning in October 2022); \n1.h (agreed monthly payments of $55.49, beginning in October 2022); and 1.i (agreed \nmonthly payments of $142, beginning in September 2022). (AEs C and H-L)  \nBefore the issuance of the initial decision in this case, Applicant documented his \npayoff of his SOR \u00b6 1.j debt and payment agreements with five of his SOR creditors \n(SOR creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.f and 1.h-1.i) His agreements were accompanied by scheduled \nfirst payments in compliance with the terms of the respective agreements. (AEs D-L) \nEach of his payment agreements were concluded after the hearing and involved agreed \nscheduled monthly payments to be honored by Applicant in the future and were \naccompanied by scheduled first due payments. \nStill unresolved prior to the remand of this case were his listed debts with SOR \ncreditors 1.a-1.c and 1.g. With these three creditors, Applicant had been unsuccessful in \nresolving his debt delinquencies before the completion of the initial hearing and post-\nhearing proceedings. (Tr. 59-60) \nSince the remand, Applicant has continued to make his monthly payment in \ncompliance with the payment schedule established for each of the debt delinquencies \ncovered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f and 1.h-1.i. (AEs N-R) Applicant also documented his payoff \nof the debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.g with an $8,500 payment. (AE M) Altogether, Applicant \naddressed all but three of the listed SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). (AE E) These three \nunresolved debts total less than $1,000 and do not materially detract from his overall \ngood-faith efforts in resolving his delinquent accounts. \nIn his hearing, Applicant represented that he currently earns around $100,000, \nand nets around $5,000 a month. (Tr. 35-36) After allowing for monthly expenses, he \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestimated a net monthly remainder of around $1,000.

(Tr. 62-63) Applicant reported no savings account, but did claim a \n401(k) retirement account with about $120,000 in the account. (Tr. 38) \n Policies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \n    The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of 10 \ndelinquent accounts. These debt delinquencies warrant the application of two of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial considerations guideline: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nEach of these DCs are pertinent to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s 10 admitted debts with explanations and clarifications require no \nindependent proof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick \non Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although he qualified his admissions with \nexplanations, his admissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed \nduring the hearing.  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in\nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified\ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App.\nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cited child support garnishments, airport fines, student debt \nobligations, and other limitations on his ability to address his SOR debts played some \nrole in his accrual of so many delinquent debts over the past few years. Recognizing \nthese added financial burdens on his keeping up with his debts, mitigating condition MC \n\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \nemergency a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending \npractices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances,\u201d partially applies to applicant\u2019s situation. \nTwo major consumer debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.j) associated with Applicant\u2019s \nSOR accounts have since been satisfied and resolved by Applicant with credited \npayoffs. For these paid off accounts, application of 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is \nadhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d is \napplicable to Applicant\u2019s financial situation. \nIn addressing his remaining debt delinquencies, Applicant has made \nconsiderable progress. Afforded hearing, post-hearing, and post-remand opportunities \nto address his still unresolved accounts, Applicant documented (a) five settlement \nagreements with SOR creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f and 1.h-1.i, along with accompanying initial \nmonthly payments. In his post-remand submissions, he documented continuing monthly \npayments in compliance with his settlement agreements with SOR creditors 1.d-1.f and \n1.h-1.i), along with a payoff of his SOR \u00b6 1.g debt. With these additionally credited \ncompliance payments with these creditors, along with his credited payoff of his SOR \ncreditor 1.g debt, Applicant is entitled to favorable resolution of these SOR accounts. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track record \nof actual debt reduction to satisfy Appeal Board guidance.  \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions, his \nexplanations of the debts attributed to him in the SOR, and his substantial repayment \ninitiatives, enough evidence has been presented to facilitate safe predictions of his \nability to maintain responsible sufficient control of his finances to meet minimum \nstandards for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

She married in \n2015 and separated in January 2019.

(Answer; Tr. 2 at 5, 7-9, 25-31, 62-67, 69-73, \n86-87; GE 1-2) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2018, and \nher bankruptcy case was dismissed in December 2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) It also alleged that \nshe had four delinquent consumer debts totaling $14,069 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.i, 1.l), and \nnine delinquent medical debts totaling $4,375  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d, 1.f-1.h, 1.j-1.k, 1.m-1.n) \nThe SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer, her \nDecember 2020 security clearance application (SCA), her January 2021 interview with a \nbackground investigator, two credit bureau reports from 2020 and 2021, and a bankruptcy \ncourt record. (Answer; GE 1-5) \nApplicant attributed her financial difficulties to her financial illiteracy; her periods of \nunderemployment and unemployment; being the sole provider for her children after she \nseparated from her spouse; her health issues; and her lack of health insurance. The first \ntime she had health insurance was during a three-month probationary period through her \nemployer between 2017 and 2018. She unsuccessfully attempted to work with her \ncreditors, and then she made a hasty decision to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy to try to resolve \nher debts. She withdrew her petition after her mother advised her that proceeding with \nbankruptcy could negatively affect her ability to purchase a home in the future. She sought \nhelp from Credit Karma in 2019, but she elected to apply the money she would have paid \nfor their services to her debts. Her income increased and she obtained health insurance \nthrough her current employer, and she was working to resolve her financial issues.

(GE 1; Tr. 2 at 29-31, \n34, 62-88, 93-96, 99; AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and, \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay her debts. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide \nevidence that she acted responsibly under her circumstances. Before she received the \nSOR, she unsuccessfully attempted to work with her creditors.

Since she began working for her current employer in 2018, her \nwages have been garnished to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.e. She sought help from Credit Karma in \n2019 and chose instead to apply the money she would have paid for their services to her \ndebts. \nIn 2022, Applicant settled SOR \u00b6 1.b and then made monthly payments of $100 \nthat decreased her balance to $757 as of January 2023. She also paid a number of her \nmedical debts. A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case \nNo. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that \nan individual make payment on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). She \ndoes not have any other delinquent debts. She has demonstrated a good-faith effort to \naddress her debts, and the money she has utilized to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.b will provide her \nwith the means to continue to resolve her remaining debts. I find that Applicant\u2019s finances \ndo not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), and 20(d) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n: \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Tr. 23, 28-\n32, 35-38; GE 1, 6) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s 15 delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $56,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.o). These delinquencies consisted of \ninsurance accounts, vehicle loans, utility accounts, and personal loans, among others. \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with additional comment, with the \nexception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.h, and 1.n, which he denied with additional comment. He \nneither admitted nor denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.n, so I have treated his lack of \nresponse as a denial. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact and are \ncorroborated by the Government\u2019s 2022, 2021, and 2018 credit reports. (SOR; Answer; \nGE 2-6) \nThe 2022 and 2021 credit reports listed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g as paid prior to the \nissuance of the SOR. This account is resolved in favor of Applicant. (Answer, GE 2, 3, \n6) \nApplicant denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c because he thought his insurance \nshould cover it. He claimed that he contacted the creditor of the debt in 2017 to file an \ninsurance claim that he thought would satisfy it. He claimed that the creditor told him he \ndid not have the necessary insurance, so he stopped trying to address this debt. He \nprovided no documentation corroborating these efforts, or corroborating that insurance \nshould have satisfied the debt. The debt is listed as delinquent in the 2022 and 2021 \ncredit reports. (Tr. 54-56; Answer; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant claimed that the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h are duplicate \naccounts because he only had one account with this creditor. He also claimed that he \nbelieved that he paid the account in SOR \u00b6 f. He provided no documentary evidence to \ncorroborate these claims. Instead, the 2018 credit report listed two delinquent accounts \nwith different account numbers, different balances, and different dates on which the \naccounts were opened. The debts are listed as delinquent on the 2018 credit report with \na last action date of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Both accounts were placed for \ncollection more than six years ago, so it is possible that they aged off subsequent credit \nreports. Based upon the foregoing, I conclude that Applicant had two separate \ndelinquent accounts with this creditor and they are unresolved. (Answer; GE 4-6) \nThe delinquent personal loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n is listed in the 2018 credit \nreport as having been placed for collection. It has a last activity date of May 2013.

Applicant did not provide documentary evidence to \nsupport the account is resolved. (Answer; GE 4-6) \nApplicant claimed that he would resolve his SOR debts by filing a petition in \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. He has yet to file, but he claimed the he has retained a \nbankruptcy attorney, filled out the necessary paperwork and paid the fees to do so. He \nclaimed that he would have approximately $40,000 discharged through his bankruptcy \nwhen the process is completed. He is waiting to file bankruptcy to avoid having it on his \ncredit report while trying to locate a new residence. He also said, without providing a \nspecified reason, that he has been waiting until his security-clearance adjudication is \ncompleted to file bankruptcy. He acknowledged that he decided to file bankruptcy in \nJanuary 2022, because he realized his security clearance was in jeopardy because of \nhis delinquent debts. He took the credit counseling class that is a prerequisite for filing a \nbankruptcy petition. (Tr. 51-53, 57-58); Answer; GE 6) \nApplicant claimed that he contacted the creditor of the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.o in 2014 or 2015 to make payment arrangements, but he could not reach an \nagreement because the creditor wanted him to pay more money than he could afford. \nThese debts are unresolved. (Tr. 54-56) \nApplicant made no other efforts to contact the creditors or dispute any of the \nremaining SOR debts. With the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.g, he made no payments on the \nSOR debts after they became delinquent. Other than SOR \u00b6 1.g, the SOR debts are \nestablished and unresolved. (Answer, Tr. 54-56; GE 2-6) \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to several causes. He had a three-week \nfurlough in 2013, when he earned no income. He claimed that not only did this furlough \nhave a cascading effect that detracted from his ability to pay his debts, it directly led to\nhis having to move in with his father and to falling behind on the debt listed in SOR \u00b6\n1.d. His cohabitant, who contributes to the household finances, has not earned as much \nmoney as he has and, at times, has been unemployed. His cohabitant\u2019s 63-year-old\nmother resides with them while only providing money for the water and gas bill. He has\nhad to take out short-term payday loans in order to meet his monthly expenses, and\nthen was unable to pay some of these payday loans pursuant to their terms.

(Tr. 40-50) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was paid prior to the issuance of the SOR. I find in \nApplicant\u2019s favor with respect to that allegation. Otherwise, Applicant had 14 delinquent \ndebts totaling about $56,000 that have been delinquent for years. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nprovide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. The \nevidence does not show that the debts are resolved or are under control. I cannot find \nthey are unlikely to recur. He has not established a track record of financial \nresponsibility. If he does file bankruptcy, his debts are eventually discharged, and he \nstays current on his debts afterwards, he may be able to meet this mitigating condition. \nHowever, he currently fails to meet that standard. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of a furlough, his cohabitant\u2019s \nunemployment and underemployment, and his willingness to financially support \nmembers of his cohabitant\u2019s family. These conditions were beyond his control. \nHowever, his financial issues also arose because of his negligence and mishandling \nmoney. These conditions were within his control. To the extent conditions were beyond \nhis control, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, he must also show that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances with respect to these debts. While he claimed that he would file \nChapter 7 bankruptcy to resolve these debts, he has yet to do so after almost a year. \nMoreover, while filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a legally permissible manner with which \nto address one\u2019s debt, it is of limited value in terms of mitigation. Given these \nconsiderations, he has failed to show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances \nand AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant has taken the mandatory financial counseling course that is a \nprerequisite for filing bankruptcy. However, as I indicated in my analysis of AG \u00b6 20(a), \nbecause his delinquencies are ongoing, there is no clear indication that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant has not made payments on the vast majority of his debts. While he \nplans to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy as a means to resolve his debts, he has yet to do so. \nMoreover, as he decided to resolve his debts through bankruptcy after realizing that his \nclearance was in jeopardy, he failed to show that he made a good-faith resolution of his \ndebts.

He \nclaimed that he does not owe the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c because insurance should have \ncovered it. However, he provided no documentary evidence to corroborate this \ninsurance coverage. He also did not provide documentary corroboration that he \ndisputed the debt with the creditor or credit reporting agencies. It is reasonable to \nexpect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See \nISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). \nApplicant disputed owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h because he thought he \nonly had one account with this creditor, and he claimed that he paid that account. Given \nthe information in the 2018 credit report, he has two separate accounts with this \ncreditor. He provided no documentary evidence to corroborate that he paid either of \nthese accounts. He provided no evidence that he contacted the creditor or the credit \nreporting agencies to dispute either account. As the bases of his disputes with SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c, 1.f, and 1.h are not reasonable or are not substantiated by documented proof, AG \u00b6 \n20(e) does not apply. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant\u2019s financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.o \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She has never married, has no children, and no \nmilitary service. She has a high school diploma and some college. She is employed by \ndefense contractors as a Security Officer/Site Supervisor. She is seeking to obtain a \nsecurity clearance in connection with her employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to eight creditors totaling \napproximately $22,977, for delinquent accounts that have either been placed for \ncollection or charged off. \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated November 25, 2020, confirms the indebtedness. \n(Government Exhibit 5.) Since October 2020, Applicant has been employed part-time \nas a Security Officer for company 1. Since April 2015, she has been working full time \nas a Site Supervisor for company 2. \nApplicant was granted an interim security \nclearance in November 2020. \nApplicant attributes her financial delinquencies to multiple issues.  She stated \nthat there was a period of time when she lost her part-time job and was under-\nemployed.    She also describes a period in 2018 where she did not receive a paycheck \nof $1,000 to $1,300 that she was expecting during an approved period of vacation.  Her \nhours were reduced to part-time for two months, that reduced her income by $200 to \n$300 weekly. She also incurred unexpected medical expenses for plastic surgery after a \ncar accident in December 2016 that was not her fault.

She stated that she is currently meeting all of her financial obligations on time. \n(Government Exhibit 4.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debts totaling approximately $22,977. These \naccounts have either been charged off or placed for collection. \nThe evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThere is nothing in the record to demonstrate that Applicant has made efforts to \nmitigate the Government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F. Without documentary evidence \nsubstantiating her assertions that she has been making payments to the creditors, that \nshe is currently financially responsible, and that she is able to meet her future financial \nobligations, Applicant has not carried her burden of proof to establish mitigation of the \nsecurity concerns alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant stated that under-employment \ncontributed to her financial difficulties but provides nothing more. \nShe gives no \nreasonable excuse for her excessive indebtedness or why it still exists when she has \nbeen employed on a full-time basis since 2015. While Applicant claims that she has \nentered into payment agreements, and has been making payments toward her debts, \nshe has submitted no documentary evidence to support these claims. From the limited \nevidence presented, her debts remain delinquent and owing. Applicant\u2019s inaction for so \nlong reflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \nAccordingly, Applicant does not meet the requirements to access classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not present the \ntestimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept the record \nopen until January 27, 2023, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He timely \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in June 2013 and worked at various jobs in the private sector until December \n2019. He was unemployed from December 2019 to February 2020, when he was hired \nfor his current job. He was trained as a welder but is working as an electrician. (Tr. 13.) \nHe has never held a security clearance. He has never married and has no children. \nIn November 2011, while Applicant was in high school, he and two other juveniles \nwere apprehended for shoplifting packages of cold medicine from a Navy Exchange store. \nThey were issued \u201cno trespass\u201d orders and released to their parents. (GX 6.) This incident \nwas not alleged in the SOR. \nIn January 2017, Applicant was driving without insurance, a misdemeanor. He was \nfined $100 plus court costs. (GX 3 at 9.) This incident is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nIn April and May 2017, Applicant was charged with driving with a revoked or \nsuspended driver\u2019s license, a misdemeanor, on two occasions. The offenses were within \ntwo days of each other but in different locations. For each offense, he was fined and \nassessed court costs. (GX 3 at 7-8.) These offenses are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \nIn July 2017, Applicant was charged with failure to appear, a misdemeanor. He \nwas convicted and fined. (GX 3 at 6.) This offense is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nIn the summer of 2017, Applicant was charged with stealing a basketball pump \nfrom a Navy Exchange store, convicted, and sentenced to 24 hours of community service. \nIn July 2017, he was barred from the Navy base where the theft occurred. In January \n2021, he wrote a letter to the base commander, asking that the bar be lifted so that he \ncould work on the base. The base commander granted his request and lifted the bar. (AX \nD.) This incident is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but the date is incorrectly alleged in the SOR as \n2018 instead of 2017. \nIn March 2018, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana and driving \nwithout a license.

These offenses are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the marijuana incident happened because a \nfriend had left a small quantity of marijuana in his car and that he was unaware of it until \nhe was stopped by the police. When asked by Department Counsel when he had last \nused marijuana, he admitted that he used it about four months before the hearing. (Tr. \n27.) He characterized this use as a \u201cone time thing,\u201d in which he went to a party and \u201cgot \ninfluenced\u201d to use it. (Tr. 3.) This recent use of marijuana is not alleged in the SOR. \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not paid the fines and court costs for \nthe convictions alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. (GX 3 at 5.) He paid the fines and costs \ntotaling $1,596 on January 23, 2023, five days after the hearing. On January 24, 2023, \nhe paid $82 in court costs, fines, and interest. His documents do not identify which \noffenses were the basis of these fines and court costs.

(AX A.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s shoplifting in November 2011 and his most recent use of marijuana \nwere not alleged in the SOR and may not be an independent basis for denying his \napplication for a security clearance. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be \nconsidered to assess an applicant's credibility; to evaluate an applicant's evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole-person analysis. \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).

The first prong of AG \u00b6 32(a) focuses \non whether the criminal conduct was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining \nwhen conduct is recent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the evidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to \nwarrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2004). \nThe most recent criminal conduct alleged in the SOR was in March 2018, more \nthan four years ago, which is a \u201csignificant period of time.\u201d However, it was preceded by \na long history of criminal conduct. Applicant did not pay the fines and court costs levied \nagainst him until he realized that they might be an impediment to obtaining a clearance. \nFurthermore, he volunteered that he used marijuana three or four months before the \nhearing, while his application was pending. His illegal use of marijuana was irresponsible \nand undercuts any claim of rehabilitation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline J in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline J and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. p. 33.)   \n1.e. \nApplicant maintains two bank accounts in Egypt.  One of the accounts he opened \nin February 2008, the other he opened in May 2019.  He states that each account has \nabout $200 in it.  Applicant also has a credit card that he maintains in Egypt and has \ninvested $2,400 in an Egyptian bank in order to maintain it.  He uses the credit card \nwhen he goes there, and his parents make the payments on it for him.  (Tr. p. 43-44.)    \nForeign Preference \u2013 Guideline C \n2.a. and 2.b. After becoming a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in January 2015, \nApplicant primarily resided in and worked in Egypt from about April 2015 to about May \n2019. \nDuring this period he also voted in Egyptian elections in 2014 and 2018. \nApplicant stated that he is encouraged by the Egyptian Church Bishops to vote in the \nEgyptian election, especially for the current president because he helped to rebuild the \nchurches for free after they were burned down in the 2011 revolution in Egypt. While \nliving in Egypt, Applicant enrolled as a student for an on-line Master\u2019s program offered \nby a U.S. University. He traveled back to the U.S. every six months or so, when \nneeded, in order to finish his Master\u2019s degree. \nApplicant stated that he was \ndiscriminated against by the U.S. University because they deleted 13 classes from his \ntranscript that he believes he should have received credit for. He was also placed on \nacademic probation in 2015. The complete details of this situation were not presented. \n(See Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nGuideline K \u2013 Handling Protected Information \nSince coming to the United States, Applicant has worked various jobs. He has \nfound it difficult to find stable and satisfying employment that will sustain his lifestyle. In \nthe past, on several occasions, he has returned to Egypt to live with his parents \nbecause of his financial struggles in the U.S. From 2013 through 2014, while living in \nthe U.S., Applicant was financially supported by his parents in Egypt.

In March 2020, while employed for a defense contractor, Applicant was fired for \npossessing a personal device and taking unauthorized pictures with that device in a \nclassified area.  (Government Exhibit 4, and Tr. pp. 59-70.)  In August 2020, working as \na security guard, he was disciplined for starting work without wearing the required \nsecurity officer uniform.   \nFrom 2011 to the present, Applicant has worked at multiple places of \nemployment in the U.S. He has a less than stellar work history. On a number of \noccasions, he has either been released from his employment or fired for not fulfilling the \njob requirements, or disciplined for misconduct of some sort. In January 2011, working \nas a store clerk, he was fired from his employment for a mistake he made working on \nthe register. In May 2011, working as a business development representative, he was \nfired for not meeting the sales targets. In December 2012, he was fired for sleeping on \nthe job.  (See Tr. pp. 71-73.)  \nPersonal Conduct \u2013 Guideline E \n4.a.  (See discussion above under 1.d., 2.a., 2.b., and 3.a.) \nMitigation \nLetters of recommendation from various individuals who know the Applicant \ndescribe his favorable character, strong work ethic, and desire to obtain employment. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E, E, F, G, H, I, and J.)  \nA letter from a retired Lieutenant Colonel, who is currently a Director of \nInternational Business for a defense contractor, states that Applicant would be a good \ncandidate for the U.S. military. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) Another letter also indicates that \nApplicant\u2019s skills would be helpful as a military leader. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E.) Other \nletters recognize Applicant\u2019s good character and excellent technical skills. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits F through J.) \nA letter from a priest affiliated with Applicant\u2019s church back in Egypt states that \nApplicant was born and raised in the Egyptian Orthodox Church in Egypt. Applicant is \nsaid to be knowledgeable in multiple languages, and has an expertise in the Arabic \nlanguage different dialects. He is described as honest, intelligent, dependable, highly \neducated and hardworking.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit O.) \nIn assessing the heightened risk created as a result of Applicant holding a \nsecurity clearance, the Applicant\u2019s ties to a potentially hostile country are important. \nUnder the particular facts of this case, I have taken administrative notice of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation provided concerning the Country of Egypt.  Egypt is a republic governed by \nan elected president and bicameral legislature.  Although China, Russia, and Iran, stand \nout as three of the most capable and active cyber actors tied to economic espionage \nand the potential theft of U.S. trade secrets and proprietary information, countries with \ncloser ties to the United States have conducted cyber espionage and other forms of \nintelligence collection to obtain U.S, technology, intellectual property, trade secrets, and \nproprietary information.  In 2019, a black-market arms dealer, an Egyptian, who was \nalso a naturalized U.S. citizen, was found guilty in a scheme to sell and use surface-to-\nair missiles and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison.  In 2016, an Egyptian \nprocurement agent and two Egyptian citizens were sentenced after pleading guilty to \nviolation of the Arms Export Control Act in connection with the attempted shipment of \nmunitions samples from New York City to Egypt.  In 2015, Mostfa Ahmed Awwad was \nsentenced to 132 months in prison for attempted espionage relating to his attempt to \nprovide schematics of the nuclear aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford to Egypt, while serving \nas a Navy Engineer.   \nIn addition, the U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 4 travel advisory for \nEgypt, advising U.S. nationals not to travel to Egypt due to COVID 19 and Terrorism. \nTerrorists may attack with little or no warning and have targeted diplomatic facilities, \ntourist locations, transportation hubs, markets and shopping malls, western businesses, \nrestaurants, resorts and local government facilities. \nTerrorists have also targeted \nreligious sites. There were an estimated 234 terrorists attacks across the country in \n2020 of which the vast majority were claimed by ISIS-SP. There are significant human \nrights issues that include unlawful or arbitrary killings, torture, and cases of cruel, and \ninhuman and degrading treatment or punishment by the government, harsh and life-\nthreatening prison conditions, arbitrary detention and political prisoners or detainees, \npolitically motivated reprisal against individual located outside of the country to name a \nfew.  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant maintains close contact with his foreign relatives in Egypt, which \ninclude his mother and father. Despite his age and perceived independence, Applicant \nrelies heavily on his parents in Egypt for advice, guidance, and at times, financial \nsupport. After moving to the U.S., Applicant returned to Egypt to live with his parents \nwhen times got difficult. His close foreign contacts with his parents and the unique \nnature of their relationship may pose a threat and negatively influence Applicant\u2019s \ndecision making, impacting the interests and security of the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nsister, who now resides in the U.S., is not as concerning since she does not provide \nApplicant with financial assistance, nor is their relationship close. \nApplicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his foreign parents is extremely close, regular, and frequent. There \nwas no evidence presented that shows similar relationships that he has established in \nthe United States. Under the particular circumstances here, the risk-benefit analysis is \napplicable, and these contacts in Egypt do pose a significant security risk to the U.S. \ngovernment. They may manipulate, induce, or influence the Applicant to help a foreign \nperson or government in a way that is inconsistent with the U.S. interests. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts with his parents, involving a unique relationship with \nthe Applicant, could present a potential risk for foreign influence. Applicant relies on \ntheir advice and their financial support for existence. This close contact can result in a \nsituation that may create a divided allegiance. Although Applicant expresses a desire to \nmake the U.S. his permanent home, he has shown no deep and longstanding \nrelationship with or loyalties to the United States. Full mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), \nand 8(c), has not been established. Accordingly, Guideline B, Foreign Influence, is \nfound against Applicant. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he may provide information or \nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  \nForeign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. national \ninterests or when the individual acts to conceal it.  By itself: the fact that a \nU.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying without \nan objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment.  The \nsame is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or privilege of foreign \ncitizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign \ncitizenship. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military \norganization; and \n \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in any way that conflicts with \nU.S. national security interests. \nAfter becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 2015, Applicant primarily \nresided in and worked in Egypt from April 2015 to May 2019. He also voted in Egyptian \nelections in 2014 and 2018. Applicant stated that he was encouraged by the Egyptian \nChurch Bishops to vote in the Egyptian elections, especially for the current president \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nbecause he helped to rebuild the churches for free after they were burned down in the \n2011 revolution in Egypt. (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) Applicant continues to \nexercise the rights, privileges, and obligations of the Egyptian citizens. \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 including: \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; and \n(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference. \nApplicant\u2019s actions exhibit a strong foreign preference for Egypt. After becoming \na naturalized U.S. citizen, he opened two Egyptian bank accounts and voted in their \nelections in 2014 and again in 2018. Applicant is not an individual who shows loyalty to \nthe U.S. or has made a commitment to break his ties from his permanent home of \nEgypt. In fact, he remains deeply immersed in the Egyptian culture. After moving to the \nU.S., he returned to Egypt to live with his parents and to work there for several years. \nHe is also very committed to the Egyptian orthodox church, that he misses when he is \nnot in Egypt. Applicant has no real assets here in the United States. He does not own \na home here, and there is no evidence of any other assets. The above mitigating \nconditions are not applicable for mitigation here. Accordingly, Guideline C, Foreign \nPreference, is found against Applicant. \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information \nis set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information\u2013raises \ndoubt an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgement, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 34. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of protected information to \nunauthorized persons including, but not limited to, personal or business \ncontacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or \nconferences; and  \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information.   \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 35 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I \nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35 including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.   \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. In March 2020, Applicant was fired from \nhis employment for taking pictures inside of a cleared facility even after specifically \nbeing told not to do so. (Government Exhibit 4.) In fact, Applicant took pictures of the \nentire facility, which was not authorized by his employer. Applicant had completed all \ntraining in this area, and knew or should have known the rules and regulations \nimplemented to protect classified information, which was required of him as a condition \nof his employment. \nHe violated company policies and was terminated from his \nemployment. \n(Government Exhibit 5.) \nThere was no excuse for this egregious \nmisconduct. \nThis behavior is not tolerated by the DoD under any circumstances. \nAccordingly, Guideline K, Handling Protected Information, is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.   \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \nand  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.  Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \nApplicant has demonstrated a preference and commitment to Egypt.  As a U.S. \ncitizen, he moved back to Egypt to live with his parents and work.  He worked in Egypt \nfrom April 2015 to May 2019.  He has also voted in Egyptian elections in 2014 and \n2018.  Furthermore, some day, he stands to inherit an interest in his father\u2019s property in \nEgypt. \nApplicant has engaged in poor personal conduct demonstrating either a \ndeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for handling \nprotected information when in March 2020, he possessed a cell phone which was \nprohibited in the area, and took pictures of a classified area with it. Applicant knew or \nshould have known that this conduct was in violation of company security policies and \nprocedures. His behavior shows poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness. \nAccordingly, Guideline E is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B, C, K, and E, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s Egyptian parents can easily influence Applicant\u2019s actions.  He has a strong \npreference for Egypt and his Egyptian culture.  In handling protected information, he has \nviolated company policy and security rules and regulations concerning the protection of \nclassified information.  Overall, he demonstrates poor personal conduct.  Under the \nparticular facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s Egyptian parents pose a significant risk to the \nU.S. government, and he shows a strong foreign preference for Egypt.           \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence, Foreign Preference, \nHandling Protected Information, and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b. \nFor Applicant. \nSubparagraphs 1.c. through 1.e.   \nAgainst Applicant. \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. and 2.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline K:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a.  \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 38 years old, married, and has four minor children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. He is currently employed by a private company, and he has been offered a position as an engineer with a Government contractor, which is sponsoring him to apply for a security clearance. He has held a security clearance in the past, and he is seeking to renew his eligibility for a security clearance in relation to his prospective employment. (Tr. at 12-20.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) In this paragraph the Government alleged that Applicant engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. The details of the allegations are as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a. December 2020 Employment Termination. The Government alleged that Applicant was terminated from his employment in December 2020 after he tested positive for THC during a random drug test on October 20, 2020. In January 2020, Applicant began working for Company A in State 1. He claimed he was surprised that he tested positive for THC in October 2020 because he does not use marijuana or any cannabis product. He testified that a few days prior to the drug test, he had experimented using CBD oil for the first time.

DOHA assigned the case to me on August 16, 2022, \nand issued a Notice of Video Teleconference Hearing on September 12, 2022, scheduling \nthe hearing for October 3, 2022. On September 26, 2022, Applicant requested a \ncontinuance to retain an attorney to represent him in this matter. I granted his request \nand gave him two weeks to retain an attorney.

Applicant did not advise further \nabout hiring an attorney, and he represented himself at the hearing. The hearing \nproceeded as rescheduled. \nThe Government offered eight exhibits marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 8. GE 1, 2, and 4-8 were admitted without objection. Applicant objected to GE 3, \nwhich are business records of Applicant\u2019s former employer (Company A), which had \nterminated him in December 2020.

The details of the \nallegations are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. December 2020 Employment Termination. The Government alleged \nthat Applicant was terminated from his employment in December 2020 after he tested \npositive for THC during a random drug test on October 20, 2020. \nIn January 2020, Applicant began working for Company A in State 1. He claimed \nhe was surprised that he tested positive for THC in October 2020 because he does not \nuse marijuana or any cannabis product. He testified that a few days prior to the drug test, \nhe had experimented using CBD oil for the first time. He had migraine headaches, and a \nco-worker, or \u201ca few co-workers,\u201d had suggested that CBD oil had helped her/them with \nmigraines. He used the CBD oil two or three times during the week prior to the drug test, \nincluding the night before the test. He concluded that the CBD oil must have contained \nTHC. He claimed he was unaware that the CBD oil contained THC when he used it. (Tr. \nat 26-33, 67-68.) \nApplicant testified that his wife had purchased the CBD oil for her medical condition \nwhen they lived in State 2. In that state, marijuana and CBD oil with THC could be legally \npurchased. He testified that he was aware that some CBD oils sold in State 2 contain \nTHC. When Applicant and his family moved from State 2 to State 1 in about August 2019, \nApplicant claimed that the CBD oil was in a box that moved with them. He claimed that \nafter his positive drug test he inspected his wife\u2019s bottle of CBD oil. The label provided no \nindication that the CBD oil contained any THC.

He \nprovided a comment that directly contradicted Applicant\u2019s testimony of his history with \nCBD oil. He stated: \nPrior to moving to [State 1] he reported to me in an office visit that he had \nsome success with CBD for his migraines that had worsened when his son \nwas apparently molested in the school he was attending. \nAE W at 1-2. The psychiatrist also wrote, \u201cApparently the CBD oil he had purchased in \n[State 2] was not pure CBD and had some THC in it as well.\u201d AE W at 1. \nApplicant explained to his employer over the phone that he did not use marijuana \nand that the test results were due to his accidental ingestion of THC when he used CBD \noil not knowing that the oil contained THC. Applicant claimed that his employer was not \ninterested in the details of his explanation for his positive drug test. Applicant did not offer \nto show his employer the CBD oil bottle or even to send his supervisor a picture of the \nlabel as evidence of his lack of knowledge about the contents of the oil. He testified that \nhe threw the bottle away because he did not want to keep it in his home. (Tr. at 26-35. \n67-68.) \nAfter the positive drug test, Company A put Applicant on unpaid administrative \nleave, but agreed to give him the opportunity to remain with the company by signing a \nLast Clear Chance Agreement (LCCA) (AE A). Under the LCCA Applicant was required \nto complete substance abuse counseling. He met with his employer\u2019s drug counselor and \nexplained why he thought he tested positive for THC. The counselor accepted Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation and issued a letter to Company A, dated November 2, 2020 (AE B), in which \nthe counselor commented that he had provided drug counseling and concluded that no \nformal drug treatment or additional counseling was necessary. The letter stated that \nApplicant can return to work once he provides a negative drug test result to Company A. \n(Tr. at 36-38; AE A; AE B.) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor repeated that he could return to work once he provided \nevidence of a negative drug test. The supervisor instructed Applicant that he would then \ntake a second test at the on-site medical facility Company A used for drug tests. Applicant \nclaimed that the required protocol was not really laid out for him, but then he testified \nabout exactly what the LCCA and his supervisor required. (Tr. at 36-38.) \nApplicant purchased an at-home drug test that produced a pass or fail test result. \nCompany A rejected the test result and insisted that Applicant go to a testing facility and \ntake a controlled drug test. He claimed he did not know that his employer would reject a \nhome test. He claimed the process \u201cwas really confusing.\u201d He wanted his employer to tell \nhim where to get tested, and the company\u2019s response was for him to find a testing facility \nusing Google, which he eventually did.

A mistake was made, and the specimen \nlabel was a mismatch. (AE D) The test needed to be redone. He retested and received a \nnegative drug test on November 25, 2020 (AE E). On December 10, 2020, he wrote to \nhis supervisor at Company A and asked if the company had everything it needed (AE F). \n(Tr. at 33-47, 49, 53-55; AE A through AE F; Post-Hearing Statement at 2.) \nAfter all of the explanations for his delays, Applicant agreed he could have handled \nfinding a testing facility better. He kept repeating how difficult it was because he lived in \na rural area, but he also acknowledged he could have driven to a city and been tested \nthere. He testified that during the intervening time, he bought several more at home drug \ntests because he did not want to have a surprise and to get a bad test result in a controlled \nlab test. (Tr. at 41-43.) \nCompany A provided the Government a different set of facts from which Company \nA concluded that Applicant was not being truthful when he provided information to his \nsupervisor, the Company A medical facility, and during a subsequent investigation. The \ndifference had to do with the timelines Applicant provided to the company about a \ncomplicated history of his attempts to get a simple drug test completed in a timely fashion. \nCompany A was also concerned about inconsistent statements Applicant made during a \nphone interview with Applicant on or about November 18, 2020, regarding his attempts \nto obtain a drug test. Applicant described this interview \u201cas more of an interrogation that \nI was blindsided with\u201d and was unprepared to answer the questions of the representatives \nof Company A. The questions dealt with his attempts to get drug tested during the 16-day \nperiod from the drug counselor\u2019s November 2, 2022 letter to November 18, 2022. He \nprovided one timeline on the phone and then a second timeline in writing. (GE 3 at 1, 5, \n12-13.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Statement, he admitted that he misspoke during his \ninterview with Company A about the timeline of his activities during the preceding two \nweeks. He blamed his errors on his lack of opportunity to prepare for the interview. \nCompany A terminated Applicant by phone on or about December 14, 2020, and the \nparties signed a Separation Agreement, dated January 12, 2021. (GE 3 at 1, 5, 11-13, \n22-28; Post Hearing Statement at 4.) \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about his attempts to be tested in November 2020 was \nsimilarly confusing and unconvincing, creating the overall impression that Applicant was \nattempting to delay his drug test in the first half of November 2020 after having tested \npositive for THC on October 20, 2020. His testimony lacked credibility in all key respects. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Falsification in March 2021 e-QIP; Amendment to the SOR. \nApplicant failed to disclose in his e-QIP that Company A terminated him in December \n2020, about three months earlier. Section 13A of the e-QIP asked for Applicant to provide \nthe \u201cReason for Leaving\u201d his employment at Company A.

The attorney did not \nrespond to Applicant\u2019s email. He signed and submitted the e-QIP with the draft language \nunchanged. He testified that he was impatient to get the application submitted and made \na mistake. He did not satisfactorily explain his negative answer to the second question \nabout being fired. (Tr. at 55.) \nIn his Post-Hearing Statement, he provided another reason for wanting to discuss \nwith an attorney his response to this question. He claimed that he felt he needed legal \nadvice on whether he could disclose the termination under the terms of his Severance \nAgreement, which included a confidentiality clause. The confidentiality clause in Section \n8 of the Severance Agreement contains exceptions, including \u201canyone having a need to \nknow the contents of the Agreement[.]\u201d Also, the last paragraph of the Confidentiality \nsection of the Agreement makes it clear that Company A did not want Applicant to tell \nanyone he received a financial package as part of his severance. The protection sought \nby Company A in the Confidentiality Section was not addressed to the question whether \nApplicant had been terminated, since the confidentiality language was in a severance \nagreement. Among all of the numerous documents provided by Applicant both before and \nafter the hearing, he did not include his email to his attorney. Also, Applicant failed to \nmention his termination from Company A during his initial security interview on April 28, \n2021. When questioned about his termination in a follow-up interview, he provided this \nsame excuse to the Government investigator as he gave at the hearing regarding the \nNavy position language just to serve as a placeholder while he completed the rest of the \nform. (GE 2 at 3-5, 5-6; Post-Hearing Statement at 5.) \nApplicant also maintains that he was never told by Company A why he was \nterminated. Accordingly, he argued in his Post-Hearing Statement that \u201cI was not under \nthe impression that my severance with [Company A] [was] a result of being fired and/or \nleft by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct.\u201d He claims his \n\u201cNo\u201d answer to the e-QIP question regarding the end of his employment with Company A \nwas accurate. This information is contradicted by his acknowledgement in his follow-up \nsecurity interview on June 25, 2021. In that interview he discussed his termination by \nCompany A. He advised the Government investigator that he was called on December \n14, 2020, by a Company A human resources representative and advised that he was \nbeing terminated. He reported that he was told that his termination was related to incorrect \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndates and information he provided to the company regarding his drug tests in November \n2020. (GE 2 at 5, 7; Post-Hearing Statement at 6; Amendment Response at 2.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use raised \nquestions about his reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead \nto physical or psychological impairment and because it raised questions about his ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The details regarding this \nallegation are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. Positive Drug Test. The Government alleged that in or about October \n2020, Applicant tested positive for THC in a random employer-administered urinalysis. \nApplicant admitted this allegation in his Answer with an explanation about his use of his \nwife\u2019s CBD oil without knowing that it contained THC. He explained that the presence of \nTHC in his body at the time of the drug test was accidental and merely an \u201cisolated \nIncident.\u201d (Answer at 3-4.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR \nidentified six past-due debts that have been charged-off or referred to collection. The \ndebts total about $63,000. In his Answer, Applicant denied each of the allegations, but \nasserted that two of the debts are being repaid through a payment plan arranged by a \nthird party, three of the debts are under negotiations, and one debt is disputed due to a \nmismatch of the debt amounts. (Answer at 7.) \nIn or about 2018 Applicant and his wife attempted to create a start-up, defense-\ncontracting business. They were set up to commence their business when their three-\nyear-old son was molested by his preschool teacher. The family experienced a \n\u201cnightmare\u201d seeking counseling for their son and the expense of his treatment. The \ntherapist did not accept insurance coverage, so Applicant had to pay the medical bills. \nApplicant took time off from work for a period (March to November 2019) to take care of \nhis family. He moved his family from State 2 to a remote part of State 1 to help his family \nheal from their trauma. Without Applicant\u2019s income, he and his wife paid their expenses \nwith their credit cards and incurred medical bills and other debts that are alleged in the \nSOR. Less than half of the debts were incurred in connection with the start-up business \nand the rest of the debts were incurred while Applicant was not working. (Tr. at 70-76, 91-\n92.) \nIn June 2019, Applicant sought debt counseling from a credit-counseling company \n(CCC). He was advised to stop paying his debts so that CCC could negotiate payment \nplans with the creditors. He followed this advice, and the debts listed in the SOR were \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nincluded along with others in a debt-settlement program undertaken by CCC (the \nProgram).

(Tr. at 76-83, 92, 94; Answer.) \nThe current status of the debts alleged in paragraph 3 of the SOR is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 3.a. Credit-Card Account Charged Off in the Approximate Amount of \n$5,954. Applicant defaulted on this account in 2019. In June 2019, Applicant hired CCC, \nwhich advised him to stop paying this account along with others, including the five other \naccounts alleged in the SOR. Applicant is currently making payments on this debt through \nthe Program. This debt is being resolved. (Answer at 7; Tr. at 83-84, 96-97, 101; GE 1 at \n50-51; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 3; AE Q at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 3.b. Unsecured-Loan Account Charged Off in the Approximate \nAmount of $17,444. Applicant opened this account in July 2018 and defaulted on this \naccount in November 2019. The debt is listed in the CCC\u2019s December 2022 status report \nunder a different collection agency\u2019s name. The report evidences that Applicant is \ncurrently making payments on this debt through the Program. This debt is being resolved. \n(Answer at 7; Tr. at 84-85; GE 1 at 51; GE 4 at 7, 10; AE Q at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 3.c. Credit-Card Account in Collection in the Approximate Amount of \n$5,870. Applicant defaulted in paying this account in 2019. In his Answer, Applicant \ncorrectly stated that the amount alleged in the SOR is significantly different than the past-\ndue amounts shown in the Government\u2019s credit reports. It appears from the Answer that \nhe is disputing this allegation. However, the CCC\u2019s December 2022 status report reflects \nthat the amount of this debt is $10,787, which is the correct amount according to the credit \nreports, and that the debt was paid in the settlement amount of $4,316. This debt is \nresolved. (Tr. at 85-86, 96-97, 99; GE 4 at 8; GE 5 at 7; GE 6 at 3; GE 8 at 1; AE Q at 1.) \nSOR \u00b6 3.d. Credit-Card Account in Collection in the Approximate Amount of \n$9,179. Applicant defaulted in paying this account in 2019. This debt and the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e and 3.f, all owed to the same creditor, are to be resolved in the \nfuture by CCC. These debts will be resolved by CCC in the future under the Program. (Tr. \nat 86-87; GE 4 at 11; GE 5 at 11; AE Q at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 3.e.

(AE Q at 1-2.) \nWhole-Person and Other Mitigation Evidence \nApplicant provided six character-reference letters with his Answer (Answer Att. 7 \nthrough 12) and he resubmitted the same letters with his Post-Hearing Submission (AE \nH through M). The letters were prepared by friends and former co-workers. One letter \nwas written by a retired Navy lieutenant commander, and another was written by a retired \nNavy command master chief. They all praise Applicant\u2019s character. The following are \nsample comments about Applicant\u2019s character: \u201cimpeccable integrity;\u201d \u201cdevoted family \nman;\u201d \u201cpassionate and driven person;\u201d \u201ctrustworthy and deserving of a position in \ndefense;\u201d \u201can intelligent, honest, motivated and reliable person;\u201d \u201cfriendly, patient and \noutgoing;\u201d \u201creliable, loyal, trustworthy;\u201d \u201ccompetent;\u201d \u201cpatriot;\u201d \u201chard working;\u201d \u201cstrong \nmoral fiber;\u201d \u201cdedicated beyond reproach;\u201d and \u201cabsolutely deserving of the security \nclearance he seeks.\u201d (AE H through M.) \nAs noted, Applicant also provided a letter from his psychiatrist in which the writer \nexpressed his view that he believed Applicant ingested THC unknowingly with CBD oil. \nHe treated Applicant for ten years and always found him to be trustworthy. He also \nbelieves that Company A treated Applicant unfairly by terminating him. (AE W.) \nApplicant also submitted copies of 13 awards that he received from the Navy and \nhis former employer in State 2 for his excellent work. In addition, he provided a statement \nof intent in which he committed to never use illegal drugs and agreed to the automatic \nrevocation of his security clearance in the event that he broke his commitment. He also \nsubmitted a June 2022 credit report and a budget of his income and expenses. (AE N; \nAE U; AE V.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nThe record evidenced established that Applicant was terminated by Company A \nfor his unreliability and lack of candor. Applicant was well aware that his interview with \nrepresentatives of Company A on November 18, 2020, did not go well, and he could not \nget his timeline of his drug-testing attempts straight or consistent. He was terminated for \nnot properly complying with the LCCA and for not being honest about his attempts to be \ndrug tested in November 2020. The record evidence establishes the potentially \ndisqualifying condition set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(f). \nThe evidence also established that Applicant deliberately falsified information in \nthe e-QIP about his termination from Company A. Applicant offered a complicated \nexplanation that lacked credibility about his e-QIP response to the employment \ntermination question being a temporary \u201cplaceholder\u201d while he unsuccessfully sought \nlegal advice. He also claimed that he forgot to change his response to the question to the \ntruth before submitting the e-QIP with patently false, recent information. On this point, I \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnote he could have used the truth as a \u201cplaceholder\u201d while he sought advice on how he \nshould respond and avoided the risk of potentially submitting a false statement to the \nGovernment. As noted, he did not submit a copy of his email to his attorney to substantiate \nhis claim that he was seeking advice about how to respond to the e-QIP question. \nOverall, I found Applicant\u2019s demeanor to be lacking sufficient credibility to support \nall of his claims to make them believable, honest, and true. His testimony about his actions \ndid not appear to be honest. I note that Company A also found that Applicant lacked \ncandor in his descriptions about his delayed efforts to take a drug test. In addition, his \nclaim that he did not believe he had been terminated simply made no sense and was \ncontradicted by his own admissions to the Government investigator. The record evidence \nand my credibility assessment of Applicant\u2019s testimony establish the disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b6 16(a). \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s personal misconduct and falsifications in the e-QIP: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant has not carried his burden to establish either of the above mitigating \nconditions. The employment termination alone could be considered isolated conduct, \neven though he was terminated for lack of candor. However, the falsification in his e-QIP \nrenders the termination even more credible. The falsification occurred just a few months \nafter Applicant\u2019s termination. His dishonesty on two occasions along with his general \npattern of dishonesty in his testimony render it likely that future untrustworthy conduct will \noccur. In fact, he did not disclose his employment termination during his initial security \ninterview. This renders AG \u00b6 17(a) inapplicable. Applicant\u2019s overall actions cast doubt on \nhiss reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not mitigated security \nconcerns under this guideline. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes one condition that raises security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug. \nApplicant tested positive in October 2020 for THC. He claims that his ingestion of \nTHC was unknowing because he was using a bottle of CBD oil purchased by his wife in \nState 2 for treatment of her medical condition. He also claims that he first used CBD oil \nshortly before his drug test. Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist contradicted Applicant on both points. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s demeanor in presenting his claim that his THC exposure was \naccidental and that he was so unlucky as to be tested for drug use during the same week \nlacked credibility. The fact that he discarded the container of CBD oil after his positive \ndrug test was not the action an innocent person would take. The container was his best \nevidence to support his claim with his employer that he unknowingly ingested THC. I \nconclude that Applicant ingestion of THC was not accidental. The above disqualifying \nconditions are established. \nI note that a continuous evaluation report in the record, dated June 18, 2020 (GE \n7), reflects that Applicant held national security eligibility at that time. The SOR does not \nallege that Applicant used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, and the record \nis undeveloped as to whether Company A was a U.S. Government contractor and had \nassumed responsibility for Applicant as a clearance holder. Accordingly, I make no \nfindings on the issue of whether Applicant used an illegal drug while holding a clearance. \nThe evidence of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use shifts the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. The guideline includes two \nconditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s \nalleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use occurred only about two and one-half years ago. Due to \nApplicant\u2019s false reporting of the frequency of his use of CBD oil with THC, it cannot be \nconcluded that his drug use was infrequent or unlikely to recur. His psychiatrist reported \nthat Applicant had been purchasing and using CBD oil since before he moved from State \n2 to State 1 in 2018. Lastly, Applicant\u2019s fabrication of a story that his wife purchased the \nCBD oil that he used in October 2020 casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established in that Applicant provided a written statement of \nintent affirming that he intends to abstain from all drug involvement and acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of his national security \neligibility. This mitigating condition, however, is only partially established because \nApplicant does not acknowledge that he knowingly used an illegal controlled substance. \nOverall, the evidence is insufficient to permit a conclusion that Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his use of an illegal drug. Paragraph 2 is found against \nApplicant. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

These debts establish the foregoing disqualifying conditions and shift the burden \nto Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes the following four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate\nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAll of the above mitigating conditions have been fully established. Applicant \nincurred a number of debts arising out of the most unfortunate of circumstances, the \nsexual abuse of his child by a nursery school teacher. This created chaos in the family\u2019s \nfinancial plans including disrupting Applicant\u2019s business plan with his wife to start a U.S. \nGovernment contracting business and forcing Applicant to relocate to another state. He \nhas acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAbout three years before the issuance of the SOR, Applicant entered into an \nagreement with CCC to resolve his outstanding debts. Since then, CCC has shown that \nit is performing its job of negotiating and paying off Applicant\u2019s debts as promised in its \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontract with him. Applicant has honored his commitment to make monthly payments to \nCCC to fund the settlements. He is adhering to a good-faith effort to resolve the six debts \nalleged in the SOR and a number of other debts. There are clear indications that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved. Applicant\u2019s debts arose under highly \nunusual circumstances and are unlikely to recur. His actions do not cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Overall, Applicant has fully established \nmitigation of the security concerns raised under this guideline. Paragraph 3 is resolved in \nfavor of Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Further comment is warranted. Applicant \nrepeatedly testified with excuses for his conduct that lacked credibility. His testimonial \ndemeanor also lacked credibility, and his testimony about his actions at times made no \ncommon sense. His termination by Company A was due to his unreliable behavior. He \ndeliberately provided false information in the e-QIP regarding the only security sensitive \nissue raised by his responses to the e-QIP. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a. through 3.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 45-year-old married man with two children, ages 11 and 15. He is a veteran of the U.S. Army, serving from 1996 to 2002, when he was honorably discharged. He has held a security clearance since 2006. (Tr. 14) He has been working for a defense contractor as a database administrator since 2019. (Tr. 14, 32) Per the SOR and the Amended SOR, Applicant incurred approximately $50,000 of delinquent debt. The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a, as duplicated in subparagraph 1.h, totals approximately $10,000. (Answer at 1) It is a deficiency remaining from a car that Applicant purchased in the early 2010s. (Tr. 60) Applicant voluntarily surrendered the car in approximately 2016 after he could no longer make the car payments after a death in the family compelled him to provide financial support to some extended family members. (Tr. 21) Within a year of surrendering the car, in 2017, Applicant traveled to another country for a six-to-ten day vacation. (GE 1 at 17) In approximately 2021, Applicant began reaching out to the creditor to ascertain the status of the debt. (Tr. 60) In October 2022, he received a letter from the current creditor informing him that the file was closed on this debt, and that they had terminated collection action.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 31, 2021, Department of Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant security clearance eligibility. The DCSA CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 21, 2021, admitting the allegations and \nrequested a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on September 29, 2022. \n1 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThat day, DOHA issued a notice of video teleconference hearing, scheduling the hearing \non October 25, 2022. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, I considered \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, together with six Government Exhibits (GE), marked and \nincorporated into the record as GE 1 through GE 6, and nine Applicant exhibits (AE), \nmarked and incorporated into the record as AE A through AE I. At Applicant\u2019s request, I \nextended the record through November 9, 2022, to afford him the opportunity to submit \nadditional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted three additional exhibits, marked \nand incorporated into the record as AE J through AE L. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nNovember 3, 2022. \nPreliminary Ruling \nAt the close of the hearing, I granted a motion filed by Department Counsel to \namend the SOR, adding the following subparagraph: \n1.k. Applicant owes $3,000 for tax year 2020 to the federal government. (Tr. \n86) \nThis amended allegation conforms to Applicant\u2019s testimony. (Tr. 85; Directive \u00b6 E3.17) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 45-year-old married man with two children, ages 11 and 15. He is a \nveteran of the U.S. Army, serving from 1996 to 2002, when he was honorably discharged. \nHe has held a security clearance since 2006. (Tr. 14) He has been working for a defense \ncontractor as a database administrator since 2019. (Tr. 14, 32) \nPer the SOR and the Amended SOR, Applicant incurred approximately $50,000 of \ndelinquent debt.  The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a, as duplicated in subparagraph 1.h, \ntotals approximately $10,000. (Answer at 1) It is a deficiency remaining from a car that \nApplicant purchased in the early 2010s. (Tr. 60) Applicant voluntarily surrendered the car in \napproximately 2016 after he could no longer make the car payments after a death in the \nfamily compelled him to provide financial support to some extended family members. (Tr. \n21) Within a year of surrendering the car, in 2017, Applicant traveled to another country for \na six-to-ten day vacation. (GE 1 at 17) In approximately 2021, Applicant began reaching out \nto the creditor to ascertain the status of the debt. (Tr. 60) In October 2022, he received a \nletter from the current creditor informing him that the file was closed on this debt, and that \nthey had terminated collection action. (AE K) Applicant previously owned another car that \nwas repossessed in 2006 for failure to pay the loan. (Tr. 68) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b, totaling $4,204, stems for a furniture loan. \nApplicant resolved it in October 2022. (AE H) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c, totaling $1,917, is a delinquent loan. \nApplicant opened it in 2015 and was originally scheduled to have satisfied it by January \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2017. (AE G) Although he did not satisfy it by the agreed-upon date, he was current on the \namount due as of October 2022. (AE G) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.d, totaling $1,364, was owed to an insurance \ncompany. On October 19, 2022, Applicant confirmed his contention that this debt was paid. \n(AE F) \nSubparagraph 1.e, totaling $1,090 is a loan Applicant opened to finance a vacation. \nAs of January 2022, this account was paid in full. \nThe debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g are timeshare maintenance fees. \nApplicant admits that he purchased a timeshare for a one-bedroom property, but explained \nthat when he canceled the one-bedroom property agreement and upgraded it to a two-\nbedroom property, the company never cancelled the maintenance fees for the original \npurchase, and instead, billed him maintenance fees for both the one-bedroom property and \nthe two-bedroom property. (Tr. 29-31) Applicant brought this discrepancy to the attention of \nthe timeshare company, and it confirmed that he no longer owes money for either property. \n(AE J) \nSubparagraph 1.i is a medical bill, totaling $2,154 stemming from emergency \nmedical treatment Applicant received in the spring of 2019. (Tr. 27) Applicant receives \nmedical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) for a service-connected \ndisability. (Tr. 27; GE B) Per the agreement, the VA should have covered the bill, but they \ndid not receive it from the hospital. (Tr. 27; GE B) Neither Applicant, nor the VA has been \nable to contact the current collection agent for the bill. (Tr. 28) Applicant disputed the bill \nwith a credit reporting agency and it was removed from his credit report. (Tr. 74) \nApplicant owes delinquent state income tax for tax years 2010 and 2011, as alleged \nin subparagraph 1.j. As of January 2020, the delinquency totaled $8,243. (GE 5 at 1) That \nmonth, Applicant entered a payment agreement whereupon he was to pay $244 per month \nover the next 36 months to satisfy the account. (GE 5) Applicant has not made payments \nconsistently. (Tr. 77) He attributed his failure to make consistent payments to \u201clittle small \nissues [that] kind of arose and [that] kind of made [him] broke for the payment plan.\u201d (Tr. \n78) The month Applicant entered the payment plan, he spent $2,000 on an overseas \nvacation. In January 2021, he spent $2,000 on another overseas vacation, and in August \n2021, he spent $2,000 on an island vacation for his tenth wedding anniversary. (GE 1 at \n42) In August 2022, Applicant financed the purchase of a luxury vehicle through an $82,000 \nloan. (Tr. 48)   \nApplicant is indebted to the federal government for tax year 2020 in the amount of \n$3,000, as alleged in subparagraph 1.k. (Tr. 85) As of the hearing date, he had not \ndeveloped a payment plan. (Tr. 85) \nApplicant earns $150,000 annually. (Tr. 33) Applicant\u2019s wife has been working for \nthe past two years at a job earning $30,000. (Tr. 37) Before then, she was unemployed for \napproximately two years.

(Tr. 89) One week before the hearing, on \nOctober 18, 2022, Applicant enrolled in financial counseling. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems and his delinquent federal and state income tax \ndebts trigger the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history \nof not meeting\u2019s financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19f), \u201c . . . failure to pay annual Federal, \nstate, or local income  tax as required.\u201d  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nApplicant has satisfied the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e and he \nis current on the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c. I resolve these allegations in his favor. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant successfully disputed the timeshare debts, alleged in subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g, \nand the medical debt, alleged in subparagraph 1.i.

Specifically, Applicant chose to \neschew his payment agreement with his state tax authority to pay his delinquent 2010 and \n2011 taxes, in favor of purchasing luxury items, including multiple vacations and the recent \npurchase of an $82,000 personal vehicle. Furthermore, his decision to enroll in financial \ncounseling a week before the hearing does not mitigate the underlying security concern. \nUltimately, Applicant\u2019s satisfaction of many of the debts, and his investigation into the \nstatus of some of his other debts trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(d) for those debts, but is \ninsufficient to carry the burden, when considered in tandem with the circumstances \nsurrounding how Applicant incurred the debts and how long the state tax debts have been \ndelinquent. I conclude he has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcern, \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and it does not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 43, married his wife in 2008. They have two minor children. He attended a U.S. military college from June 1999 through March 2004, without obtaining a degree. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree from another college in September 2004. He was employed by the same defense contractor from June 2006 until November 2018, when he began working for his current employer. He has maintained a security clearance since 2004. (GE 1; AE I; Tr. at 28, 29, 57, 68) Background Applicant was separated from the U.S. military college for misconduct involving alcohol. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions in April 2005. The sole debt alleged in the SOR involves the recoupment of his U.S. military college expenses. In December 2020, the debt was reported in collection status, with a balance of $203,260, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant admitted he was obliged to repay the debt. However, he disputed the alleged balance on the basis that it did not reflect the payments he has made toward the debt. (GE 1, 2; AE A) Debts owed to the DOD are collected by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 authorizes the accrual of interest, administrative fees, and penalties on unpaid debts over 30 days old, and referral to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for federal income tax refund offset. After initial collection efforts are exhausted by DFAS, the delinquent account is transferred to the U.S. Departmen",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 7, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn September 17, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested \na decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On December 17, 2021, \nApplicant requested that this matter be converted to a hearing before an administrative \njudge. The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2022. On September 8, 2022 and \nSeptember 12, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified the \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparties that the hearing was scheduled for October 5, 2022.

AE M was previously attached to the Answer. \nApplicant and two witnesses testified. I appended to the record Applicant\u2019s exhibit list as \nHE I. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open until November 4, 2022, to allow him \nthe opportunity to submit additional information. He timely provided additional documents \nthat I admitted as AE N through V, without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non October 19, 2022. On June 20, 2023, for good cause and without objection from the \nGovernment, I reopened the record, at Applicant\u2019s request, to receive additional \ndocuments that I admitted as AE W and X, without objection. I appended to the record \nApplicant\u2019s two post-hearing exhibit lists, including accompanying explanations, as HE II \nand III. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 43, married his wife in 2008. They have two minor children. He \nattended a U.S. military college from June 1999 through March 2004, without obtaining a \ndegree. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree from another college in September 2004. He \nwas employed by the same defense contractor from June 2006 until November 2018, \nwhen he began working for his current employer. He has maintained a security clearance \nsince 2004. (GE 1; AE I; Tr. at 28, 29, 57, 68) \nBackground \nApplicant was separated from the U.S. military college for misconduct involving \nalcohol. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions in April 2005. The \nsole debt alleged in the SOR involves the recoupment of his U.S. military college \nexpenses. In December 2020, the debt was reported in collection status, with a balance \nof $203,260, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant admitted he was obliged to repay the \ndebt. However, he disputed the alleged balance on the basis that it did not reflect the \npayments he has made toward the debt. (GE 1, 2; AE A) \nDebts owed to the DOD are collected by the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService (DFAS). The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 authorizes the accrual of \ninterest, administrative fees, and penalties on unpaid debts over 30 days old, and referral \nto the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for federal income tax refund offset. After initial \ncollection efforts are exhausted by DFAS, the delinquent account is transferred to the \nU.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) for more aggressive collection efforts, \nincluding an administrative wage garnishment (AWG). Upon transfer, the Treasury is \nauthorized to collect a processing fee, which is 30% of the unpaid balance, in addition to \nthe accrued interest. (AE S at 298-299) \nIn May 2005, the U.S. military college notified Applicant of his obligation to repay \nthe debt, with a balance of $193,986.

Sometime thereafter, Applicant negotiated a hardship \nrepayment plan with DFAS to repay the debt, which was renewed on either an annual or \nsemi-annual basis. In July 2015, DFAS found him in default of the repayment plan and \ntransferred the debt, with a balance of $203,261, to the Treasury. Upon transfer, the \nbalance of the debt increased to $264,239 after the Treasury assessed its 30% fee. (AE \nA at 4; AE S at 292, 300; Tr. at 30-31, 53-54, 57-59) \nDFAS History \nApplicant maintained that he never defaulted on the repayment plan and \nconsistently made timely monthly payments via written checks to DFAS, totaling \napproximately $18,000. The payment amounts, which ranged from $25 to $325 per \nmonth, were determined by DFAS based upon financial information he provided in \nhardship packets that he mailed to DFAS \u201cevery six months or every year.\u201d He never lied \nor misled DFAS about his income or expenses. (AE C; Tr. at 30-31, 54-55, 57-63, 76-77) \nGiven the scant records available to Applicant (due, in part, to his own record \nkeeping, and, in part, to the sparse responses he received to requests for records) and \nthe passage of time, he was unable to proffer the specific details of his DFAS repayment \nplan and payment history. He recalled, generally, that DFAS initially set the monthly \npayment amount at $25, then increased it to $50, and to $100, until settling at $325. \nFollowing its approval of each hardship packet, DFAS notified him of the new payment \namounts in statements sent by mail. (AE O, W, X; Tr. at 30-31, 47, 59-63) \nApplicant recalled that he started making payments to DFAS in about 2005; and \nthat, after he stopped receiving statements sometime in 2014, he continued to send $325 \nchecks to DFAS for a \u201ccouple of years.\u201d The record indicates that his payments likely \nbegan sometime after he received the August 2006 notice from DFAS and continued until \nabout July 2015, when the debt fell into default status. (Tr. at 30-31, 77) \nApplicant denied having knowledge of the default status of the debt until he \nreceived the July 2015 notice. He later learned that DFAS revoked his hardship status in \nabout August 2013, which resulted in the debt falling into default status. At the time, he \nthought \u201ceverything was fine,\u201d because DFAS continued to cash the $325 checks he sent, \neven after he stopped receiving statements from DFAS. In hindsight, he attributes the \nrevocation of his hardship status to not being aware that the process for submitting his \nhardship packets had changed to an online platform in about 2012 or 2013. (GE 1 at 38; \nAE C at 20; Tr. at 30-31, 46-47) \nApplicant proffered documents corroborating that he paid a total of $16,984 to \nDFAS before the debt was transferred to the Treasury. Those documents also \ncorroborated some other details of his DFAS payment history, including: 1) a hardship \nplan approving monthly payments of $100 effective April 2008 through October 2008, 2) \na hardship plan approving monthly payments of $325 effective as of January 2013; 3) \n$325 payments he made in January 2013, November 2014, and December 2015; 4) two \n$325 payments he made in October 2015; 5) a $500 payment he made in December \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n2015; and 6) federal income tax refund offsets in May 2015 ($1,399), April 2017 ($439), \nand May 2019 ($833). (AE A at 8; AE O at 256; AE Q at 272, 273; AE R at 281, 290, 291; \nAE S at 300) \nTreasury History \nApplicant contacted the Treasury immediately upon receiving notice of the transfer \nfrom DFAS in July 2015. The Treasury advised him of the following four options: 1) pay \nthe debt in full; 2) pay the debt via a three-year repayment plan with monthly payments \nof about $7,000 (which was the maximum period offered); 3) proceed with collections \nactions to include an AWG, or 4) get the debt recalled to DFAS. In November 2015, a \nprivate collection agency notified Applicant that it was collecting the debt, with a balance \nof $263,491, on behalf of the Treasury. In January 2016, the private collection agency \nnotified Applicant that it planned to issue an AWG to collect the debt, with a balance of \n$262,666, which decreased due to an unexplained reduction in interest and fees. (AE S \nat 293-294; Tr. at 31-33, 47-48, 63-65, 94) \nOn the basis that Applicant could not afford to either pay the debt in full or the \nmonthly payment required by the three-year repayment plan, he continued his efforts to \ncontest the default status of the debt and the AWG, and get the debt recalled to DFAS. \nHe argued that he was not notified of the default or the transfer, and that the transfer \ncreated hardship, largely due to the Treasury\u2019s 30% fee. He wrote letters to DFAS and \nhis U.S. senator, negotiated with the Treasury\u2019s private collection agency, and requested \nan administrative determination to contest the AWG before a DFAS hearing officer. He \nhired a law firm to assist him with these efforts. (AE C at 22-24; AE S at 295-296; AE U; \nTr. at 31-33, 47-48, 63-65, 102) \nNone of Applicant\u2019s efforts were successful. He was unable to negotiate a \nreasonable repayment plan with the Treasury\u2019s private collection agency, which \nsuggested that he \u201cmax out\u201d his credit cards to pay the debt in full. Although it accepted \na good-faith $500 payment, the private collection agency only credited his account with \n$250. He presumed that they took the other half for their fee. After a thorough review of \nthe matter, in January 2016, his senator concluded that DFAS had worked diligently with \nApplicant regarding the matter. In April 2016, the DFAS hearing officer validated the debt \nand its default status. The DFAS hearing officer concluded that the balance of $262,666 \n(including the Treasury\u2019s 30% fee) was correct, and that the AWG should proceed in an \namount not to exceed 15% of Applicant\u2019s disposable pay. Since then, the debt has \nremained in collection status with the Treasury, which requires that he repay the debt via \nthe AWG. The Treasury has not offered an alternative voluntary repayment arrangement. \n(AE C at 28; AE S at 300; AE X at 355; Tr. at 31-33, 47-48, 64-65, 94, 102) \nThe DFAS hearing officer\u2019s decision included the following relevant findings of fact: \n1) Applicant made $16,984 in direct payments to DFAS before the default; 2) he had \nample opportunity to repay the debt at a more reasonable rate, but failed to adhere to the \nterms and conditions of the repayment plan; 3) the repayment plan was cancelled \nbecause he became delinquent with his payments; 4) he was provided more than the \nallowable time to make arrangements to repay the debt; 5) he provided no evidence that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwarranted a new repayment plan; and 6) the appropriate collection actions and fee \naccruals were taken in accordance with applicable law. (AE S at 297-301) \nThe DFAS hearing officer advised Applicant of various other options for relief, \nincluding filing a request for reconsideration of financial hardship through the Treasury \nDepartment; petitioning the Board of Correction of Military Records (BCMR) if he \ndisagreed with the information reported on his military record; or petitioning for a waiver \nof indebtedness if he felt that an injustice had occurred. The record did not indicate \nwhether Applicant availed himself of any of these options. (AE S at 301) \nIn May 2016, the Treasury issued the AWG to collect a balance of $262,666. The \nAWG amount is calculated by the employer based on a formula provided by the Treasury. \nApplicant\u2019s former employer calculated the monthly AWG amount as $1,495, with which \nit complied from May 2016 through November 2018. The AWG was not in place between \nDecember 2018 and December 2022, due to Applicant\u2019s change in employment and not \nto any inaction on his part. He timely notified the Treasury of his employment change, \nand his current employer of the AWG. The Treasury advised him that the AWG would \nautomatically transfer to his current employer, and that the transfer process could take up \nto one year. The Treasury did not require him to make direct payments during the period \nwhen the AWG was not in place. (AE D at 29-33; AE E, N, O; AE Q at 268-269, 271-273; \nTr. at 33, 35-36, 66, 68-70, 97-98, 100-101, 125-126) \nIn October 2019, the Treasury effected the AWG transfer to Applicant\u2019s current \nemployer. However, it immediately suspended the AWG because Applicant disputed the \nbalance of $218,319, arguing that payment records showed he was entitled to a credit of \n$2,821. In December 2021, upon advice of counsel in connection with this security \nclearance proceeding, Applicant made a one-time direct payment of $1,495 to the \nTreasury, to demonstrate his good-faith intention to repay the debt. In January 2022, \nwhen the Treasury issued its response to Applicant\u2019s dispute, the AWG immediately \nresumed through his current employer. His current employer calculated the bi-weekly \nAWG amounts as: $811 from January 2022 through February 2022; $806 from February \n2022 through mid-May 2022; and $842 beginning in mid-May 2022. He proffered \ndocuments corroborating his current employer\u2019s compliance with the AWG through \nNovember 2022. (AE H, M; AE Q at 275-278; Tr. at 48, 70-71, 93-95, 97, 99-100) \nThe record did not indicate the reason for the Treasury\u2019s delayed response to \nApplicant\u2019s dispute between October 2019 and January 2022. However, it can reasonably \nbe attributed to either the COVID-19 pandemic or some other circumstance beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. During that period, he called the Treasury \u201csix or seven times\u201d to \ncheck on the status. In its response, the Treasury informed Applicant that his dispute was \nconstrued as a request for a new AWG hearing to which he was not entitled. The Treasury \ndid not otherwise address the credit, which Applicant does not expect to receive. (AE Q \nat 275-278; Tr. at 103-105) \nApplicant explained why he has not made, nor intends to make, additional direct \npayments to the Treasury (besides the one made in December 2021) to help reduce the \nbalance of the debt.

Third, he has no obligation to \npay more than the income-driven amount of the AWG. Finally, he has not been offered \nany option to resolve the debt besides by paying it in full. To that end, he is working to \nsave enough money to pay the debt in full \u201cin the next few years.\u201d In the meantime, he \nintends to continue reducing the balance of the debt through the AWG. He estimated that, \nat the current bi-weekly AWG amount, the debt will be fully resolved through the AWG in \nabout seven years. (Tr. at 32, 37, 38-39, 52, 66-67, 70, 75, 78, 79-81, 88-89, 107-108) \nIncome and Expense History \nApplicant has only experienced delinquent debt one other time. Sometime in 2012, \nhe fell behind in his payments on the first and second mortgage loans on a rental property \nhe owned. He lost a renter and exhausted his savings trying to stay current on his \nmortgage payments. After unsuccessfully attempting to refinance the loan or sell the \nproperty, he fully resolved both loans in 2013 via a short sale to which both lenders \nagreed. He has owned his current home since October 2010. (AE X at 354; Tr. at 71-73) \nIn a July 2012 financial statement submitted to DFAS, Applicant reported a \n$10,389 monthly income, including $8,889 wages and $1,500 rental income, and monthly \nexpenses totaling $10,078. In a February 2016 financial statement submitted to DFAS, \nhe reported a $13,218 monthly income, consisting solely of his wages, monthly expenses \ntotaling $12,820, two savings account balances totaling $25, and non-delinquent credit-\ncard debt totaling $33,069. (AE R at 282-289; AE S at 302-305) \nIn May 2016, Applicant took out a $41,000 hardship loan from his 401(k) retirement \naccount to pay non-delinquent debt and other expenses so that he had sufficient funds \nfor the AWG amounts taken from his paycheck. At the time, he had about $40,000 of non-\ndelinquent credit-card accounts and car loans. During a July 2017 security clearance \ninterview, he reported a $7,488 monthly net income, after payment of the $1,484 Treasury \nAWG, and a $598 net remainder. In November 2018, he began repaying his 401(k) loan \nvia monthly payments of $753. As of the hearing, the 401(k) loan was fully paid. He \nestimated that he paid about $47,000 or $48,000 in total to repay the 401(k) loan. (AE V; \nAE X at 356; Tr. at 39, 66-67, 74-75, 85-86) \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary has steadily increased from about $50,000, when he first \napplied for the hardship repayment plan with DFAS (date unclear from the record), to \n$180,000, as of February 2021. He attributed his improved financial situation over the last \nseveral years to the variable commission he received in addition to his salary. He used \nhis commissions of about $22,000 in 2019, about $40,000 in 2020, and $100,000 in 2021 \nto decrease his reliance on credit; eliminate non-delinquent credit-card debt and two car \nloans; and to increase contributions to his retirement and savings accounts. He took these \nmeasures to ensure that he is able to fully resolve the debt and maintain an overall \u201cgood \nfinancial status.\u201d In his April 2022 monthly budget, Applicant reported a no credit-card \ndebt, a gross salary of $7,837, a net remainder of $2,135, a $1,684 payment for the \nTreasury AWG, a $470 retirement account contribution, and a savings account balance \nof $50,000.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following warrant discussion: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe fact that Applicant has not fully resolved a substantial federal debt that he has \nbeen obliged to pay since 2005 is not alone disqualifying. The AGs do not require an \napplicant to immediately resolve or pay each debt alleged in the SOR, or to be debt free; \nnor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be resolved first. The focus \nof security clearance adjudications is to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. In this case, the key issue is whether Applicant has responsibly managed \nthe repayment of the debt and his finances. \nApplicant demonstrated responsible action during the period when he was making \ndirect payments to DFAS. Although he failed to fully corroborate each of his direct \npayments, the record otherwise established that he complied with his repayment \nobligation through July 2015, when DFAS determined that he defaulted on the debt. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s protestations to the contrary, the record established that he did, in \nfact, default on his DFAS repayment plan, which resulted in the debt being appropriately \ntransferred to the Treasury for collection. The fact he has only made one direct payment \nto the Treasury since July 2015 requires further examination. \nThe balance of the debt has largely been reduced by the AWG and federal income \ntax refund offsets. The AWG was issued following Applicant\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to \neither negotiate a voluntary repayment plan with the Treasury, to dispute the default \nstatus and the AWG, or to have the debt recalled to DFAS. The AWG was in effect with \nApplicant\u2019s former employer from May 2016 through November 2018; and has been in \neffect with his current employer since January 2022. He was involved in good-faith \nnegotiation and dispute efforts during the period when payments were not made from July \n2015 through April 2016. The suspension of the AWG from December 2018 through \nDecember 2022 was not due to inaction on Applicant\u2019s part. He may have been better \nserved by making additional voluntary direct payments to the Treasury or by paying more \nthan the hardship plan and AWG amounts calculated by DFAS and the Treasury. \nHowever, the record did not establish that he was either required to do so, or that his \nactions were unreasonable or motivated by a willful violation of his obligation to repay the \ndebt. The record indicates that payments are reasonably expected to continue until the \ndebt is paid in full, whether through the AWG or by Applicant directly. \nApplicant has actively worked to resolve the debt within his means since he was \nfirst notified about the debt. His plan to continue complying with the AWG to reduce the \nbalance of debt, until such time as he has amassed sufficient funds to pay the debt in full, \nis reasonable. In the meantime, he has fully resolved non-delinquent debts, accumulated \nsavings, and managed his finances responsibly. While payments made through the AWG \ncannot be considered voluntary, the Treasury has required him to pay the debt via the \nAWG and has not offered an alternative voluntary repayment option. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI found Applicant\u2019s testimony sincere and credible. He demonstrated good-faith \nefforts to responsibly manage the repayment of the debt. He made meaningful progress, \nover an extended period, in resolving the debt. His track record of payments and \nresponsible actions lead me to conclude that he will follow through with his plan to fully \nresolve the debt. I have no lingering doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) are established to mitigate the Guideline F \nconcerns alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nthe debt alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

This misconduct was documented by several of his \npast employers and shows Applicant\u2019s unreliability. \nApplicant stated that he has \nstruggled with immaturity, lack of integrity, and poor judgment. \nLetters of recommendation submitted on Applicant\u2019s behalf attest to his \nrecognized talent, character, and leadership abilities. He is described by those who \nknow him as professional, confident, great motivator, team player, and leader. He is \nknown to strive hard to deliver excellence at the highest level. \nHe is highly \nrecommended for any position available to him. (Attachments to Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nSOR.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a while-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not\nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n \n(3) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources;  \n   (2) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nApplicant has a history of violating company policies and procedures in the \nworkplace. His misconduct demonstrates a pattern of immaturity, dishonesty, and rule \nviolations. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual specifically \nconcerning security processes.  Upon being made aware of the requirement to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and \ntruthfully. \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAlthough some of the information in the record is quite dated and may have \nchanged, the Applicant\u2019s history of misconduct that occurred at his previous places of \nemployment remains factual, relevant, and most concerning. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. A security clearance is a privilege and not a right. To be found \neligible, it must be clearly consistent with the national interests to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance. The decision must be made in accordance with the DoD Directive \nand its guidelines. Based upon the information presented, from 2011 to at least 2017, \nwhile possessing a security clearance, Applicant established a pattern of violating \ncompany policies and procedures, and ignored security rules and regulations at various \nplaces of employment. While on probation working for the Department of Defense, he \nwas terminated for this misconduct. Furthermore, in 2016, he deliberately lied to the \nGovernment on his security clearance application in an effort to conceal his misconduct. \nHis character and integrity remains highly questionable. His pattern of misconduct was \negregious and shows poor judgment, unreliability, immaturity, and untrustworthiness, \nwhich prevents him from being eligible for access to classified information. \nThe \nPersonal Conduct guideline is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Personal Conduct security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on March 9, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 68-year-old registered nurse and clinic manager employed by a \nfederal contractor since September 2019. She served in the Navy from March 1987 to \nSeptember 2007, was honorably discharged and retired as an E-7. She honorably served \nin the Army Reserve, National Guard, and Navy Reserve prior to commencing active duty \nin the Navy. She held a security clearance while on active duty in the Navy. She was \nemployed in various nursing positions from December 2007 to September 2017, except \nduring periods of unemployment from January 2016 to July 2016, January 2017 to July \n2017, and October 2017 to August 2019. (GE 1, GE 2; AE G, H; Tr. 33-44) \nApplicant earned associate and bachelor\u2019s degrees in nursing in 1997 and 2015, \nrespectively. She married for a fifth time in June 2021 and has no children. Her fourth \nhusband died from cancer in November 2017 after 29 years of marriage; three previous \nmarriages ended in divorce. (GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 33-43, 75) \nThe SOR alleges a failure to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years \n2012 through 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a federal tax debt of $4,267 for tax year 2012 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b), and nine delinquent credit accounts totaling $10,262. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.k). In \nApplicant's answer to the SOR (SOR Response), she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.k with \nexplanation and, admitted in part and denied in part SOR \u00b6 1.a with explanation. \nApplicant attributes her failure to timely file federal tax returns and other financial\nproblems to unstable employment, unemployment, depression, medical issues, custody \nissues regarding her nephews, and forgetfulness. (GE 2 at 42, GE 3 at 6-7; Tr. 27-28, 41-\n42, 47, 54-55) She noted that from October 2017 to August 2019 she was unemployed \nbecause she had to care for her terminally ill husband, that he and two other family \nmembers died during that timeframe, and that she experienced medical issues that \nprevented her from returning to work. (Tr. 27-28, 41-42) She said that her former \nhusband\u2019s abuse prior to his illness caused her emotional instability, that his death in \nNovember 2017 resolved \u201cthe issue causing [her] depression,\u201d and that in 2018 she \ndecided to get her finances in order.

Applicant admitted that she failed to timely file federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2012 through 2017 but said that she had filed returns for tax years 2017 to \n2019 and was working with a tax-resolution service to file delinquent returns. (SOR \nResponse) She submitted federal income tax account transcripts reflecting that she had \ntimely filed a return for tax year 2018, but had not timely filed returns for tax years 2012, \n2014 through 2017, and 2019. (GE 3 at 32-40) The IRS prepared substitute returns for \ntax years 2012 and 2014, and Applicant\u2019s subsequent claims resulted in adjustments to \nher account for both tax years in 2021. (GE 3 at 32-35). She filed returns for tax years \n2015 through 2017 in 2021 and filed a return for tax year 2019 on October 26, 2020, 11 \ndays after a six-month extension to file expired. (GE 3 at 36-41) She testified that she \nfiled a federal income tax return for tax year 2013 but could not locate a copy of the return \nand had not received an account transcript from the IRS. (Tr. 44-45) Her tax account \ntranscript reflected that she had not filed a return for tax year 2020 as of October 26, \n2021, 11 days after her six-month filing extension expired. (GE 3 at 41) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: delinquent federal income tax debt of $4,267 for tax year 2012. \nApplicant admitted the tax debt and entered into a payment agreement with the IRS in \nSeptember 2021.

Applicant admitted the allegation, noting that the vehicle was sold\nafter being repossessed and noted that the delinquency was not reflected in a December\n2021 credit report. (SOR Response) September 2019 and April 2020 credit reports show\nthe auto loan account was opened in June 2017 with the last account activity in 2018,\nand as an involuntary repossession with a past-due amount of $2,104 and balance of \n$24,648.  (GE 5 at 3, GE 6 at 1) Applicant testified that she contacted the creditor in 2017\nbecause she could not afford to pay the loan due to her husband\u2019s funeral costs. (Tr. 27-\n28, 58-59) She said that she settled the debt for approximately $2,104 after the \nrepossessed vehicle was sold and would look for documentation.

(Tr. 79- 82; GE \n3 at 44, 46) \nAny derogatory information not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes; however, it may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nThe standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nSEAD 4, \u00b6 E.4. A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must \npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for assignment to a public trust position. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish that she has a history of \nfailing to file federal income tax returns, as required, and other financial problems dating \nback to 2012. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(f) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through \n2017 and 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). She subsequently filed past-due returns for each of those \ntax years except tax year 2013. She has provided no evidence that she has filed a federal \nincome tax return for tax year 2013. Though not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also failed \nto timely file a federal income tax return for tax year 2020. \nApplicant entered into a payment agreement for her $4,267 federal tax debt for tax \nyear 2012 in September 2021, made payments until June 2022 totaling $1,631, and an \n$82 overpayment was applied to the tax debt in June 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). She has provided \nno evidence of payment on the remaining federal tax debt, or of any voluntary payments \nunder the payment agreement since June 2022. \nApplicant has resolved the credit account debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.i\ntotaling $3,388. She has not provided sufficient evidence that she has resolved the debts\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.j, and 1.k totaling $6,874. She submitted a credit report from\nDecember 2021 that did not reflect the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.j and\n1.k. However, evidence that some debts have dropped off recent credit reports is not\nmeaningful evidence of debt resolution. See ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July\n7, 2016) (citation omitted). The absence of unsatisfied debts from an applicant\u2019s credit\nreport does not extenuate or mitigate a history of financial difficulties or constitute\nevidence of financial reform or rehabilitation.

She also made a $294 \npayment on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d in December 2021, but has not provided \ndocumentary evidence of additional payments or resolution of that debt. It is not \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.j, and 1.k because she provided \ninsufficient documentary evidence of a good-faith effort to repay those creditors or \notherwise resolve those debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established for past-due federal income tax returns, which have been \nfiled for tax years 2012, 2014 through 2017, and 2019. It is not established for her past-\ndue federal income tax return for tax year 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) or her federal tax debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b). Applicant provided insufficient evidence that she filed a return for tax year 2013 \nand that she made payments on her delinquent tax debt since June 2022. Applicant\u2019s \neventual compliance with most of her tax obligations does not end the inquiry. A public \ntrust adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The fact that Applicant has filed most past-due \nfederal returns \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of her [trustworthiness] based on \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. \nBd. Oct. 30, 2014). Her long-term procrastination regarding her federal income tax \nreturns, lack of evidence that she filed a return for tax year 2013, untimely filing of her tax \nyear 2019 return, and evidence that she did not timely file a return for tax year 2020 \nindicate that she lacks the good judgment and reliability required of persons granted \neligibility for public trust positions.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, military \nservice, work history, family history, medical and mental health issues, improvements in \nher credit records and the entire record. I also considered that she timely filed her tax \nyear 2018 federal income tax return, has filed most delinquent federal income tax returns, \nmade payments on her tax debt, and resolved several delinquent accounts totaling \n$3,388. However, Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax filing issues and tax debt persist with no \nevidence of voluntary payments on her tax debt since June 2022. She has also not \nprovided sufficient evidence that she has resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, \n1.j, 1.k totaling $6,874 or has a reasonable plan to do so. \nA public trust adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. \nBd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not held to a standard of perfection in her debt-\nresolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an [she] \nact responsibly given [her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent \nto effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). Applicant\u2019s \ngood intentions have not yet evolved into a reasonable and credible plan that includes \ntimely filing of her federal income tax returns and the satisfaction of debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d, 1.j, and 1.k. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations. \nAccordingly, I conclude that she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant her eligibility for a public trust position. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d, 1j, 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

(GE 1; Tr. 29-31, 52, 58) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent accounts totaling $22,251. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.h) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all SOR allegations with explanation. \nIn her June 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had been delinquent on her \nmortgage from June 2017 to June 2018.

Applicant denied the \nallegation. (Answer) She stated that she had entered a payment agreement with the \ncreditor that required monthly payments of $229.59 until July 2024, that the account \nbalance had been reduced to $6,887, and she submitted a receipt for a $229.59 payment \nin December 2021. (Answer at 1, 3, attachment A) She testified that her debt was \noriginally over $11,000, that she had made every monthly payment required by the \npayment plan and would fully resolve the account after several more payments.

Applicant denied the \nallegation and stated that she had made payments in accordance with a payment \nagreement. (Answer at 2-3) She submitted evidence that she had entered a payment \nagreement in August 2020, that the account balance was $669.48 as of December 27, \n2021, and that she had authorized the company to debit her bank account for the January \n2022 payment. (Answer at attachment B) She testified that she had made all required \nmonthly payments under the payment plan and had almost paid off the debt. (Tr. 33-35, \n71-72) Credit reports from July 2020, April 2021, and July 2022 show the account had \nbeen charged off for $2,295 with declining past due balances of $2,295, $1,530, and \n$191, respectively.

These debts \nare resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit account charged off for $1,141. Applicant denied the \nallegation and said that she disputed the account because the company refused to honor \na warranty for furniture that broke shortly after purchase. (Answer; Tr. 35-37, 73-74) She \nsaid that she would pay the debt if necessary to protect her job, but that she had not and \ndid not want to pay the debt.

(Answer) She said that she paid the mortgage in full when she sold her house \nin August 2021 and submitted a settlement statement dated August 6, 2021. (Answer at \n1, attachment F) She testified that she had missed several mortgage payments after her \ndivorce and while trying to straighten out her finances. She said that she sold her home \nto pay off the mortgage and some other debts, and that it took some time because she \nwas financially responsible for her children at that time. (Tr. 25-26, 37-40, 54, 66-67, 74-\n75) An April 2021 credit report shows the account as past due in the amount of $7,975 \nwith a total mortgage balance of $146,791, and that foreclosure proceedings had been \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninitiated.

(Answer; Tr. 28-29, 76-78) She submitted evidence this debt \nwas resolved in August 2020. (Answer at attachment H) This debt is resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s income has increased, and her financial situation has improved. Her \ngross annual salary was about $68,000 in 2016, ranged from $77,000 to $93,000 over \nthe next several years, was $125,000 in April 2020, and is currently $132,000. She said \nthat she has a remainder of about $2,500 a month after expenses. She has about $6,300 \nin the bank, $5,000 in stocks, $45,000 in a retirement account, and about $1,000 in stock \noptions. She has rented a house since selling her own home. She purchased a 2013 \nmodel-year vehicle for her daughter, and a 2018 model-year vehicle for herself. (Tr. 25-\n26, 42-52, 58-59, 66-69, 75; GE 2-5) \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. She said that she has a written \nbudget but did not submit a copy. During the hearing I informed Applicant of the \nimportance of documentary evidence of debt payments, contact with creditors, and efforts \nto resolve or otherwise address delinquent debts. (Tr. 22-26, 62-85) \nI found Applicant\u2019s responses and demeanor at the hearing to be credible and \nconsistent with someone who was reliably telling the truth. I also found her explanation \nthat a debt not alleged in the SOR but reported as charged off and then paid off was \nattributable to an online company\u2019s delayed retrieval of a trade-in vehicle credible. (Tr. \n26-28; GE 2 at 13, GE 3 at 6) After reviewing the entire record, I find that her hearing \ntestimony is largely corroborated by documentary evidence submitted by the government \nand evidence that she submitted with her Answer. She credibly responded to all questions \nand was keenly aware of the significance of resolving her debts. \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information.

The \nfollowing mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are established. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was \ndamaged by circumstances partially or fully beyond her control. She acted responsibly by \nprioritizing and resolving her delinquent debts. She entered into and complied with \npayment agreements for two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b), sold her home and paid off her \ndelinquent mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.f), paid several smaller debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d, and 1.g-\n1.h), and resolved a disputed debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e).   \nThere are clear indications that her financial problems are being resolved and are \nunder control. Her financial circumstances have improved, and she understands the \nsecurity implications of delinquent debt. Her debts were incurred under circumstances \nmaking recurrence unlikely, and her conduct does not cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established because Applicant did not receive financial \ncounseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record, including \nApplicant\u2019s work history and security clearance history, and that her financial problems \nwere caused, in part, by circumstances beyond her control. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not held to a standard of perfection in \nhis debt-resolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that \n[she] act responsibly given [her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for \nrepayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2017). Applicant has taken reasonable actions under her unique financial circumstances \nto address her delinquent debts and has established a \u201cmeaningful track record of debt \nreduction.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Applicant has \nmitigated security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEric C.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are directly related to her employment issues. She \nwas periodically laid off when there was no work or when a contract changed. When \nthat occurred, she would fall behind on her debts and then attempt to pay them when \nshe returned to full-time employment. She resolved six non-SOR debts totaling $2,701 \nand three SOR debts totaling $1,793, for a total of $4,494, before the SOR was issued. \nHer student loans are paused and she is in the process of applying for an income-driven \nrelief plan. She still has debts to pay, but she credibility testified that she is committed to \npaying all of them. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant established that she has a plan to resolve her financial problems, and \nshe took significant action to implement that plan. She acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay her debts. Her finances do not cast \ndoubt on her current judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.1 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n1 The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the \nissues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s finances.  \n6 \n",
