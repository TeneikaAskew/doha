Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and hearing testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate alcohol consumption and personal conduct concerns. Criminal \nconduct concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold \na sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 4, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct \nguidelines the DoD could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility \nfor granting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge \nto determine whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 3, 2020 and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 6, 2021. A hearing was scheduled for June 8, \n2021, by video teleconference, and heard on the same date. At the hearing, the \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of two exhibits. (GEs 1-2) Applicant relied on seven \nexhibits (AEs A-G) and two witnesses (including himself). The transcript was received \non June 28, 2021. Following the hearing, an additional exhibit (a substance use \nassessment) was located and admitted without objection as AE H. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record as needed. For good cause shown, \nApplicant was granted 14 days to supplement the record. The Government was \nafforded two days to respond. Applicant elected not to supplement the record. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline G, Applicant allegedly (a) was arrested in August 2016 for \ndriving under the influence (DUI); (b) consumed alcohol throughout the day preceding \nhis scheduled personal subject interview (PSI) in February 2019; and (c) was observed \nby an authorized national background investigator as having arrived for his scheduled \nFebruary 2019 PSI smelling of alcohol. Allegedly, Applicant was well-aware of DoD \nrequirements of avoiding consumption of alcohol products before appearing for a PSI or \nother official event. \nUnder Guideline J, Applicant allegedly was arrested in April 2016 in another state \nafter pistol-whipping his wife in the head. Allegedly, he was charged with battery-family \nviolence and cruelty to children as a result of the reported incident. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) provided materially false statements to \nan investigator of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in a February 2019 \ninterview when he falsely stated he had stopped consuming alcohol and smoking \ncigarettes shortly before arriving in a foreign country because he wanted to better his \noverall health. Allegedly, he (a) concealed his consumption of alcohol prior to his \nscheduled OPM interview and (b) provided materially false statements to an OPM \ninvestigator in a February 2019 OPM interview when he falsely stated that he emailed \nthe investigator the day of his interview to explain his failure to meet at his scheduled \ninterview time, omitting his real reason for being late to his interview due to his \noversleeping attributable to his being up late and consuming alcohol. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covered \nby SOR guidelines G and J with explanations and clarifications. He claimed he did not \nconsume alcohol \u201cuntil 1:00 AM\u201d on the day scheduled for his OPM interview. Further, \nhe claimed he had consumed beer the night before his scheduled OPM interview. And, \nhe denied the allegation containing the language \u201cpistol whipping\u201d his wife with a \nhandgun. Applicant denied the falsification allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b \nwithout any explanations. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old armed guard for a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant \nand material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in December 2016 and has one child (age three) and two \nstepchildren from this marriage. (GE 1; Tr. 64-65) While Applicant and his wife are still \nmarried, they live separately and share time and financial support of their daughter as \nco-parents without any court guidance. (AE H; Tr. 74-78, 83-86) Applicant attributed his \nestranged relationship with his wife to his wife\u2019s infidelity. (Tr. 79) \nApplicant earned his general educational diploma (GED) after returning with his \nfather from overseas Army deployment. (Tr. 62-63) He completed on-line \ncorrespondence courses between March 2008 and May 2008, but earned no degrees or \ndiplomas. (GE 1) He reported no military service. \nBetween October 2018 and December 2020, Applicant was employed by another \ndefense contractor. (GEs 1-2 and HE 1) After separating from this defense contractor, \nthe employer terminated its sponsorship of Applicant for a security clearance. (HE 1) \nFrom January 2009 to October 2018, he was employed by other non-defense \ncontractors in various jobs. (GE 1; Tr. 64-72) His prospective employer is holding a job \nfor him, conditioned on his obtaining a security clearance, and is sponsoring him for a \nclearance. (GEs 1-2 and AE E and HE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption and arrest-history \nBoth before and after their marriage in December 2016, Applicant and his \ngirlfriend, and later wife, consumed alcohol regularly when together. (Tr. 79-80) \nAcknowledging the adverse effects the drinking had on their relationship, Applicant \nattributed their drinking to their persistent arguing over their finances and \u201cjust bad \nsituations.\u201d (Tr. 79) \nApplicant was involved in two alcohol-related incidents in 2016. (GEs 1-2 and AE \nD) The first incident occurred in August 2016 and resulted in his arrest and domestic \nviolence charges. (GEs 1-2 and AE D; Tr. 50-51, 80-82) The charges involved battery-\ndomestic violence, for which Applicant was charged with pistol-whipping his girlfriend at \nthe time in her head with his handgun (a 9mm Glock 19 postil). (GEs 1-2 and AE D; Tr. \n112-116) Court records document the misdemeanor charges being nolle prossed in \nSeptember 2016 based on his girlfriend\u2019s unwillingness to press her charges. (AE D)  \nThe stories of the parties to the 2016 domestic violence incident differ \nconsiderably. According to Applicant\u2019s account taken from a summary of his personal \nsubject interview (PSI) with an agent of the OPM, he and his girlfriend at the time \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbecame embroiled in a heated domestic dispute. (GE 2) Arguments raged over \nApplicant\u2019s losing his job the previous month and his finding a text message from his \ngirlfriend to one of Applicant\u2019s friends. As the arguments between the two intensified, he \ngrabbed his unloaded pistol and began striking his girlfriend in the temple region of her \nhead, causing her to bleed without losing consciousness. (GE 2) \nStill conscious from the blow to her head, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend called police, who \nanswered the call at their residence. (GE 2) Police who responded to the girlfriend\u2019s call \ncanvassed the home and took statements from the participants before arresting \nApplicant and charging him with battery-family violence and cruelty to children. (GE 2) \nAppearing in court for his scheduled September 2016 court hearing, Applicant \nwas advised that the domestic violence charges filed against him were nolle prossed. \n(AE D) No reason was assigned for the Government\u2019s dropping of its charges. (AE D) \nWhile documented police accounts do not assign any alcohol role to Applicant\u2019s actions, \nApplicant admitted to drinking two to three beers before striking his girlfriend. Without \nmore information, alcohol cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor in assessing \nApplicant\u2019s actions associated with the domestic violence incident. (GE 2 and AE D) \nAsked about the domestic violence incident at hearing, Applicant employed a bit \nof semantical spin on the pistol-whipping characterization attributed to him by arresting \npolice. (GE 2) Denying any intent to physically injure his girlfriend when waving his \nunloaded pistol around her head, he claimed he checked the wrong box (approving the \nwording in the OPM investigator\u2019s summary of his PSI). He assured that he did not use \nthe pistol-whipping words attributed to him in his PSI summary. (Tr. 116) Acknowledging \nhe had consumed two or three beers during the evening of the August 2016 incident, he \ndismissed and minimized his attributed actions. Meaning no harm to his girlfriend, he \nclaimed in his hearing testimony that he accidentally grazed her head with his pistol \nwhile waving the pistol in the air to convince her he was serious about the points he was \nmaking (\u201cmore like a jab or just talking with my hands\u201d), that caused \u201ca little cut on the \nside of her head.\u201d (Tr. 81, 114) \nResolving all close interpretations in Applicant\u2019s favor, his hearing revisions \ncannot be fairly reconciled with the intentional or reckless endangerment language \nattributable to him in his PSI summary. That his girlfriend and wife to be later declined to \npress charges against him does not change or alter the plain import of the pistol-\nwhipping words he employed in his PSI summary to describe the actions attributable to \nhim. (GE 2; Tr. 73-74) Under these carefully considered circumstances, inferences are \nwarranted that Applicant\u2019s actions directed at his girlfriend during the charged August \n2016 domestic violence encounter were either intentionally or recklessly initiated with \nthe foreseeable likelihood of inflicting bodily harm upon her and endangering his child. \nIn August 2016, shortly after his domestic violence incident with his girlfriend had \nbeen court-discharged, Applicant was involved in another alcohol-related incident. \nPreceding his arrest, Applicant was driving his girlfriend home following a meeting with \nher probation officer on her prior DUI citation, when he stopped at a corner store to \npurchase a can of beer. (GE 2; Tr. 83, 117-119) Upon returning to his car, he \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproceeded to drive his girlfriend to a local store. While waiting for his girlfriend to return \nfrom her store-shopping, he opened the can of beer and consumed the contents. \nOn his way home from the store, Applicant stopped at another store and \npurchased a second can of beer. After leaving the store, Applicant consumed his \nsecond can of beer and continued to run errands before returning home. (GE 2) While \nreturning home, he was stopped by police for swerving in a lane. Upon observing the \nopen can of beer in Applicant\u2019s car, the officer arrested Applicant for DUI. (GE 2). \nWhether Applicant consumed only the two beers that he described in his PSI, or \nmore, preceding his domestic violence encounter with his girlfriend is unclear. In a \nsubsequent consultation with a licensed substance abuse counselor in April 2021, the \ncounselor credited him with consuming six beers before his 2016 DUI arrest. (AE H) \nThis attributed consumption level contrasts sharply with his 2019 PSI account to the \nOPM investigator. Afforded multiple opportunities to do so, Applicant never made any \nattempt to clarify or reconcile these two competing accounts. Compare Applicant\u2019s \naccount in GE 2 with his substance abuse counselor\u2019s finding in AE H. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s recurrent history of revising or minimizing his accounts \nwhen challenged, inferences are warranted that the more expansive drinking version \nattributable to him by his substance abuse counselor provides the most reliable account \nand is the accepted version for evidentiary purposes. Appearing in court in September \n2016 to answer the DUI charges, Applicant pled guilty to the charges and was \nsentenced to a year of probation. (GE 1 and AE D) Probation conditions did not include \nan alcohol counseling requirement or drinking restrictions. \nApplicant\u2019s PSI appearance \nIn February 2019, Applicant made a scheduled visit to a Middle Eastern country \nto meet with an OPM investigator for an interview on his security clearance. (GE 2; Tr. \n88-89) Beginning around 3:30 PM on the day before his scheduled February 2019 PSI, \nhe consumed alcohol repeatedly over a seven-hour period (to around 1:00 AM the \nfollowing morning), and became intoxicated.  (GE 2; Tr. 89-90) \nAdversely affected from his excessive drinking the previous day, Applicant woke \nup late in a state of panic and failed to make his scheduled 9:00 AM PSI interview.

(GE 2 and AE H; Tr. 127-129) \nApplicant is credited with receiving alcohol abuse counseling in March 2021 from \na licensed substance abuse counselor. (AE H) After taking information from Applicant \non his drinking history (dating to age 21), the counselor administered two tests, one a \nMichigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) and the other an Alcohol Use Disorders \nIdentification Test (AUDIT). Both tests were designed to gauge any alcohol problems \nwith Applicant that needed addressing with treatment and medication. (AE H) Based on \ntest results and other information obtained from Applicant, the counselor found no \nsymptoms of alcohol disorder within the previous 12 months assessed. (AE H) \nBased on her findings, the substance abuse counselor concluded that there is no \nclinical documentation to indicate Applicant is a problem drinker, either currently or in \nthe past. (AE H) She made no further recommendation. Because the counselor\u2019s \nhistorical account of Applicant\u2019s drinking did not include his acknowledged drinking \npreceding his 2016 domestic violence arrest or 2019 PSI, it cannot be accurately \ndetermined as to what influence these two incidents might have affected or influenced \nher overall evaluation of Applicant. At best, only limited weight can be accorded her \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s current alcohol condition. \nApplicant\u2019s PSI omissions and misstatements \nPrior to his February 2019 PSI interview with an OPM investigator, Applicant \nemailed the investigator on the day of his scheduled interview to explain his failure to \ntimely meet with the investigator for his 9:00 AM interview. In the email, he told the \ninvestigator that someone had robbed him, and he had a police report detailing the \nrobbery incident. (GE 2) \nFollowing his questioning by the investigator about the robbery incident, \nApplicant admitted that his email account was false and was meant to provide cover for \nhis oversleeping following his late night of abusive drinking. (GE 2) After assuring the \ninvestigator that he would try to obtain the police report covering the robbery incident, \nApplicant \u201cdid not follow up with any police report.\u201d (GE 2) \nThrough an ensuing email, Applicant advised the OPM investigator that he had \nbeen unable to obtain any documentation of the police report. (GE 2) Viewed in their \nentirety, Applicant\u2019s verbal and email responses to the OPM investigator who \ninterviewed him reflect concerted attempts to provide false, inaccurate, or incomplete \ninformation to shield from the investigator his alcohol-related reasons for oversleeping \nand missing his scheduled 9:00 AM PSI interview. \nApplicant was confronted again by the PSI investigator who interviewed him in \nFebruary 2019, this time over his statement to the investigator that he had stopped \nconsuming alcohol and smoking cigarettes shortly before arriving in a foreign country on \nhis employment assignment.

(AE C) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThe AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                        \n \n \n          \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nAlcohol Consumption \n The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the \nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 21. \n \n      \n \n \n       \nCriminal Conduct \n    The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

AG \u00b6 30. \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n The Concern:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative processes.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

On the strength of the evidence documented \nin the record, two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the alcohol consumption guideline \napply: DCs \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use or \nwhether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder\u201d and 22(c), \n\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless \nof whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder,\u201d are applicable to the \nfacts of record in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nLittle is known about Applicant\u2019s early pre-2016 drinking history, or whether he \nabused alcohol at any time in his life after he reached the age of majority before his \ncited 2016 DUI. Because there is so little data in the record to assess Applicant\u2019s pre-\n2016 drinking habits, reliable, evidence-based inferences of the nature and extent of his \npre-2016 drinking practices cannot be drawn. What is clearly evident from the record is \nApplicant\u2019s succession of excessive drinking incidents between 2016 and 2019.  \nFor lack of sufficient data and information on Applicant\u2019s pre-August 2016 \ndrinking history, assessing recurrence risks becomes much more difficult to assess and \nevaluate. More information is needed from Applicant to determine whether excessive \nconsumption of alcohol was a transitory problem for Applicant, or represented a series \nof incidents over a more prolonged period of recurrent alcohol abuse. \nEvaluation by Applicant\u2019s substance abuse counselor in 2021 produced no \nassessment that took into account his domestic violence incident, his pre-August 2016 \ndrinking practices, or his abusive drinking preceding his 2019 PSI interview. As a result, \nvery limited weight can be assigned to his substance abuse assessment. \nAlcohol abuse disorder, when evidenced by recurrent alcohol-related incidents, \nhas historically been held by the Appeal Board to pose a risk that a person under the \ninfluence of alcohol could mishandle or fail to properly safeguard classified information. \nSee ISCR Case No. 95-0731 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 1996); ISCR Case No. 94-1081 at 5 \n(App. Bd. August 1995).

While the charges were ultimately nolle prossed in 2017 after his girlfriend \ndeclined to support the charges, the actions were never refuted by Applicant with any \nprobative evidence of his own. Applicant\u2019s actions warrant the application of one of the \nconditions (DCs) of the criminal conduct guideline: \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence (including, but not \nlimited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted,\u201d \nA considerable period of time has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s domestic violence \nincident in 2016. Since the offense, Applicant has married his girlfriend and avoided any \nfurther such incidents. He has exhibited maturity and responsibility in his work and \nfulfilling his family responsibilities at home. His progress entitles him to the mitigation \nbenefits of one of the MCs under Guideline J. MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed \nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nPrior to the 2016 domestic violence incident at bay, Applicant never before \nengaged in any physical misbehavior with his girlfriend or other female individual. Since \nthe incident, he has avoided any recurrent physical confrontations with the girlfriend \nwho he married several months following the incident. Applicant has provided sufficient \nevidence of his learning enough from the incident to avoid any recurrent incidents in the \nfuture. Based on a consideration of all of the evidence presented, criminal conduct \nconcerns are mitigated. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s repeated falsification of \nmaterial facts preceding and during his February 2019 PSI. Misrepresented facts \nreflecting lapses in candor and judgment include his claims that (a) he was robbed and \nhad a police report in his possession to validate his claimed reasons for being late to his \nscheduled 9:00 AM PSI and (b) that he had abandoned drinking altogether preceding \nhis scheduled PSI. Neither of Applicant\u2019s false accounts were voluntarily corrected \nbefore he was confronted and challenged by the interviewing OPM investigator. \nApplicable DCs are \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation; or concealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health professional \ninvolved in making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \n11 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n       \n \n \n              \n \n \n       \n \n                   \n \ndetermination, or other official government representative,\u201d and 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse \ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be \nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulation, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is not limited to, \nconsideration of: .  . .  . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and .  . .\u201d \nBased on the evidence presented, none of the mitigating conditions apply to the \nfacts of Applicant\u2019s case. Providing false information to the OPM investigator scheduled \nto interview him in February 2019 not only undermined the investigator\u2019s ability to \nascertain Applicant\u2019s past and current drinking habits, but revealed serious lapses of \ncandor and judgment by Applicant. Implicit in Applicant\u2019s failure to provide truthful and \ncandid answers to the OPM investigator about being late for his 9:00 AM interview is his \nfailure to cooperate with the investigator during a national investigative process. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of abusive drinking and lapses in candor in \nexplaining his reasons for being late to his scheduled February 2019 PSI are \nincompatible with his holding a security clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit \nfor his civilian contributions to the defense industry, his contributions are not enough at \nthis time to overcome his alcohol abuse history and lapses in candor in his accounts to \nthe assigned OPM investigator about his drinking history and robbery incident. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude alcohol consumption and \npersonal conduct concerns are not mitigated. Criminal conduct concerns are mitigated \nprimarily due to the passage of time.

(Items 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling about $8,600 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c); \nthat Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns as required for tax years 2016, \n2017, and 2019; (SOR \u00b6 1.d); he did not file his State A income tax return as required \nfor tax year 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and he did not file his State B income tax returns as \nrequired for tax years 2017 and 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nApplicant admitted owing the three delinquent debts. He stated that he could not \npay his debts because he was living beyond his means. He did not submit any evidence \nof payments. (Items 1, 3-6) \nApplicant denied the tax allegations. When he submitted his Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) in July 2018, he reported that he did not file his \nfederal and State B income tax returns in \u201cYear: 2017 (Estimated),\u201d because he did not \nreceive all of his W2 forms, and he owed \u201c$250 (Estimated).\u201d He wrote that he had not \ntaken any action out of fear of penalties, and that he was unsure who to talk to about \nfinding out amounts owed and payment options. He provided similar information during \nhis background interview in January 2019. (Items 1-3) \nWhen he responded to Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \ninterrogatories in November 2020, Applicant provided a copy of an IRS account \ntranscript for 2016 that showed that a federal tax return was not received for that tax \nyear. He reported that all of his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2016 through \n2019 had been filed. He stated that his federal income tax returns for 2016 and 2017 \nwere filed in 2016 and 2017, and that his state tax returns for 2016 through 2018 were \nfiled in 2016, 2017, and 2018. (Item 3) \nApplicant apparently made a common error and confused the tax year with the \nyear the returns were filed. Returns cannot be filed until the year following the tax year. I \nbelieve he may have made the same error on his SF 86 and during his background \ninvestigation. That would explain why the unfiled 2016 returns were reported as \u201cYear: \n2017 (Estimated).\u201d \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was ever required to file State A income tax \nreturns. There is no reliable evidence that Applicant failed to file his 2017 and 2019 \nstate and federal income tax returns.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including three delinquent debts. \nHe did not file his 2016 federal income tax return as required. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was ever required to file State A income tax \nreturns. There is no reliable evidence that Applicant failed to file his 2017 and 2019 \nstate and federal income tax returns. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns as required \nfor tax years 2016, 2017, and 2019. The part of the allegation that relates to tax years \n2017 and 2019 is also concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not submit any documentary evidence of payments toward his \ndelinquent debts or that his 2016 federal income tax return was filed. Failure to comply \nwith tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and systems.

None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

The FORM included six items of evidence listed within Section I of the \nFORM. He received the FORM on June 2, 2021.

Alternatively, he was advised that if he \nobjected to the entire PSI on the ground that it was unauthenticated by a government \nwitness, it would not be entered into evidence. Applicant did not object, and the exhibit is \nadmitted into evidence as Item 4. \nFindings of Fact \nParagraph 1 of the SOR contains three allegations under alcohol consumption \n(Guideline G). Applicant admitted the alcohol consumption allegations. Paragraph 2 \nalleges that the alcohol conduct set forth under paragraph 1 also represents criminal \nconduct (Guideline J).

While driving home, he was stopped and arrested \nfor DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a misdemeanor. He was found guilty, fined $1,000, ordered to \nperform 100 hours of community service, and complete one year of probation. One of the \nconditions of probation was completion of 15 alcohol classes in the same program he \ncompleted in 2010. He satisfied all terms of probation. He was not assessed or treated \nfor alcohol use. (Item 3 at 28; Item 4 at 2) \nApplicant committed his third DUI in April 2018. Before his arrest, he was drinking \nat a bar celebrating a friend\u2019s promotion. During his drive home, he was stopped and \narrested for DUI and reckless endangerment, first degree (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Both offenses \nwere misdemeanors. (Item 4 at 3) In December 2018, he was found guilty of DUI and \nsentenced to six months in jail, suspended after four months. He was placed on probation \nfor 18 months (not two years as set forth in SOR) until May 2020. He was found guilty of \nthe reckless endangerment charge. He received a one-year suspended jail sentence and \nwas placed on probation for two years until December 2020. Probation was terminated \nearly in February 2020. (Item 6 at 1-2) (Item 6 at 1) \nNo evidence was provided to substantiate Applicant\u2019s claim of abstinence from \nalcohol since the April 2018 arrest. He indicated that he made some bad choices and, in \nthe future, he did not intend to drink more than the legal limit for intoxication, nor did he \nintend to break the law. He did not see a pattern of alcohol abuse because each DUI was \npreceded by a celebratory occasion in which he did not intend to abuse alcohol. As a \nprecautionary measure, Applicant purchased a breathalyzer in case he has a drink in the \nfuture so that he can avoid alcohol-related incidents. (Item 4 at 3) \nThough Applicant denied alcohol interfered with his work performance, his social \nrelationships, or his finances, he acknowledged that he would be on leave from his \nemployment beginning in January 2019 to serve probable jail time for the third DUI offense \nhe committed in April 2018. That anticipated leave most likely interferes with Applicant\u2019s \nwork performance because he would not be present to carry out his job responsibilities. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n3 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that he \nadmits or denies. The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a \nfavorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption  \nThe security concerns of the guideline for alcohol consumption are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes the condition that may be disqualifying: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder.  \nApplicant\u2019s three alcohol-related incidents away from work in a nine-year \nperiod between 2009 and 2018 demonstrate a lack of judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness. On each occasion, Applicant consumed an excessive amount of \nalcohol, then used poor judgment by driving a car while under the influence. In the \nmost recent DUI, Applicant recklessly endangered other drivers and pedestrians \non area roads because of his alcohol-related conduct. Accordingly, the alcohol-\nrelated behavior establishes the disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 22(a). \nAG \u00b6 23 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it  \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations.  \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHaving weighed the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I conclude that \nneither one of the mitigating conditions apply. Though Applicant claims he has not \nused alcohol since his third DUI in April 2018, he has furnished no independent \nevidence of a changed lifestyle to infer or suggest an established pattern of sobriety \nor control over alcohol use. Transporting a breathalyzer kit to be used when he \ndecides to consume alcohol can hardly be considered an effective method of \navoiding future alcohol-related incidents. Significantly, during the period from his \nApril 2018 DUI arrest to his discharge from probation in May 2020, his abstinence \nwas obviously influenced by the possibility of incarceration for violating the terms \nof his probation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) do not apply. \nCriminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in AG & 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nThe potential disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 32 is: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual=s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence \u2026 of criminal conduct, regardless, of whether the individual \nwas formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAG \u00b6 31(b) applies to Applicant\u2019s admitted 2009 DUI conduct even though \nhe was not convicted of the offense. All three DUI offenses in 2009, 2015, and \n2018 raise security concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \nAG & 32 lists two pertinent mitigating conditions that may be applicable in this \ncase: \n(a) so much time has passed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community development. \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInsufficient time has passed for me to justify with complete confidence that \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct is clearly in the past. AG & 32(a) does not \napply for the same reasons that were discussed under AG & 23(a). \nApplicant receives some mitigation under AG & 32(d) because he complied with \nthe terms of his 2009 first DUI offense by completing the alcohol education classes and \nsatisfying other first offender conditions. Regarding the 2015 and 2018 DUI convictions, \nhe paid the appropriate court fines and served the requisite jail time or completed the \nalcohol education classes. However, he furnished no character evidence from his job or \naway from his job that addresses his judgment, trustworthiness or reliability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for alcohol consumption in the \ncontext of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 35 years old. Though he did not supply any character evidence \nconcerning his job performance, he has been employed by the same contractor for 10 \nyears. \nApplicant\u2019s nine-year history of DUI conduct away from work between 2009 and \nat least 2018, culminating in the commission of a reckless endangerment offense in 2018, \nindicates poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness under the alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct guidelines. Even though he may not have intended to \nabuse alcohol on the celebratory occasions in 2015 and 2018, the prior special occasions \nprovided the necessary motivation for him to engage in a pattern of alcohol use to excess, \nthen irresponsibly drive his car when he was under alcohol\u2019s influence. Having weighed \nthe evidence from a commonsense point of view, Applicant has not overcome the security \nconcerns arising from the guideline for alcohol consumption and his criminal conduct. \n6 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n \n                      \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:   \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:           \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:          \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Accordingly, this case is decided against \nApplicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non November 6, 2019. (Exhibit 3) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. He provided additional information when interviewed in February \n2020 during a background investigation. (Exhibit 8) Thereafter, on December 2, 2020, \nafter reviewing the application and the information gathered during a background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort \nMeade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was \nunable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information.

He requested a decision based on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. \nOn January 31, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation, some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits herein. The FORM \nwas mailed to Applicant, who received it on February 12, 2021. He replied on March 25, \n2021.

He works full-time as a \nsupport analyst. He has been so employed since October 2019. He has held a security \nclearance since 2007. (Exhibit 3 at Section 25) He is married and has two minor \nchildren. His first marriage was relatively brief and ended in divorce.

The \nvarious accounts are described as collection or charged-off accounts along with a single \npast-due account for $1,935 on a balance of $15,675. In addition to his admissions, the \ndelinquent accounts are established by Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. \nApplicant did not disclose or otherwise reveal any specific delinquent financial \naccounts when he completed his security clearance application. (Exhibit 3 at Section \n26) But he did indicate that he was seeking assistance to resolve financial difficulties \nthat he had after leaving the Coast Guard in 2015. He elaborated on the underlying \ncause of his financial difficulties in both his answer to the SOR and his reply to the \nFORM. He explained that the cause was his transition to civilian life in 2015 and a \nsubstantial decline in income compared with the pay and benefits he received while \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nserving in the Coast Guard.1  Although he was earning less, he continued to maintain a \nsimilar lifestyle, which he could not afford and financed through loans and credit cards. \nHe sought assistance for his financial difficulties in mid-2018. He obtained a better \npaying job in 2019 (his current employment), and was able to resume repayment of \ndelinquent debts. \nApplicant accepts accountability for his financial difficulties, and he claims he \nretained the services of a debt-consolidation firm in July 2018 to assist him. The \nsupporting documentation with his Answer includes the paperwork from this firm. The \npaperwork described the firm as a \u201cdocument-preparation company.\u201d The agreement \nsigned by Applicant and his spouse provides the company will provide services to assist \nin the removal of inaccurate items from credit reports. The consumer-services section of \nthe agreement does not mention the term debt consolidation. \nBy entering into the agreement, Applicant agreed to pay an initial fee of $1,200 \nand then pay a fee of $1,118.43 for 23 monthly payments, in exchange for the services \nprovided, for a total of nearly $27,000. Furthermore, in the client-acknowledgments \nsection of the agreement, it is made clear that the company is not in the debt-\nconsolidation business. Applicant acknowledged, among other things, the following: (1) \nhe could perform any of the services explained in the agreement without entering into \nthe agreement; (2) the company does not settle or reduce his debt but rather assists \nhim in determining if his creditors are reporting accurate information to credit reporting \nagencies; (3) the company is not a debt-consolidation or debt-settlement company; and \n(4) the company does not pay off his alleged creditors with the funds he pays, rather \nthose funds go directly to pay the company for their services it provides to him. I find \nthat Applicant did not enter into a debt-consolidation plan with the company but rather \nhired the company to provide services in the nature of credit repair.     \nApplicant has made some progress in resolving the delinquent debts in the SOR. \nAs discussed in more detail below, he has resolved three of the eight delinquent debts. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a concerns a $30,178 collection account for a personal \nloan. He entered into a settlement agreement with the creditor in December 2020, and \nhe agreed to pay the sum of $16,200 by making 36 monthly payments of $450 \nbeginning November 2020 through October 2023. (Exhibit A) He provided a copy of the \nfinal consent order (a document filed in state court) used to settle the debt, but he did \nnot provide proof of payment per the terms of the settlement. I find this debt is \nunresolved. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b concerns a charged-off credit card account for $18,472. In \nhis reply to the FORM, Applicant asserted the debt was negotiated by the debt-\n1 Applicant stated in his reply to the FORM that he was unemployed for nearly a year after his discharge \nfrom the Coast Guard, but his security clearance application discloses no periods of unemployment. \n(Exhibit 3 at Section 13A) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \nconsolidation firm and the account has been closed. He also provided a letter from the \ncredit union showing the account was charged off.2  I find this debt is unresolved.  \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c concerns a $16,585 collection account for a credit card \naccount. In his reply to the FORM, Applicant asserted the debt was negotiated by the \ndebt-consolidation firm and the account has been closed with nothing owed. He did not \nprovide supporting documentation for his assertion. The most recent credit report from \nOctober 2020 shows the account had a past-due balance of $16,585, which was \ncharged off by the creditor. (Exhibit 9 at 3) I find this debt is unresolved. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d concerns an $11,948 charged-off account. Both \ncorrespondence from the creditor and the October 2020 credit report show the account \nhas been closed with a balance of $0. (Exhibit A; Exhibit 9 at 2) I find this debt is \nresolved. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e concerns a past-due account in the amount of $1,935 for \na personal loan obtained from a peer-to-peer lending company. In his reply to the \nFORM, Applicant asserted the debt was not delinquent and was being repaid as \nagreed. He did not provide supporting documentation for his assertion. The October \n2020 credit report shows the account with a past-due balance of $1,935, a monthly \ninstallment payment of $644, and a balance of $15,675. (Exhibit 9 at 4) I find this debt is \nnot resolved. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f concerns a $4,874 charged-off credit card account. In his \nreply to the FORM, Applicant asserted the debt was negotiated by the debt-\nconsolidation firm and the account has been closed with nothing owed. He did not \nprovide supporting documentation for his assertion. The October 2020 credit report \nshows the account as an unpaid collection account with a balance of $4,874. (Exhibit 9 \nat 1) I find this debt is not resolved. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g concerns a $1,291 collection account for \ntelecommunication services. Applicant settled this account for the lesser amount of \n$655 in January 2021. (Exhibit A) I find this debt is resolved. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h concerns a $1,087 medical collection account. The \naccount now has a balance of $0. (Exhibit A) I find this debt is resolved. \n2  Applicant does not understand the meaning and effect of a charged-off account. A charge off means the \ncreditor has decided to treat an account receivable as a loss or expense because payment is unlikely. \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 266 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th  ed., West 2009). In other words, the lender or \ncreditor has written the account off as a loss (e.g., a bad debt), and the account is closed to future \ncharges. The account may be sold to a debt buyer or transferred to a collection agency. And the debtor is \nstill legally obligated to pay the debt provided the time limit in the relevant statute of limitations has not run \nor lapsed.    \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.3  As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d4  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.5  The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.6   \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.7  Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.8  \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n3  Department of the Navy v.

It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or \nirresponsible \nspending, \nwhich \nmay \nbe \nindicated \nby \nexcessive \nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of late payments or \nnon-payment, or other negative financial indicators.  \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here. After his discharge from the Coast \nGuard, Applicant engaged in a pattern of irresponsible spending beyond his means \nwhen he elected to assume excessive indebtedness to pay for a lifestyle that he could \nnot afford on his earned income. \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated his history of \nfinancial problems, which are unresolved and ongoing. I have reviewed all of the \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and conclude none are fully applicable. \nApplicant has made some progress by resolving three of the eight delinquent debts in \nthe SOR; however, the remaining five delinquent debts are wholly unresolved, the debts \ntotal tens of thousands of dollars, and he has no plan in place to resolve them. \nFurther complicating his financial situation, Applicant engaged the services of a \nfirm that provides credit-repair services believing it was in the debt-consolidation \nbusiness. In doing so, he agreed to make installment payments to the firm over two \nyears for nearly $27,000, which would have gone a long way toward paying or settling \nthe five unresolved delinquent accounts. He did not provide any documentation to show \nthat he is in good standing with the installment agreement, which was scheduled to \nconclude with a final installment payment in June 2020. Like his irresponsible spending, \nhis decision to hire the credit-repair firm believing it was a debt-consolidation firm \nindicates a lack of financial awareness or sophistication that militates against a \nfavorable clearance decision. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 24, 2020, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) \nDirective 5220.6, as amended (Directive), DoD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available \nto the government, DoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge.

The record \nclosed on September 10, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 55, is married and has a child from a previous relationship and a \nstepson with his wife. (Tr. 18) He obtained his high school diploma in June 1984. He \ncompleted his undergraduate degree in 2003. (Tr. 22) He has taken courses for his \nmaster\u2019s degree, but not since 2007. (Tr. 53) Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force (active \nduty) for ten years from June 1990 until April 2000, and received an honorable discharge. \nHe also served in the Air Force Reserves from April 2000 until 2007. Applicant completed \nhis security clearance application on October 24, 2018. He has held a security clearance \nsince 1997. (GE 1) Applicant has worked for his current employer for about one month as \na systems engineer. (Tr. 21) Before moving from state A where he earned about \n$132,000, to state B, he was able to support himself and his daughter. (Tr. 27, AE B) \nThe SOR (1.a-k) alleges that Applicant has delinquent debt in the approximate \namount of $25,637. The debts include consumer loans and collection accounts. Applicant \nadmitted the majority of the allegations. He denied two allegations (1.a and 1.k) because \nhe believed the accounts were resolved or are in dispute. Applicant noted that he used \npoor judgment. He wishes that he had contacted his creditors earlier. (Tr. 33) \nApplicant acknowledged his financial hardship over the past years due to a move \nfrom one state to another for a 2017 job offer that did not materialize; other unemployment \nfrom July 2017 to January 2018, and unemployment from November 2020 to June of \n2021. (Tr. 56) He identified single parenthood; custody battles and his wife\u2019s legal fees; \nunderemployment for an hourly wage and child support as contributing factors for his \nfinancial problems. (Tr. 32, 34, AE D) He acknowledged that he had not started payments \non the SOR debts because he borrowed money from friends and family, and wanted to \npay them first. (GE 2) He borrowed about $10,000 from a number of close friends and \nfamily and has repaid some of the loans. (Tr. 32, 87, Answer to SOR; and AE G) He \nbelieved he was making the right decision by paying his friends and family before he paid \nthe debts on the SOR. (Tr. 24) Applicant also paid child support and money for arrears. \n(Tr. 42) He is current with his child support payments. (Tr. 49) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s investigative interview from January to May 2019, he stated \nthat unemployment benefits that he received were his means of financial support. (GE 2) \nNow that he has a full-time position making about $140,000, he has arranged payment \nplans and wants to repay all debts within a two-year period. (Tr. 21) However, he has only \nhad this position for a little over a month. Before the current position, he accepted a \nposition in January 2018 that earned him $22.74 an hour. From September 2018 until \nNovember 2020, he earned $119,000. (Tr. 34, 56) He submitted a pay slip from an \nemployment commission from July 2019 to June 30, 2020. Applicant received COVID \nstimulus checks for $358 a week.

He cleaned the apartment in 2017, and the rental \ncompany refused to do a walk through. He did not file a written dispute with one of the \ncredit reporting companies, as this rental company had a history of charging a departure \nfee based on the condition of the unit. At the hearing, Applicant stated that he settled the \naccount for $307, approximately half the amount billed by the creditor. (Tr. 60) He \nprovided documentation, which was dated June 2021. (AE F) The disputes were all in the \nnature of verbal conversations. (Tr. 64) \nAs to SOR 1.b, Applicant admitted that he owed the charged-off account for a \ncredit card in the amount of $1,648. The last activity on the account was in 2017. (Tr. 65) \nApplicant entered into a payment arrangement in May 2020. (AE F) He claimed that he \nhas made payments for three months, but provided no receipts. He put $100 down, and \nwill make monthly payments of $25. (AE G) He hopes to increase the monthly amounts. \nHe submitted a post-hearing submission that showed the balance on the account is now \n$1,548. (Tr. 67) \nAs to SOR 1.c, a charged-off account in the amount of $7,303, for a consolidation \nloan, Applicant admits the account is in default due to unemployment and personal loan \nrepayments. He was due a federal tax refund, but $7,303 was taken by the IRS to pay \nthis account. (Tr. 47, 69; AE E) He submitted a cancellation of debt \u2013 Form 1099-C, dated \nDecember 15, 2020, to show that the debt has been discharged from part of his IRS \nrefund. \nAs to SOR 1.d, a collection account in the amount of $1,243, Applicant admits that\nhe owes the debt and the account is in default due to unemployment. The first delinquency\noccurred in 2017. Applicant entered into a payment agreement in 2021. (AE F) He\nsubmitted a post-hearing submission (AE G) that showed the balance, as of June 5, 2021\nwas $1,217.63. The plan arrangement will end in June 2025, if Applicant pays $25 a\nmonth.  \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.e, a collection account in the amount of $5,776, Applicant admitted \nthat he owes this amount and it is in default due to unemployment. He set up a payment \nplan in May 2021. (Tr. 75) He submitted, after the hearing, a copy of the same plan \narrangement that he produced at the hearing and the document showed the plan called \nfor an electronic payment of $125 starting in June 2021. The balance on the document \nwas $5,651.35. (AE G) The plan would end in March 2025. There is nothing else to \nsupport Applicant\u2019s claim that he has made any more payments.  \nAs to SOR 1.f, a collection credit account in the amount of $1,341.00. Applicant \nmade a payment agreement on May 13, 2021. He submitted a document after the hearing \nthat showed a balance of $1,316, with the attached payment plan. He is required to make \nmonthly payments of $25. The plan ends in 2025. (AE G) Another document was attached \nthat was dated June 2021, which had a balance of $1,291.

Applicant admitted \nthe debt. In May 2021, he made a payment agreement. He made a payment of $25 but \nhas not done anything else to resolve the debt since the agreement. (Tr. 77, AE G) \nAs to SOR 1.h, a collection account in the amount of $2,175, Applicant admitted \nthe debt which was a credit card. The account became delinquent in 2017 and in May \n2021, Applicant entered into a payment arrangement to pay $25 a month. He submitted \na document after the hearing that showed a balance of $2,125. (AE G, Tr.78) \nAs to SOR 1.i, a collection account in the amount of $2,282, Applicant admitted he \ndefaulted on the account in 2017, and until he made a payment arrangement in 2021, he \ndid not take any action to resolve the debt. (Tr. 79, AE F) He submitted a document that \nshows a balance of $2,256 as of May 26, 2021. (AE G) \nAs to SOR 1.j, a collection account in the amount of $1,036, Applicant admitted \nhe defaulted but did not know that the account was now $3,000. In 2021, he arranged a \npayment arrangement to pay $100 each month until the balance is paid in full. Applicant \nprovided evidence that he made one payment of $100. (AE F) His plan is set to end in \n2024. \nAs to SOR 1.k, a collection account in the amount of $1,178, Applicant denied that \nhe owed this account. He stated that the account was paid and that he owed at the time \n$800. He believes it was paid in 2018 or 2019 and deducted from his bank account. (Tr. \n81) He did not provide any documentation to confirm his assertion except that it is not on \nhis credit report. (Tr. 81) \nApplicant submitted a letter of reference from someone who has known him for 18 \nyears. This reference attests to the fact that Applicant is a devoted friend and a great \nmember of the community. He has a positive attitude, good character and integrity. \nApplicant sets a standard for excellence. (Letter in file) \nApplicant has not sought financial counseling, nor did he present a budget. He \nstated that his wife also works. He has no car loan. He has little money in a savings or \nchecking account. \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were basically the payment plans that he \nhas entered into for the various accounts. They are duplicates of what he presented at \nthe hearing. Some documents showed a lesser amount owed than was alleged in the \nSOR, however, there were no electronic copies of the debits that he actually made as a \npayment. It is not possible to know how many payments, if any were made to the various \ncreditors. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are long-standing and he acknowledges that he used poor \njudgment and did not address the delinquent accounts until recently. He borrowed money \nfrom friends and family, and decided to repay them before the delinquent debts. After the \nissuance of the SOR, Applicant began to contact some of the creditors and or dispute the \naccounts.

He promises to address the accounts and to continue to pay \nthem in the future. He has set up payment plans and settled one account. One account \nwas cancelled because the IRS took part of his tax refund to pay the creditor. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant presented credible explanations for \nthe delinquent debts and that circumstances beyond his control caused the delinquent \ndebts, but he did not act responsibly to address the resulting debts by borrowing $10,000 \nfrom his friends and paying them before the creditors. It is clear that the unemployment \nperiods, custody battle, and loss of an expected job in 2017 are evidence of some \nmitigation, but he did not address any payment plans until 2021. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not receive any financial \ncounseling; nor are there clear indications that his financial situation is under control. Only \nrecently did he begin to address the debts when he realized that his security clearance \nand employment were in jeopardy. He did not present sufficient evidence to meet his \nburden of proof. He does not have a sufficient or meaningful track record to address his \ngood judgment and reliability. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k against Applicant, except for SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including his service in the military, his unemployment and openness \nat the hearing, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nby his financial indebtedness. Applicant failed to submit evidence that any payments or \ncontinuous payments have been made that demonstrate an established history of good \nfaith payments on the delinquent debts. His judgment is questioned when he decided to \nrepay money borrowed from friends instead of addressing his creditors. Accordingly, \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a judgment, charged-off \nauto loans, a past-due second mortgage loan, and other delinquent debts. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to unemployment in 2013 and \nsubsequent periods of underemployment and low-paying jobs. Those events qualify as \nconditions that were largely beyond his control. \nThe $4,088 judgment to a collection unit for a state was satisfied in November \n2020. SOR \u00b6 1.a is mitigated and concluded for Applicant. He brought his primary \nmortgage loan current and reduced the amount that was past due on his second \nmortgage loan from $5,213 to $4,618. That is sufficient effort to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.h. \nThere is no evidence of payments toward the remaining SOR debts. As a \ncosigner of the $12,485 charged-off auto loan, he is liable for the debt, even if he \nexpected the other cosigner to pay it. He stated that he is working to obtain IT \ncertifications that will enable him to earn a higher salary and pay his debts. However, \nintentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant does not have a sufficient track record to enable me to trust that he will \npay his debts. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that his financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant may reach a point \nwhere his finances are sufficiently in order to warrant a security clearance, but he has \nnot established that he is there at this time. I find that financial considerations security \nconcerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 18, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 14, 2021. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on August 4, 2021, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on August 25, 2021. The Government offered six exhibits, referred to as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection.

He has a high school \ndiploma and a little over a year of college. He holds the position of Senior Logistician \nfor a defense contractor. He seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment in the defense industry. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 3 delinquent student loan accounts totaling \napproximately $69,354. In his Answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations and \nprovides explanations. Credit reports of the Applicant dated May 28, 2020; and June \n23, 2021, reflect that each of these debts was at one point owing. \n(Government \nExhibits 5 and 6.) \nApplicant began working in the defense industry in 2007. It was at that time that \nhe was granted a security clearance. He started working for his current employer in \n2013. He has never had any security violations of any sort. Except for his delinquent \nstudent loans Applicant has maintained good credit. He always paid his bills on time \nand lived within his means. \nIn about 2007, Applicant\u2019s older brother who was attending college asked the \nApplicant to co-sign for him on a student loan. Applicant was employed with a previous \nemployer at the time and agreed to do it. Sometime later, Applicant learned that his \nbrother defaulted on the loan. \n2 \n \nIn 2010, the creditor contacted the Applicant in an effort to collect payment of the \ndebt.  Applicant did not fully understand why they were calling him for payment and \nignored the creditor.  Applicant spoke to his brother about it, and his brother assured the \nApplicant that he was handling the situation.  As time passed, Applicant thought that his \nbrother was paying the loan debt.  At some point Applicant learned that his brother had \nnot paid the student loan debt and had no intention of paying the student loan debt.  \nApplicant was angry with his brother, and for some time refused to speak to his brother. \nAs time passed, Applicant eventually decided to resolve the matter himself, as he did \nnot want the loan hanging over his head.  Applicant looked into the matter to find out \nhow much he owed and who he needed to pay.  At that time, Applicant learned that he \nhad not only co-signed for his brother for one loan, but unbeknownst to him he had co-\nsigned a Master Release Form that allowed his brother to use Applicant\u2019s name as a \nco-signer on all of his student loans.   Applicant stated that he decided to take action to \nresolve the debts.  Applicant contacted the creditor to determine his available options.  \nApplicant was told about the Co-signer Relief Plan, which allowed him to settle the debt \nfor less than what was owed.  This required the Applicant to make two lump sum \npayments of $6,457, to close out all three accounts for a total of almost $13,000.  \nApplicant stated that he paid the creditor and resolved the three student loan accounts \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n        \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe had co-signed for.

(Tr. pp. 31- 32.) \nAllegation 1.a., is a delinquent student loan debt that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $28,126. Applicant settled this debt under the Co-signer Relief \nPlan (discussed above) and it is deemed paid in full. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nAllegation 1.b., is a delinquent student loan debt that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $27,807. Applicant settled this debt under the Co-signer Relief \nPlan (discussed above) and it is deemed paid in full. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \nAllegation 1.c., is a delinquent student loan debt that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $13,421. Applicant settled this debt under the Co-signer Relief \nPlan (discussed above) and it is deemed paid in full. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant co-signed for his older brother\u2019s student loan. He was not aware of \nwhat he his obligations were under the contract. \nApplicant ended up signing a \ndocument that allowed his brother to use him as a co-signer on all of his student loans. \nWhen Applicant\u2019s brother defaulted on his student loans, Applicant became responsible \nto pay them. Applicant became excessively indebted in the amount of $69,354. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nUpon learning that his brother had defaulted on the student loan, and that \nApplicant would be responsible under the loan to pay the debt, Applicant took the \nnecessary action to resolve it. This was a tough lesson. Although this was not easy to \ndo, Applicant settled his brother\u2019s student loan debt paying out of pocket almost \n$13,000 to get the debt resolved. Applicant acted in a reasonable and responsible \nmanner. Applicant has shown good judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. There are \nclear indications that his financial indebtedness is resolved and under control. He has \nalso demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) \nprovide full mitigation. The Financial Considerations concern has been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a \nmature, responsible, hardworking defense industry employee who shows great potential \nand who is well respected by those he works with. He clearly understands the great \nresponsibilities he has in holding a security clearance. He has shown the requisite good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of this privilege. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Tr. at 56, 66, 82-84, 88-89; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant reported his marijuana use on the Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) he submitted in April 2020. He noted that he intended to continue to \n\u201cuse edibles, rubs or vapes as necessary to assist with insomnia and pain \nmanagement.\u201d (GE 1) \nApplicant fully discussed his marijuana use when he was interviewed for his \nbackground investigation in May 2020. He indicated that he was aware that marijuana \nuse was illegal under federal law, but he followed the state\u2019s approach. When he \nresponded to DOHA interrogatories in October 2020, he indicated that he planned to \ncontinue using marijuana for medicinal purposes for his insomnia and pain \nmanagement. (GE 2) \nApplicant did not understand the full ramifications of his marijuana use until he \nreceived the SOR and discussed it with his attorney. He was previously incorrectly \nadvised that as long as he was completely honest, that his marijuana use would not \npreclude him from holding a security clearance. The last time he purchased marijuana \nwas in December 2020, and the last time he used marijuana was in January 2021. He \nnow completely realizes that marijuana use is against the law, not responsible conduct, \nand inconsistent with holding a security clearance.

He is praised for his professionalism, technical \nexpertise, reliability, trustworthiness, leadership, work ethic, dependability, and honesty. \n(Tr. at 14-28; AE E-H) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nHe indicated that he intended to continue to use marijuana. He no longer holds that \nposition. AG \u00b6 25(g) was applicable at one time. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nMarijuana remains a controlled substance and illegal under federal law. It is \nsometimes difficult for those of us who are part of DOD, and particularly those in the \nlegal community, to truly understand how prevalent and accepted marijuana use has \nbecome. Well-known celebrities and sports figures advocate its use and have become \ncannabis entrepreneurs. Colleges provide courses in cannabis entrepreneurship, and \none college offers a bachelor\u2019s degree in that discipline.1 Major business publications \nprovide articles on getting started in the industry.2 The National Institutes of Health \nstates that cannabis may be helpful in treating certain conditions and ailments.3 States \nhave not only decriminalized marijuana, they have become active participants in its use, \nas indicated by the creation of state agencies. I do not cite these facts because I \n1 See, e.g., Growth Potential | Johnson & Wales University (jwu.edu) \n2 See, e.g., Advice For Young Cannabis Entrepreneurs Looking To Get Started (forbes.com).  \n3 Cannabis (Marijuana) and Cannabinoids: What You Need To Know | NCCIH (nih.gov).  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncondone marijuana use; I do not. I cite them to provide context to the world Applicant \nlived in when he made the decision to use marijuana for medicinal purposes, and why it \ntook so long for him to stop. \nApplicant now completely realizes that marijuana use is against federal law, not \nresponsible conduct, and inconsistent with holding a security clearance. He credibly \ntestified that he will not use illegal drugs in the future. He fully disclosed his drug use on \nhis SF 86 and throughout the security clearance proceedings. He signed a statement of \nintent to abstain from all illegal drug use with the acknowledgment that any future \ninvolvement with illegal drugs would be grounds for revocation of his security clearance. \nI found him to be forthcoming and credible. There are no bright-line rules for how long \nan applicant must go without problematic conduct. Under the facts of this case, I find \nthat Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and that \nillegal drug use is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s conduct no longer casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 44 years old and works for a defense contractor as a security guard. He was born in a foreign country in the Caribbean and entered the United States at age 12 with his family. In 2009 he naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He was granted a security clearance the same year. He earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. He began working part time \u201con call\u201d for his current employer in 2019 at a higher hourly pay rate than he has earned in the past. With a security clearance, he would be able to work full time and earn much more with overtime, which is readily available at his employer. He also works less than full time as an armed security guard for another employer. He has been continuously employed in the security field since 2008. Some of his jobs, however, have been part time or paid poorly. He has never married. He has one child, age 14. (Tr. at 20-22, 25-27; GE 2 at 4.)

He admitted \neach of the allegations, noting for each of them, \u201cI will [be] taking care of [the debt].\u201d He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). On April 13, 2021, the case was assigned to me. On the same day, \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for June 9, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented five \nproposed exhibits, which he marked for identification purposes as Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 5. All of the Government\u2019s exhibits were admitted without objection. \nApplicant offered no exhibits at the hearing. (Hearing Transcript at 8-17.) \nI kept the record open until July 7, 2021, to give Applicant the opportunity to \nsupplement the record. On June 28, 2021, Applicant sent via email 11 documents, which \nare marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through K and admitted without objection. He \nsubmitted no additional exhibits before the record closed. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on June 16, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old and works for a defense contractor as a security guard. \nHe was born in a foreign country in the Caribbean and entered the United States at age \n12 with his family. In 2009 he naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He was granted a security \nclearance the same year. He earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. He began working part \ntime \u201con call\u201d for his current employer in 2019 at a higher hourly pay rate than he has \nearned in the past. With a security clearance, he would be able to work full time and earn \nmuch more with overtime, which is readily available at his employer. He also works less \nthan full time as an armed security guard for another employer. He has been continuously \nemployed in the security field since 2008. Some of his jobs, however, have been part time \nor paid poorly. He has never married. He has one child, age 14. (Tr. at 20-22, 25-27; GE \n2 at 4.) \nIn his May 28, 2019 background interview, Applicant was confronted with a large \nnumber of debts that were delinquent or in collection. He acknowledged the debts and \ntold the investigator that it was his intention to pay them. (GE 2 at 4-11.) \nSOR Allegations \nParagraph 1, Guideline F - The SOR sets forth 18 allegations regarding Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts, ten of which are student loans.

Collection account $969. This debt is for rental charges for a storage unit. \nApplicant moved to a rental consisting of a single room and had to put his property into \nstorage. He had other debts and stopped making payments to this creditor in 2019. He \nentered into a $100 per month payment arrangement with the collection agency handling \nthis debt. He made his first payment in May 2021. After the hearing, he provided evidence \nof a June 2021 payment in the amount of $50. This debt will be fully repaid in about eight \nmonths. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 41-45; GE 5 at 1; AE J.) \nb. Collection account - $386. This credit-card debt is owed to a bank. Applicant \ntestified that he has paid the debt. He provided documentary evidence of his payment in \nfull. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 45-48; GE 3 at 14; GE 4 at 2; AE F.) \nc. Charged-off account - $593. Applicant opened this credit-card account in \nJanuary 2018 and defaulted in mid-2019. He is presently making payments on the \naccount. He provided a document evidencing $50 payments every month since February \n2021, totaling $293, about one-half of the debt. The Government\u2019s March 2021 credit \nreport in the record (GE 5) reflects that Applicant had reduced the amount of the debt at \nthat time by $100. He also provided a statement from the creditor reflecting a remaining \nbalance of about $300. This debt will be fully repaid in about six months after the close of \nthe record. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 48-49; GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 3; \nAE E.) \nd. Charged-off account - $213. Applicant opened this jewelry store charge \naccount in 2017 and defaulted on the account in 2018. After the hearing, he entered into \na payment plan to repay this debt with six monthly installments of $35, totaling $213. He \nalso provided evidence that he made his first payment on June 16, 2021. This debt will \nbe fully repaid in about five months after the close of the record. This debt is being \nresolved. (Tr. at 49-50; GE 3 at 7 15; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 3; AE G.) \ne. Charged-off account - $3,315. Applicant opened this auto-loan account in \n2017. He defaulted on the loan in 2020. Applicant testified that he is now \u201cfocused\u201d on \nrepaying this debt because, aside from his student loans, it is one of his largest debts. \nAfter the hearing, he made his first payment of $276.91, plus a service fee. This amount \nrepresents the first of 12 monthly payments. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 50; GE \n3 at 9; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4; AE C.) \nf.

About a year after he \ngraduated with his Bachelor\u2019s degree, Applicant began repaying his student loans. He \nwas making automatic monthly payments of $150 out of his bank account. He changed \naccounts and failed to notify the lender, so the payments stopped. The eight loans listed \nin the SOR allegations noted above have been assigned to the U.S. Department of \nEducation (DOE) for collection.

I note that due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, the \nDOE has been providing temporary relief of student loans, including the suspension of \nloan payments and collections of defaulted loans. On January 20, 2021, President Biden \nextended that COVID-19 emergency relief to September 30, 2021, and on August 6, \n2021, the pause was extended to January 31, 2022. As a result, Applicant is not obligated \nto make any payments until the new deadline. If he receives a security clearance and \nbecomes eligible to work full time with his sponsor, he will have more funds available to \npay his student loans debts at that time. These debts are not yet resolved, but no \npayments are due at this time and he has a plan to begin addressing these debts when \nrequired to do so. I conclude this debt in favor of Applicant.

He was unaware that he would have a large deficiency on the debt after the \nrepossession. He testified that he will resolve this debt through a payment plan once he \nis able to work full-time with his clearance sponsor with a security clearance. After the \nhearing, he provided evidence of a payment plan to pay $413.15 per month and an initial \npayment of $150. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 51-52; GE 3 at 3; AE D.) \nq.

(Tr. at 53; GE 3 at 15; AE K.) \nApplicant pays $40 per week in child support. The amount is deducted from his \npaycheck every week. He has no arrearage for unpaid child support. In the past, he has \nbeen focused on paying his rent, child support, and utilities. He testified that he does not \nearn a lot of money, and he pays the bills he can to meet his basic commitments. Now \nthat he has some additional income from a second part-time job, he is focused on \nrepaying his largest debts, which are his student loans and his unpaid auto loans. With a \nsecurity clearance, he can work full time with his sponsor and be eligible to work overtime. \nHe is presently working \u201con call\u201d with that employer.

It\u2019s just so much.  \nHe works about 32 hours per week at his primary job as an armed security guard and is \nworking one or two days a week \u201con call\u201d at his clearance sponsor. He earns less than \n$3,000 per month and lives in a state known for its high cost of living. He is careful with \nhis spending, but he does not have a written budget. He has not received any credit \ncounseling. In the past, he has had financial problems when his hours were reduced or \nhis pay rate was insufficient, not because of any extended unemployment. (Tr. at 55-59.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe Government\u2019s credit reports listing 18 delinquent debts establish the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19 that could be disqualifying: \n(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Four of these mitigating conditions have \npossible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous and in some \ninstances, they are recent. His debts arose due to his underemployment and near \npoverty-level income while living in a state with a high cost of living, not due to any unusual \noccurrence in his life. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant has not been successful in realizing his full \nincome potential following his graduation with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. He has \nworked in a field that does not pay him enough money to support himself and his child \ncomfortably. Had he not been underemployed as a college graduate, he could have \ncontinued paying his student loans. Notwithstanding his chronic problem of working in a \nlow-income field, his total delinquent consumer debt is relatively small, less than $7,000, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexcluding an auto loan that ended badly with a repossession and a $16,000 deficiency. \nThis evidences that he has acted responsibly in controlling his spending and paying most \nof his bills. Applicant is highly motivated to resolve his debts. At every opportunity since \nhis receipt of the SOR, Applicant has stated his commitment to repay all of his debts. He \nis making progress on his debts in a responsible manner consistent with his very limited \nresources. Two of his consumer debts have been repaid and he has put in place payment \nplans to repay the six remaining consumer debts over the next five to 40 months. He has \nalso arranged rehabilitation plans for his student loans and will begin paying his loans \nwhen required to do so. Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances and \nconsistent with his limited financial resources. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant has not received any financial \ncounseling. All of the progress he has made in repaying debts and setting up payment \nplans and rehabilitation agreements is the result of his own efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. Although it is too early to conclude that all of Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are being resolved or are under control, he has shown impressive initiative to \nresolve his debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant is making progress towards regaining \nfinancial responsibility in a deliberate and measured way. He has repaid two debts (1.b \nand 1.r). He has also made payment arrangements to repay his six other consumer debts \n(1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.p, and 1.q) with time frames of five months (1.d), six months (1.c), \neight months (1.a), 12 months (1.e), 16 months (1.q), and 40 months (1.p). As each debt \nis paid off, he has more funds available to pay his student loans and improve the quality \nof his rather modest lifestyle. Applicant initiated the payment plans on two of his debts \nprior to the hearing, specifically 1.a in May 2021 and 1.c in February 2021. He also \ninitiated his plan to rehabilitate eight of his student loans prior to the hearing, though the \npayments are not scheduled to start until October 2021, when the payment moratorium \nwas previously scheduled to expire. His other repayment plans arose after the hearing. \nThis timing undercuts the good- faith nature of his mitigation efforts under this mitigating \ncondition. He has long recognized that he needed more income to be in a position to \nbegin repaying his debts and to avoid some of more recent delinquencies. Now that he is \nworking two jobs, he has more financial resources available to begin to resolve his debts. \nThe adjudicative guidelines do not require that an applicant be free of unpaid \ndebts. The Appeal Board has established the following basic guidance for adjudications \nin cases such as this: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which the applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations omitted). \nSince the hearing, Applicant has taken aggressive steps to address all of his unpaid \nconsumer debts starting immediately, not just one at a time. In several instances, his track \nrecord of adherence to his repayment agreements has been short, but in the case of two \nof his debts, he began making payments prior to the hearing, evidencing his commitment \nand desire to repay his debts in a timely manner. Also, he contacted the DOE\u2019s collection \nagent and made a plan to begin to rehabilitate most of his student loans when the \nrepayment moratorium was scheduled to terminate in October 2021. After the hearing, \nhe followed up with a second DOE collection agent to enter into a rehabilitation agreement \nfor his two other student loans. \nWhen considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view Applicant\u2019s \ncorrective action to be responsible and reasonable. Given his limited financial resources, \nhe has initiated a pragmatic approach to the repayment of his SOR debts and is making \na sincere, proactive effort to resolve those debts. He has made considerable sacrifices to \nget to the point where he is today. Overall, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated security \nconcerns raised by financial considerations. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \ndetermination to obtain a college degree and his success in achieving that goal, even \nthough it required him to take on a large amount of student-loan debt to pay for his \neducation. For whatever reason, his dream that a college degree would translate into \nimproved income has eluded him to date. He is still working in the same type of jobs that \nhe had before he began his college education. As a result, he has not been able to repay \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis student loans pursuant to their terms. But he has not given up, and he is diligently \nworking to resolve these student loan debts and his other delinquent debts. His \ndetermination in spite of years of adversity is impressive. His commitment to improve his \nlife and his financial security is sincere. This makes his stated intent to resolve all of his \ndebts credible. As he wrote in his Answer, \u201cI will be taking care of these debts.\u201d He has \nnot tried to evade or dispute his debts. He impressed me at the hearing as a person who \nwill honor his word as a matter of pride and sense of obligation. \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant is 36 years old and has worked for a major defense contractor as a cyber security engineer since September 2018. After graduating from high school, Applicant studied for one year (July 2003-June 2004) at the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School, which is also known as West Point Prep. This education constituted active-duty service in the Army. He did not continue his education at West Point and was honorably discharged from the Army. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in August 2007 and began working for a major defense contractor (E1) in November 2007 as an information assurance engineer. He also continued his studies and earned two master\u2019s degrees, one in December 2013 and a second in April 2015, and a Ph.D. in March 2021.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old and has worked for a major defense contractor as a cyber \nsecurity engineer since September 2018. After graduating from high school, Applicant \nstudied for one year (July 2003-June 2004) at the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory \nSchool, which is also known as West Point Prep. This education constituted active-duty \nservice in the Army. He did not continue his education at West Point and was honorably \ndischarged from the Army. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in August 2007 and began \nworking for a major defense contractor (E1) in November 2007 as an information \nassurance engineer. He also continued his studies and earned two master\u2019s degrees, \none in December 2013 and a second in April 2015, and a Ph.D. in March 2021. He was \nfirst granted a security clearance in about November 2007 and has continuously \nmaintained his eligibility. He has lived with his girlfriend since 2017. They have no \nchildren. (Tr. at 20-21; GE 2 at 14; AE C.) \nApplicant\u2019s last day of work at E1 was August 30, 2018. He had previously given \nnotice of his intent to resign his position at that company and had accepted a position with \nhis current employer (E2). In the afternoon of his last day of work, he downloaded over \n15,000 files onto his personal USB external hard drive (USB Device), and when he left \nthe employer\u2019s premises, he took the USB Device with him. On September 4, 2018, \ninvestigators at E1 were alerted to this unusual downloading activity by a departing \nemployee and investigated the circumstances. (GE 3 at 1.) \nThe investigators found that the file path for the downloaded files was titled \n\u201cPersonaldocs\\[E1].\u201d They issued a memorandum to Applicant (the E1 Memorandum), \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndated September 6, 2018, even though he no longer worked there. Applicant signed the \nE1 Memorandum the next day, acknowledging receipt, and returned it to the investigators. \nIn the E1 Memorandum, the investigators advised Applicant that he had violated two \ncompany policies set forth in the E1 Corporate Information Protection Manual by \nconnecting his USB Device to E1\u2019s information network and by downloading files from \nE1\u2019s network onto his personal USB Device without authorization. The two policies are \ndescribed in the E1 Memorandum as follows: \n1. Section 106.6.7(1)  - titled Storage of Information on Personally Owned \nInformation Technology Assets; and \n2. Section 106.6.7(3) -  titled Connectivity of Personally Owned Information \nTechnology Assets to [E1] Infrastructure. \nThe investigators instructed Applicant to return his USB Device to E1, which he did. They \nadvised him and sought his acknowledgment that E1 may delete E1 information from the \ndevice and in the process may also delete Applicant\u2019s information. In a separate internal \nE1 memorandum, dated December 10, 2018, which was not shared with Applicant at that \ntime, the writer noted that the files recovered from his USB Device numbered 15,179 with \na total amount of 8.7 gigabytes of data transferred from E1\u2019s network to the USB Device. \nThe investigators compared that number of files with a full-year count of the number of \nfiles Applicant would transfer in the performance of his work duties, which was 22,599. \nThis comparison highlighted the unusual nature of Applicant\u2019s actions on the day he left \nE1. (Tr. at 39, 66-68; GE 3 at 1-2.) \nThe December 10, 2018 internal memorandum references the allegation under \ninvestigation as follows: \nAllegation: Data Exfiltration with CI/CT nexus (SUBSTANTIATED) \n(emphasis in original) \nThe term CI/CT stands for Counterintelligence/Counter Terrorism.

He was \nthen confronted by the background investigator with information from his E1 employment \nrecords regarding his actions on August 30, 2018. Applicant was advised that as a result \nof his actions on that date he was not eligible for rehire at E1. He testified at the hearing \nthat he learned for the first time during his background interview that E1 regarded his \nactions as improper. Applicant admitted to the investigator that on his last day at E1, he \naccidentally downloaded E1 proprietary information (E1PI) onto his USB Device when he \nwas hurriedly downloading his personal files onto his device that he wanted to take with \nhim.

This information was downloaded \nonto the same drive on the E1 network that he used for work-related activities. He claimed \nthat in his haste, he inadvertently downloaded E1PI along with his personal files. (Tr. at \n39-40; GE 2 at 6-7.) \nSOR Allegations \nParagraph 1, Guideline K - The SOR sets forth a single allegation under this \nguideline in which the Government alleges that Applicant deliberately downloaded E1PI \nonto his USB Device in August 2018 while employed by E1. In his Answer, Applicant \nwrote that his actions were not deliberate. He wrote that he only intended to download his \neducational materials related to his master\u2019s degree studies as well as over two years of \nhis studies in his Ph.D. program. He explained that his E1 work laptop was limited to \nunclassified information. In mitigation, he commented that he immediately complied with \nthe request of E1\u2019s security manager to deliver the USB Device to the manager. He also \nargued that his actions were infrequent and the result of inadequate training while he \nworked at E1. \nParagraph 2, Guideline M - This paragraph of the SOR cross-alleges under \nGuideline M the same facts alleged under Guideline K. In his Answer, Applicant admitted \nthe disqualifying facts, using the words \u201cI accept\u201d rather than \u201cI admit.\u201d In mitigation, he \nnoted that this incident occurred nearly three years earlier and no similar action has \noccurred. He also commented that no classified information was copied onto his USB \nDevice. He repeated that his actions were not intentional. He claimed that E1 permitted \ndata to be transferred between computer systems using external hard drives, though he \nacknowledged that transferring E1PI to a personal mobile device was not authorized. \nParagraph 3, Guideline E \u2013 This paragraph also cross-alleges under Guideline E \nthe facts set forth under Guideline K. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation. \nHowever, his denial was based upon his mistaken belief that the Guideline E allegation \nconcerns a falsification in his SCA for his failure to disclose the August 30, 2018 security \nincident. In fact, the SCA predated August 30, 2018, by three weeks. Instead, the cross-\nallegation concerns the incident itself, as an independent personal conduct security \nconcern. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified at length about the circumstances surrounding \nthe August 30, 2018 incident. He explained that E1 had two computer networks and that \non occasion information had to be transferred from one network to the other. Certain files \nwere so large that they could only be transferred by a USB external hard drive device. \nThe administrative process to do this required the completion of a form by the employee \ntransferring the files. The form must be approved to authorize the employee to perform \ntransfers between networks. While performing his duties at E1, Applicant had submitted \nthis form and had permission to transfer files on a USB drive between the two networks. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWithout such an approval, the system would not deny him access to the company\u2019s \nnetwork when he plugged in a USB hard drive. Applicant claimed that it was not necessary \nto use a company-issued USB device to transfer files. This testimony is inconsistent with \nthe E1 Memorandum, which stated that Applicant had violated company policy prohibiting \nthe connection of a personally owned device to E1\u2019s technology infrastructure. (Tr. at 22-\n26; GE 3 at 2.) \nApplicant further testified that he was required to use an external USB device only \nfor work-related information. He admitted that one mistake he made on August 30, 2018, \nwas that he used an external USB device to transfer his personal files. That required \ngetting permission from \u201cIT.\u201d He claimed he was unaware of that requirement at the time \nhe left the company. The form he had previously prepared to obtain permission to use an \nexternal USB device required confirmation that the permission sought was to perform \nroutine work-related activities. (Tr. at 26-28.) \nA complication that increased the risk of Applicant\u2019s actions is that he did not \nseparate his personal files from his work files on his section of the E2 shared drive used \nto store information. Under any single \u201cparent folder,\u201d he would have subfolders \ncontaining both personal and work files. He referred in his testimony to \u201ca nested tree\u201d of \nparent folders and sub-folders with further sub-folders and even more sub-folders. He \nused a chronological approach to his filing system so that all of his activities in a given \nperiod, both work-related and personal, would be in that one main file, separated into sub-\nfolders. As a result, when he copied over to his USB Device a parent folder that he thought \nhad his academic literature as well as personal information, such as tax and pay \ninformation, the parent folder would also include sub-folders with E1PI. The Windows \ncopying technology he used was simple \u201cdrag and drop,\u201d so he dragged and copied file \nfolders that contained both work-related files and personal files. In that process, nothing \nwas removed from the E1 system, it was just copied. He did not review each folder to see \nif it had only personal files. He was going through the process of copying hundreds of \nfolders hastily over an hour or two at the end of his last workday at E1 before Labor Day \nweekend. He agreed he made a mistake in how he handled the copying. Nevertheless, \nhe testified that it was only his intent to copy his academic and personal files. He \npurchased the USB Device about a week earlier. It was solely for the purpose of \ntransferring his files in connection with his change of employment. (Tr. at 28-31, 47-55, \n71-74.) \nApplicant also transferred files from his emails that included both personal emails \nand work emails. He testified that E1 allowed personal use of its email system. Some of \nthe email files he copied may have been work-related. He believes that a large number \nof the other files he transferred onto his USB Device were publicly available documents \nthat he was required to download periodically for work purposes. Those files are large \nand numerous. (Tr. 31-34.) \nApplicant contends that with the permission he had to use portable USB devices \nto transfer files for work-related purposes, he did not violate any company policies by his \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactions on August 30, 2018. He does not believe he violated any policy by plugging his \nUSB Device into the E1\u2019s network on that date. (Tr. at 76-77; GE 3 at 2.) \nWith hindsight, Applicant now realizes that he should have talked to E1\u2019s IT \nDepartment and explained what he wanted to do with his personal computer files, even \nthough he already had \u201cUSB access\u201d approval. The day he left the company, he had an \nexit interview in which he turned over all of his IT equipment. He had the opportunity then \nto talk about his use of the personal USB Device, but the subject never came up since \nhis actions were only discovered in the following days. His job at E1 was related to \ninformation security in connection with a specific DoD project. His new job at E2 was also \ndealing with information security, but at the organization level. Nevertheless, he insisted \nat the hearing that the information he claims he copied inadvertently would not be helpful \nto him in his new position with E2. (Tr. at 61-65, 76-77.). \nOther Mitigating Evidence \nWhen Applicant was interviewed as part of his background investigation, he claims \nhe learned for the first time the seriousness of his actions when he left E1. He decided \nto take actions to avoid future problems like this one, and he enrolled in a cyber \nawareness course provided by DoD in 2019 and again in 2021. He also teaches a course \nin cyber security at a local university. In connection with that experience, he further \neducated himself on such matters. (Tr. at 39-45; AE D at 1-2.) \nApplicant testified that prior to the August 2018 incident, he had never been \ncounseled or written up for being careless with information technology, nor has he had \nany security issues since the incident. He testified that since he was instructed by E1\u2019s \ninvestigators in September 2018 to return the USB Device, he has been transparent with \neveryone about the incident. (Tr. at 45-46.) \nApplicant\u2019s exit from E1 in 2018 was the first time he had ever gone through this \ntransition process. He had three weeks from the date of his new job offer from E2 to his \nlast day at E1. He had much to do, including a geographic relocation. He deferred the \ncopying process to his last day of work and performed it quickly in a limited amount of \ntime. He did not take the time to see what sub-folders were included in each folder he \ncopied and whether the folders he was copying contained any E1PI. He testified that \nthroughout his 11 years at E1, he was aware of E1\u2019s rule that you cannot take E1PI when \nyou terminate your employment with the company. (Tr. at 55-56.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

The passage of three years since \nApplicant\u2019s departure from E1 and his actions of copying a large number of files from the \nE1 information technology network onto his USB Device were not so long ago as to \nmitigate his actions. While his violations of the company\u2019s policies were infrequent and \noccurred under the unusual circumstances of Applicant resigning his position with the \ncompany, those facts do not mitigate serious security concerns arising under these \nguidelines. The fact that he was leaving E1 to begin working at another major DoD \ncontractor suggests that Applicant\u2019s motives in copying E1 proprietary information were \nnot innocent. This is exactly what the E1 investigators concluded when they determined \nthat their counterintelligence and counter terrorism concerns were \u201csubstantiated.\u201d As \ndiscussed below, I did not find credibility in Applicant\u2019s testimony that his downloading of \nE1PI was \u201cinadvertent.\u201d Moreover, his actions standing alone, without regard to his intent, \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 35(c) and AG \u00b6 41(d) are only partially established. Applicant has suggested \nthat he did not receive proper training from E1 over his 11 years working there as an \ninformation assurance engineer regarding the procedures he should have used to copy \npersonal files from the E1 network upon his departure from the company. The record is \nsilent as to what training he did receive, though it is noted that his responsibilities were in \nthe field of information security and it is likely that E1, as a major DoD contractor, would \nproperly trained its information security professionals. Also, Applicant was highly \neducated and testified at length about his personal studies in this field. Even if he had \ninsufficient training, he had the opportunity at his exit interview to discuss his actions and \nintentions, if they were indeed innocent, but he failed to do so. \nAG \u00b6 35(d) and AG \u00b6 41(c) are not established. Applicant failed to carry his burden \nto prove that his conduct was unintentional or inadvertent. His demeanor and testimony \nlacked credibility, and the inconsistencies between his testimony and the other evidence \nin the record further undermined his credibility. He testified that he was unaware that E1 \nbelieved he had done anything wrong until his background interview a year later. This \nwas inconsistent with the fact that he received a copy of the E1 Memorandum on \nSeptember 7, 2018, advising him that he had violated company policies on August 30, \n2018. He also testified that he has been fully transparent about the August 30, 2018 \nincident, yet he did not voluntarily answer a question during his background interview \nabout any past misuse of information technology systems. At that point in time, he knew \nfrom the E1 Memorandum that his actions had raised a serious security concern. He had \nto be confronted by the investigator with information from his E1 employment records \nbefore he would discuss the incident. Also, Applicant is a highly educated information \nsecurity specialist who fully understood the folder structure of his data on E1\u2019s computer \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsystem. It is highly unlikely that he simply made a mistake while acting hastily on the day \nof his departure from the company. But even if Applicant\u2019s actions were inadvertent, he \ndid not report them, let alone report them promptly. The fact that he returned the USB \nDevice when instructed has some mitigating value, but not much. Once his actions were \nidentified, he had no choice but to comply with the investigators\u2019 instruction. His return of \nthe USB Device does not satisfy the good-faith requirement of AG \u00b6 41(c). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15, which, in relevant \npart, provides, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \nThe following conditions under AG \u00b6 16 have possible applicability to the facts of \nthis case and may be disqualifying: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information;   \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources;  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nAssuming arguendo that Applicant\u2019s actions on August 30, 2018, are not sufficient \nfor an adverse determination under any other single guideline or that his actions are not \nexplicitly covered under any other guideline sufficiently to support an adverse \ndetermination, then AG \u00b6 16(c) and (d) have been established. The record evidence \ncontains credible adverse information, which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \nindicating that Applicant may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s actions of violating two policies of E1 and his downloading of over 15,000 files \non the last day of his employment with E1 before commencing work for E2 constitute \u201ca \npattern . . . of rules violations\u201d and a \u201csignificant misuse of. . . [his] employer\u2019s time and \nresources.\u201d \nFurthermore, the evidence established the applicability of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e) and (f).\nApplicant\u2019s conduct could affect his personal and professional standing if it became \nknown by his current or future employers and that fact creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress by others. His violation of E1\u2019s information protection \npolicies violated the commitment he made when he became employed by E1 that he\nwould comply with its policies. Such a commitment was a condition of his employment.  \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 17 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. Three of these mitigating conditions have \npossible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s violations of E1\u2019s policies are not minor \nand cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Without general \nauthorization or his employer\u2019s explicit prior approval, Applicant copied files from the \ncompany\u2019s network that contained E1PI. That conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is only partially established. Applicant has acknowledged his actions \nrequired the prior approval of his employer. He has taken steps to educate himself further \non DoD information security procedures. There is a serious question, however, whether \nsuch additional education was necessary because Applicant\u2019s area of education and \nprofessional expertise is information security. Even a non-expert employee would readily \nunderstand the security risks presented by plugging a privately purchased USB device \ninto the employer\u2019s computer network and copying files without the employer\u2019s \npermission. \nAG \u00b6 17(e) is not established. Applicant offered no evidence that he has advised \nhis current employer and others about his actions on August 30, 2018, and E1\u2019s response \ncharging him with violating E1\u2019s policies. As long as this is information is not disclosed to \nApplicant\u2019s current employer, he has not mitigated the potential vulnerability he faces to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue \nnational security eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense \njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person \nconcept. In applying the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct, all relevant circumstances, and the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d); specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines K, M, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and considered the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Additional \ncomments are warranted. Applicant is a mature and highly educated cyber security \nengineer. The nature, extent, and seriousness of his conduct speaks for itself. The fact \nthat he did not seek his employer\u2019s prior approval to copy files onto his USB Device \nstrongly suggests that he knew that such approval would be denied or highly supervised. \nI also found Applicant\u2019s testimony and demeanor while testifying to lack credibility on the \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissue of whether his actions of copying thousands of files from his employer\u2019s computer \nnetwork, some of which contained E1PI, was inadvertent. I conclude Applicant knew \nbetter and was seeking to do something without his employer\u2019s approval while hoping he \nwas acting \u201cunder the radar\u201d of his employer in the afternoon of his very last day of work \nthere. Unfortunately for Applicant, E1\u2019s computer system detected his unusual activity of \ndownloading of large numbers of files, and an investigation ensued. E1 investigators \nfound that their counterintelligence and counterterrorism concerns were substantiated. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation fell far short of satisfying his burden to establish \nmitigation of the security concerns raised by his conduct. \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his handling protected information, use of information technology, and \npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 28, 2020, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

He timely responded to the FORM on March 18, 2021, \nand provided additional exhibits. His supplemented exhibits were admitted without \nobjection as Items 7 and 8. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated one delinquent loan debt of \n$37,800. Allegedly, this debt remains unresolved and outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the alleged delinquent bank loan \ndebt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a with explanations and clarifications. He claimed he is \ncurrently negotiating a settlement with the creditor\u2019s collection service. In furtherance of \nhis settlement negotiation, he claimed he is looking to complete a settlement with the \ncollection service that will enable him to borrow from his 401(k) retirement account \nwithout exceeding the maximum oan amount permitted by law. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 57-year-old mechanical supervising design engineer of a defense \ncontractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and \nadmitted by Applicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. \nAdditional findings follow. \nBackground \n \nApplicant married in June 1986 and divorced in September 2010. (Item 3) He has \none adult child (age 33) and two stepchildren (ages 40 and 28) from this marriage. (Item \n3) He earned an associate\u2019s degree in March 1985. (item 3) He currently resides with \nhis partner and one of his adult children. Applicant reported no military service. (Item 3) \nSince August 1999, Applicant has worked for his current employer as a \nmechanical design engineer. (Item 3) Most recently, he has served as a supervising \nmechanical design engineer. Applicant has held a security clearance since July 1999. \n(Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nCredit reports document that Applicant obtained a home equity loan in December \n2004 from a bank lender that was secured by a second trust deed on his house. (Item \n5) Due to income shortages, Applicant became delinquent in his loan payments, and the \nlender charged off the loan in 2020. (Item 5) Applicant attributed his home loan default \nin part to his 2011 divorce.

(Item 4) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can\nalso be caused or exacerbated  by, and thus can be a possible indicator of\nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s incurrence of a delinquent home \nequity loan. Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties with this loan warrant the \napplication of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration \nguidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies.  \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \nincurrence of a delinquent home loan, while isolated and somewhat aged, raises initial \nsecurity concerns over the stability of his finances.  \nSince defaulting on his home equity loan in 2017, Applicant has made \nconsiderable progress in resolving the one delinquency in his otherwise positive \nfinancial profile. His concerted payoff initiative enables him to take advantage of three \nmitigating conditions (MCs). MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; \n20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medial \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of \nsuch debts.

Applicant\u2019s admission and comment are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been with his employer since January 1998, and currently serves as a senior specialist. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1993. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was married in 2002 and divorced in 2010. He remarried in 2015. He has two children, born in 2004 and 2018. It is unclear if he was ever granted a security clearance, because he stated that he was \u201cbadged\u201d to work at a federal department \u201cwithout an escort.\u201d Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse Applicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. Marijuana makes him feel relaxed. Although he claims to not know the quantity of marijuana he used each time he used it, he offered the following frequency estimate to describe his over three-decades of marijuana use: he started smoking marijuana at concerts and at home two times per week in June 1987, and continued such use while in college through at least 1993; in 1993 he decreased his use to once a month, an",

A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on May 4, 2021, and he was afforded \nan opportunity, within a period of 30 days, to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on July 7, 2021. His response was due on August 6, 2021. \nApplicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of August 24, 2021, no response had \nbeen received. The case was assigned to me on September 24, 2021. The record closed \non August 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with a brief comment to the factual \nallegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). \nApplicant\u2019s admission and comment are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \nBackground \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been with his \nemployer since January 1998, and currently serves as a senior specialist. He received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1993. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was married in \n2002 and divorced in 2010. He remarried in 2015. He has two children, born in 2004 and \n2018. It is unclear if he was ever granted a security clearance, because he stated that he \nwas \u201cbadged\u201d to work at a federal department \u201cwithout an escort.\u201d \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was \nmarijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. Marijuana makes him feel relaxed. \nAlthough he claims to not know the quantity of marijuana he used each time he used it, \nhe offered the following frequency estimate to describe his over three-decades of \nmarijuana use: he started smoking marijuana at concerts and at home two times per week \nin June 1987, and continued such use while in college through at least 1993; in 1993 he \ndecreased his use to once a month, and continued that frequency until at least 2015; in \n2015, his use decreased to two to three times per year, and continued until at least June \n2019. He last smoked marijuana at a concert. Several months later, he found out he \nneeded a security clearance, so he contends he stopped his \u201coccasional use.\u201d He also \nnoted that he never expected to need a clearance. He does not intend to use marijuana \nin the future because it is not addictive and he has no need to use it. (Item 3, at 37-38; \nItem 4, at 6-7; Item 2, at 2) During his October 2, 2019 interview with an investigator from \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), he acknowledged that he purchased \nmarijuana initially when he was in high school, and also did so periodically as recently as \n2017 in a state where it is legal. (Item 4, at 6-7) \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was initially candidly reported by him in his SF 86. \n(Item 3, at 37-38) He has never received counseling or treatment as a result of his use of \nmarijuana. (Item 3, at 39; Item, 4, at 7) \nPolicies \n \n(4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including. . . purchase. . . .  \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser. He frequently \npurchased and used marijuana for over three decades, until as recently as June 2019. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) has been established, but for reasons set forth below, AG \u00b6 25(c) was not \nestablished. While Applicant\u2019s purchases of marijuana were known to the DCSA CAF \nbefore the SOR was issued, his purchases were not alleged in the SOR. Nevertheless, it \nis appropriate to consider such unalleged issues in the whole-person analysis. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) minimally applies. After over three decades of using marijuana, \ncontinuing to do so as recently as June 2019, a little over two years ago, Applicant was \nsurprised to learn that he would need a security clearance. There is no evidence of \nApplicant ever having received treatment and counseling as a result of his illegal use of \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \na controlled substance for over three decades. The circumstances of his use of marijuana, \nhis surprise that he would now need a security clearance, and his new assertion that he \nwould not continue to use marijuana in the future because it is not addictive and he has \nno need to use it, do not constitute sufficient evidence to indicate that it is unlikely to recur. \nHe was open about his use of marijuana when he completed his SF 86, and for that \ncandor, he is given credit. He acknowledged his drug involvement and substance misuse, \nbut he offered no evidence of actions taken to overcome those issues, such as exploring \ndrug treatment and therapy; changing or avoiding the environment where marijuana was \nused; providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility; or evidence to support his claimed abstinence \nsince June 2019. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history of \nover three decades of marijuana use, the relatively brief period of a little over two years \nof reported abstinence is considered insufficient to conclude that the abstinence will \ncontinue. Applicant\u2019s claimed new compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, is in stark \ncontrast to his cavalier attitude towards those same laws, rules, and regulations. His use \nof marijuana despite knowing that such use was prohibited by both the Government and \nhis sponsor, and his refusal, until recently, to disavow future marijuana use, continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unalleged purchases of marijuana will \nbe considered only for the five purposes listed above.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 50-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been with his employer since January 1998, \nand currently serves as a senior specialist. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1993. \nWhen completing his SF 86, he was candid in acknowledging that he had used marijuana. \nHe now claims that he will abstain from all illegal drug behavior, drug involvement, and \nsubstance misuse. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser. He routinely purchased and \nused marijuana, a controlled substance, for over three decades, continuing to do so until \nas recently as June 2019 \u2013 a little over two years ago. Based on his comments, it appears \nthat he would have continued using marijuana had he not been surprised that he now \nneeded a security clearance. He has never received treatment and counseling as a result \nof his illegal use of a controlled substance. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on May 7, 2021. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 6, 2021, scheduling the \nhearing for August 10, 2021. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf.

He obtained his high school \ndiploma in 2008. He completed his undergraduate degree in 2014. He did not serve in \nthe military. Applicant completed his security clearance application on January 24, 2020. \nThis is his first request for a security clearance. He is employed with a technology \ncompany since January of last year. (Tr. 13-14) Applicant has his own consulting \ncompany in the Bahamas, which he started in 2016. (GE 1). (GE 1, Tr. 15) He is a \ndevelopment engineer, among other things. (Tr. 23) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has delinquent debt in the approximate amount of \n$41,849. The debts include consumer loans, a vehicle repossession and collection \naccounts. Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR \u00b61.a-h. without explanations. \nApplicant noted that he has had various periods of unemployment over the years and \nsome firings because he left a project in 2018, so that he could be with his wife in the \nBahamas for their official wedding. They were married in 2016 in a simple ceremony in \nthe United States. (Tr. 24) His salary at that time was about $135,000 or $140,000. He is \ncurrently earning $60,000 to $70,000. (Tr. 16) \nApplicant acknowledged his financial hardship started in 2018, when he returned \nfrom his wedding abroad. (Tr. 16) He was unemployed from October 2019 to January \n2020. In the interim, he was fired from a position from July 2019 to October 2019. (GE 1) \nHis SF86 reflects other firings from employment as early as 2010. (GE 1) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s investigative April 2020 subject interview, he stated that he \nknows that he has various debts and will pay them once he is financially able. He had not \nmade any payment plans at that time either. (GE 2) Applicant basically stated the same \nthing about each debt. The one debt he acknowledged was a loan in 2016, a $40,000 \nloan for his official wedding in the Bahamas. He noted that his wife will one day be the \nPrime Minister of the Bahamas. (Tr. 76) As to some other debts, he would research them \nand when he is financially stable he would pay them. (GE 2) \nAs to SOR 1.a, a debt in the amount of $6,475 for the balance on a vehicle that \nwas repossessed in 2019. He bought the high-end vehicle in 2016. Applicant tried to \nnegotiate with the credit union for pennies on the dollar, but they did not agree. (Tr. 29) \nApplicant submitted a letter, dated July 15, 2021, setting up a payment plan for $300 a \nmonth. (AE K) He stated that he was going to pay at some point, but because this was \nimportant for his security clearance, he would go ahead at that time and begin to resolve \nthe debt. (Tr. 35) In the letter another loan is referred to and that would be SOR 1.d to the \nsame credit union for $100 a month. (Tr. 36) The charge-off amount was $14,077. (AE K) \nHe submitted proof of a payment of $100 and $300 from Applicant\u2019s account in 2021. (AE \nO). \nAs to SOR 1.b, a past-due account from 2017, in the amount of $645, Applicant \nprovided information that he has a balance of $2,929.67 as of July 2021. This is for tires \nand wheels for his vehicle. He stated that it was resolved in 2019 because the company \ntook his car.

(Tr. 40-41) He offered EX Q showing the same balance and that he had made \nthree payments of $31. In July and August 2021. The letter stated that he has 93 of 96 \npayments remaining, with a final payment due in April 2029. (AE Q) He could not provide \nany proof of payment. (Tr. 43) \nAs to SOR 1.c, a charged off account in 2019, in the amount of $15,443. Applicant \nopened this credit card account in 2014. He stated that it was probably used for travel or \nhis wedding. (Tr.44) He stated that it was resolved in 2019, but he knew it was just \u201cshut \noff.\u201d He took no actions to resolve it. (Tr. 45) He submitted (AE M) to show that he made \na payment of $100 in June 2021. The current balance is $15,243. \nAs to SOR 1.e, a charged-off account in the amount of $1,919 for a \u201crolling pay pal \naccount, he did not remember. However he paid the account on May 14, 2021. (Tr. 52, \nAE L, H) \nAs to SOR 1.f, a charged-off account in the amount of $473, Applicant paid the \ninsurance account in May 2021. He has multiple cars. (Tr. 46) He admitted that he made \nno earlier efforts to pay. (AE N, H) \nAs to SOR 1.g, a collection account in the amount of $358, this was an outstanding \nenergy bill. He said that this is ridiculous worrying about minor \u201cstuff\u201d. (Tr. 56) He paid \nthe bill in August 2021. (AE O. P) He stated that he is trying to \u201csell you guys weapons \nhere. This is ridiculous.\u201d (Tr. 55) He continued to elaborate that why is the Government \nworrying about such accounts when he is developing things that are a thousand times \nworse than nuclear weapons.\u201d (Tr. 57) \nSOR 1.h a collection account in the amount of $232 is for another energy account. \nApplicant has been aware of it for a long time. (Tr. 59) He paid it on July 15, 2021. (AE \nR) \nApplicant does not have a budget. He stated he always had enough money (Tr. \n73), and he has not sought financial counseling. His current employment earns him (after \ntaxes) about $4,000 ($50,000 per annum). His wife makes about $2,400. (Tr. 60) His \nconsulting company is dormant. (Tr. 61) He believes he has about $1,000 in his checking \naccount. His wife purchased a car and paid for it in full. He was not sure what he spends \non food, because some is for business expenses. \nThe remaining exhibits that Applicant presented (AE S-AF) deal with his patent \nwork for the Government and the current state of global affairs. His plan is to go back to \nmaking lots of money because he is not going to sit around and make little amounts of \nmoney. (Tr. 73) He stated that he has a \u201cwhole list of projects and engineers lined up for \nthe military to get *s\u2014t* in gear.\u201d (Tr. 73) He also noted that he is setting up something in \nanother state to import labor from the Bahamas and build a base to run on for a political \npositon there. He wants to stabilize the Bahamas so we can deal with China.

(Tr. 77) He started addressing accounts \nand debts in 2019 or 2021 \u2026.. because you also have the last name which \u201cmesses me.\u201d \n(Tr. 84, See pages 87 to 88 for more information on his global or domestic projects.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted his debts alleged in the SOR, and that they were not of concern \nto him given the fact that he knew he could pay everything when he had a good paying \njob. He took out a loan for $40,000 for a wedding and did not worry when it would be paid. \nHe has started paying on his debts and a few small ones are resolved. After the issuance \nof the SOR, Applicant began to contact some of the creditors and or dispute the accounts. \nHe knew if he waited long enough, he could pay pennies on the dollar based on his \nexperience as a debt collector. \nHe would leave a job or be fired if he had a personal priority. While he has been \nunemployed, he did not act responsibly once he obtained full-time employment. He \nadmitted that he tried to negotiate with his creditors. He presented some mitigation but \nwaiting to pay is not a substitute for good-faith efforts to repay debt. He has been gainfully \nemployed since January 2020. He spent his money on things that were not necessary. \nHe showed poor judgment and responsibility and put his efforts into engaging his own \ncompanies. Sufficient time has not lapsed to establish a history of good-faith efforts. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved except for a \nfew initial payments recently. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant did not present any credible explanation \nfor the delinquent debts or that circumstances beyond his control caused the delinquent \ndebts. He did not act responsibly to address the resulting debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not receive any financial \ncounseling, nor are there clear indications that his financial situation is under control. Only \nrecently did he begin to address the debts when he realized that a security clearance and \nemployment were in jeopardy. He reiterated that he has plenty of things that he is working \non for the military at the moment, but did not meet his evidentiary burden demonstrating \nhis finances are in good order. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h against Applicant. \nWHOLE PERSON Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including his open disdain for the security clearance process and \npriority for his own various companies and projects, I conclude that Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns raised by his financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: Against Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 29, 2018. The \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DCSA CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 2, 2020, \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The DCSA CAF \nacted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DOD as of June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 1, 2021, and elected a decision on the \nwritten record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n\n2 \n \n(DOHA). On March 31, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 6 (Items).  \nApplicant was sent the FORM on April 8, 2021, and he received the FORM on April 20, \n2021. He was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM \nor submit any documentation. The SOR and the answer (Item 1) are the pleadings in the \ncase. Items 2 through 6 are admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on \nJuly 21, 2021.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is 57 years old. He is twice divorced and has one adult daughter, age \n35. He served in the Army National Guard from 1982 to 1983. He received an honorable \ndischarge and immediately enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He served on active duty until \nhe received an honorable discharge in July 1991. Since January 2018, Applicant has \nbeen employed by a defense contractor. His job title is field technician. He previously \nworked for another federal contractor from January 2009 to October 2017 as an avionics \ntechnician before resigning from his job due to \u201cfamily and personal issues.\u201d He was \nunemployed from November 2017 until his current employment in January 2018. (Item 2, \nItem 3) \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has nine delinquent debts \ntotaling nearly $45,000. Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i. \n(Item 1)  \n \nApplicant disclosed several delinquent accounts on his May 2018 SCA. He also \nlisted: \u201cTo (sic) complicated to state here and would like the opportunity to explain \n(financial issues) face to face.\u201d During Applicant\u2019s background interview in October 2018, \nhe explained that his financial hardships started in 2012. His daughter was going through \na divorce at the time and he started providing financial assistance to her and his \ngrandchildren. This financial support was provided despite the harm he suffered by not \nbeing able to pay all of his own monthly expenses, causing his accounts to become \ndelinquent. The investigator discussed several outstanding accounts listed on his July \n2018 credit report, to include the delinquent vehicle loan for his truck, and his home \nmortgage which reflected a foreclosure had been initiated. Applicant agreed with all of the \ndelinquent accounts and told the investigator that he was working to resolve his financial \ndelinquencies. He was earning more money in his current job than he did working for his \nprevious employer. (Item 2, Item 3, Item 4) \n \nThe Government\u2019s brief noted that Applicant had not provided any documentation \nwith his response to the SOR. Department Counsel recommended that Applicant provide \ndocumentation in response to the FORM to show the efforts he had taken to resolve the \n\n3 \n \nfinancial issues. Doing so would be \u201cbeneficial for mitigation and review by an \nadministrative judge.\u201d To date, Applicant has not provided any supporting documentation.  \n \nA May 2019 credit report showed that not one of the delinquent accounts alleged \nin the SOR had been resolved, settled, or was in the process of being paid. His mortgage \ndelinquency had increased from $24,194 to $27,123 when compared to his July 2018 \ncredit report, and a new delinquent account appeared on the 2019 credit report. In April \n2020, another credit report was obtained. It also showed that not one single delinquent \naccount alleged in the SOR had been resolved, settled, or was in the process of being \npaid. The smallest unpaid debt alleged in the amount of $28 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) remained \nunchanged and outstanding on all three credit reports obtained in 2018, 2019, and 2020. \n(Item 4, Item 5, Item 6) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n4 \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n5 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness continues to this day. His financial problems have existed \nover an extended period of time despite the higher paying job he obtained in 2018 with \nhis current employer. His daughter\u2019s 2012 divorce was a situation beyond his control, but \nproviding financial assistance to the detriment of one\u2019s own finances does not show \nresponsible or prudent action under the circumstances. There is insufficient evidence in \nthe record to show that Applicant made any good-faith effort to address his overdue debts. \nThere are no clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved, or his \nfinances are under control. Future financial problems are likely to occur. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis. \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old and has been employed by a federal contractor since \nJanuary 2018. He did not provide any evidence of payments, payment plans, or other \nactions to resolve the debt alleged in the SOR. There is no track record of steady, \n\n6 \n \nsystematic payments over an extended period of time. His actions show a lack of financial \nresponsibility and raise questions about his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to \nprotect classified information. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. \nOr. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of \nthe whole person. I conclude that financial consideration concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.i:  \n                     \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nPamela C.

(Item 4 at 5) \nApplicant did not include his delinquent debts in response to Section 26 of a security \nclearance application completed in May 2020. At an investigative interview with an Office of \nPersonnel Management investigator in August 2020, Applicant volunteered his largest \ndebt, totaling $17,484, as alleged in subparagraph 1.a, as well as the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.c, totaling $3,862. He contends that he misread the question. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s ability to begin satisfying his debts faster was hampered by \ncircumstances related to the pandemic, and medical bills generated by a car accident. \nHowever, he readily attributed the incurrence of his financial delinquencies to \nirresponsibility. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances,\u201d does not apply. Nevertheless, since December 2019, Applicant has either \nsatisfied his SOR debts entirely, or has been working towards their satisfaction through \narranged payment plans. Moreover, he maintains a budget (a sign of financial stability), \nand has ample after-expense monthly income to pay off the remaining debts through the \npayment plans. Under these circumstances, the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20 apply: \n(c)  . . .  there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; [and] \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good\u2013faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nUnder these circumstances, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concern. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful \nand candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n15) Applicant\u2019s failure to list any of his delinquent debts on his security clearance raises the \nissue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities,\u201d applies. \nThe debt that Applicant voluntarily disclosed at his subject interview totaled \napproximately double the amount of the next highest delinquency alleged in the SOR. The \ntotal amount of the debt disclosed voluntarily totaled more than half of the delinquent \nbalance. Under these circumstances, I conclude Applicant had no intent to mislead the \ngovernment when he completed the security clearance application. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant has either satisfied his debts or has arranged payment plans. These steps \nindicate that Applicant has rehabilitated his finances, eliminating any vulnerability to \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. Upon considering this case in the context of the \nwhole-person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern. \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant has used marijuana, \nfrom 2014 to at least March 2020. \nHe used it before being hired by a defense \ncontractor, after being hired by a defense contractor, and even after applying for a \nsecurity clearance, disregarding DoD policy, company policy and Federal law. \nApplicant knew or should have known that the use of marijuana is against Federal law \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \nand prohibited by the defense department in any form or fashion. He should also be \naware of his company policy. Moreover, Applicant intends to continue using marijuana \nin the future. Applicant is a college-educated man whose actions show immaturity, \nuntrustworthiness and poor judgment. Applicant does not meet the requirements for \neligibility to access classified information. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant has chosen to live his life to his \nconvenience, and has disregarded the law. \nUnder the particular facts of this case, \nApplicant does not show the requisite character or judgment of someone who has the \nmaturity, integrity, good judgment, and reliability necessary to access classified \ninformation. At this time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to \nclassified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Applicant plans to continue using marijuana \nin the future, a controlled substance that is against Federal law. An individual who \nholds a security clearance is expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has \nnot demonstrated the level of maturity necessary for access to classified information. \nThis is not an individual with whom the Government can be confident to know that he \nwill always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even when no one is \nlooking. He is not qualified for access to classified information. Applicant does not \nmeet the qualifications for a security clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The evidence is not sufficient to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate his history of financial problems that consists primarily of a number of federal \nstudent loans in collection. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non November 1, 2019. (Exhibit 4) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. He provided additional information when interviewed in January \n2020 during a background investigation. (Exhibit 5) Thereafter, on December 4, 2020, \nafter reviewing the application and the information gathered during a background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort \nMeade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was \nunable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information.

He requested a decision based on the written record \nin lieu of a hearing. \nOn March 31, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation, some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits herein. The FORM \nwas mailed to Applicant, who received it on April 12, 2021. His reply to the FORM was \nreceived on April 16, 2021. It consists of a six-page memorandum and two pages of \nsupporting documentation, all of which are admitted as Exhibit A. The case was \nassigned to me on May 17, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information for his job with a federal contractor. He works part-time as a \ntechnician at a military installation. He has been so employed since August 2019, \nalthough he noted in his Answer that he and all other part-time employees were off work \nfrom December 11, 2020, through January 17, 2021. Before his current job, he worked \nas a part-time truck driver for four different firms for several years during 2012-2019. He \nis married and has one adult child. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes honorable military service. He initially \nserved in the Army National Guard during 1987-1989. Next he was a Sailor on active \nduty with the Navy during 1989-1994. He reported that he held a security clearance \nwhile in the Navy. (Exhibit 4 at Section 25) He then served in the Navy Reserve during \n1994-1998. \nThe SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of 11 delinquent \naccounts as follows: eight student loans in collection for a total of about $31,305; two \ncollection accounts in amounts of $583 and $396; and one medical collection account \nfor $256. In addition to his admissions, the delinquent accounts are established by \ncredit reports from December 2019 and March 2021. (Exhibits 6 and 7) \nApplicant disclosed his delinquent federal student loans when he completed his \n2019 security clearance application. (Exhibit 3 at Section 26) He reported an estimated \nbalance of $55,576. He stated he defaulted on the loans due to an inability to satisfy the \ndebts because he was providing for his family. He explained the indebtedness was in \nrepayment via wage garnishment that withheld 15% of his disposable pay every pay \nperiod until the balance is paid in full. The student loans stem from his attendance at a \nstate university more than ten years ago.

He also attached a one-page document, a copy of IRS Form \n1089-E, which shows the sum of $6,103 in student loan interest was received by the \nlender or creditor during tax year 2019. \nIn his reply to the FORM, Applicant explained that after completing his studies at \nthe state university, payments for the student loans were in deferment, forbearance, or \npostponed for several years. He stated that he was repaying the loan indebtedness via \nthe wage garnishment. The only documentation he provided concerning the student \nloans were two documents from December 2018; both are from the third-party collection \nagency assigned to collect the student loans; and, taken together, the documents show \na total amount owed of $24,296 as of December 2018. (Exhibit A) Applicant did not \nprovide a current account statement for the student loans, nor did he provide other \npaperwork to document a payment history for the loans. Given these circumstances, I \nam unable to determine the current amount owed, but there is substantial evidence to \nfind Applicant\u2019s earned income is subject to wage garnishment for payment of his \ndefaulted student loans. \nApplicant also stated he was able to repay the three collection accounts without \nwage garnishment, but he did not provide any supporting documentation concerning \nthose debts. I find that these debts are not resolved. \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n2\n3  484 U.S. at 531. \n  484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here.  \n                                                          \n \n \n \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5  Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6  \nDiscussion \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n5 \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated his history of \nfinancial problems, which are unresolved and ongoing. I have reviewed all of the \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and conclude none are fully applicable. \nApplicant has made some progress by repaying the defaulted student loans via wage \ngarnishment, but that is not considered a truly voluntary means of repayment. With that \nsaid, he failed to provide adequate documentation to show the total amount he currently \nowes on the defaulted student loans, nor did he establish a paper record of his payment \nhistory for the loans. Likewise, he failed to provide documentation showing any forward \nprogress to resolve the three relatively minor collection accounts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn deciding this case, I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service and his \nmultiple part-time jobs going back to 2012, which no doubt limited his ability to repay \ndelinquent debt while at the same time meeting his current financial obligations. \nNevertheless, Applicant has not done enough to mitigate the security concern stemming \nfrom his history of financial problems. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

When asked when his most \nrecent use of Ayahuasca occurred, he refused to answer the question. (Tr. p. 30.) \nApplicant also used DMT, which is an active ingredient within Ayahuasca. Applicant \nstated that it should have occurred the same time he used Ayahuasca. (Tr. p. 30.) \nApplicant stated that this drug allows a person to access old memories from early life. \n(Tr. p. 38.) When asked when his most recent use of DMT occurred, he refused to \nanswer the question. (Tr. p. 31.) Applicant also used inhalants such as nitrous oxide. \nHe refused to answer the question concerning his most recent use of inhalants. (Tr. p. \n32.) Applicant has also used cocaine or crack, and he refused to indicate when his \nmost recent use occurred. (Tr. p. 32.) Applicant also used Ketamine for the first time in \n2015. When asked when his most recent use of Ketamine occurred, Applicant refused \nto answer the question. (Tr. p. 37.) Applicant stated that Ketamine is often used as a \nveterinary tranquillizer. (Tr. p. 37.)   \nApplicant testified that the use of at least some of these substances occurred at \nmusic festivals. He stated that it was in 2013 that he started attending music festivals. \nHe stated that he has used illegal drugs at parties. When asked when the last time was \nthat he attended a party, he refused to answer the question. (Tr. p. 33.)  \nApplicant\u2019s responses to the undated interrogatories reflect some dates he \nstarted and last used a particular drug. However, none of the information in this form \nwas corroborated because Applicant refused to answer all questions regarding his most \nrecent use of these illegal drugs. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nIn August 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with Felony and \nmisdemeanor charges for possession of a controlled substance; possession of a \nnarcotic controlled substance, and possession of marijuana. At the time of his arrest, \nApplicant had in his possession LSD, MDMA, THC and marijuana.  (Government Exhibit \n3.) Applicant testified that following the arrest, he continued to use all of the illegal \ndrugs he was arrested for. (Tr. p. 34.) He stated that they just drove through a police \ncheck point, heading to a known party, and were illegally searched. Applicant was \nfound in possession of the above-mentioned illegal drugs, and was arrested. Applicant \nstated that news reports regarding this procedure indicate that the head of the police \ndepartment in that area was fired following this arrest.  (Tr. p. 44.)  \nApplicant stated that in his opinion the DoD Directive is severely outdated in \nterms of effectiveness. (Tr. p. 47.) He believes that he is sufficiently trustworthy and \nreliable to properly protect Government information, regardless of his history. (Tr. p. \n47.) \nFour letters of recommendation submitted by professional associates, coworkers \nand friends collectively attest to Applicant\u2019s excellent work performance, strong \ninterpersonal and leadership skills, and reliability, and honesty. \nNone of these \nindividuals is aware of the extent of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains two conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nand \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Applicant refused to answer \nany questions about his most recent illegal drug use. His failure to cooperate in this \nregard shows immaturity, and an implied attempt to hide information from the \ngovernment. Thus there is insufficient information in the record to make a proper \ndetermination as to his eligibility. It not clear from the evidence whether he continues to \nuse illegal drugs, has reduced his use, increased his use, or has stopped. Applicant \nhas not shown the requisite good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness necessary to \nbe eligible for access to classified information. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted \nor convicted. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Neither of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record reflects one arrest in 2013, and several charges for \nillegal possession of several different controlled substances. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct \ndemonstrates poor judgment, immaturity and a total disregard for the law. His criminal \nconduct is inexcusable. Applicant has not established that he is sufficiently reliable and \ntrustworthy to access classified information. His extensive illegal drug use, his refusal \nto answer questions regarding his most recent drug use, and his arrest for possession \nof controlled substances gives rise to serious concerns about his judgment, reliability \nand trustworthiness, both because of the nature of the offenses, and the circumstances \nsurrounding the offenses. The before-mentioned disqualifying conditions have been \nestablished and are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

He has a high school \ndiploma and approximately two years of college courses. He is employed by a defense \ncontractor as an Engineer. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to the Federal government for \ndelinquent taxes for tax years 2014, 2015 and 2016. He is also indebted to six other \ncreditors for accounts that have either been placed for collection or charged off. \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the \nApplicant dated January 4, 2019, and December 22, 2020, confirm the indebtedness. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in March 2020. He has had \nconsistent employment as an engineer since April 2012, with no period of \nunemployment. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1995 to 1999, and received an \nhonorable discharge. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that his financial problems were \ncaused by his wife\u2019s mismanagement of funds, her failing to timely file their income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 through 2016, and his prior period of unemployment from \n2011 to 2012. (Government Exhibit 2.) The following delinquent debts set forth in the \nSOR are of security concern: \n1.a.  A delinquent debt is owed to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the \namount of $7,834.12 for tax years 2014, 2015 and 2016.  Applicant states that he is \ncurrently in payment plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the amount of $500 \na month.  There is no evidence in the record that shows that he has started making \npayments toward the debt yet.  (Government Exhibit 4.) \n1.b.

A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for a repossessed vehicle that was charged \noff in the approximate amount of $15,097. The debt remains owing. \n1.d.

A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection \nin the approximate amount of $213.  The debt remains owing. \nApplicant did not file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and \n2016 until after receiving the CAF interrogatories in February 2020. \n(Government \nExhibit 4.) \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated December 22, 2020, indicates that he \npurchased a vehicle for $47,328 in or around November 2020. (Government Exhibit 6.) \nThis was not a prudent decision given the fact that he has so many outstanding \ndelinquent debts. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts include Federal taxes, a car loan and medical debts \ntotaling in excess of $30,000. Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2014, 2015, and 2016 in a timely fashion. He also failed to pay his Federal \nincome taxes for 2014, 2015 and 2016. He also became indebted to a number of \ncreditors whose accounts were either charged off or placed for collection. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;    \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant is delinquently indebted to each of the creditors set forth in the SOR. \nHe has failed to provide sufficient evidence in mitigation. He gives no reasonable \nexcuse for his failure to file his income tax returns on time, or pay his taxes. His only \nclaim is that his wife mismanaged the funds. Given his experience, military background, \nand advanced education, Applicant knew or should have known the legal requirement to \nfile his income tax returns and pay his Federal income taxes in a timely fashion. The \nfact that he did not file his income tax returns until he received the CAF interrogatories \nin February 2020 shows either that he could not afford to pay his taxes, or that he was \nnegligent about it. In any case, Applicant knew that he had financial delinquencies and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunfiled tax returns at the time he completed his security clearance application in \nNovember 2018. Buying an expensive car, waiting years to file his taxes, and not \nresolving even minor delinquent accounts shows poor judgment and unreliability. \nApplicant has done little to nothing to show that he has resolved his delinquent debts. \nHe shows a desire to resolve them, but nothing more. Applicant\u2019s inaction for so long \nreflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. Accordingly, \nApplicant does not meet the requirements to access classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 7, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was unable \nto find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility. \nThe DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any \nadjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. On December 31, 2020, Applicant answered \nthe SOR, and admitted the allegation. He requested a decision on the written record.

He did not do so. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 51-year-old married man with six children. He earned an associate \ndegree in 1992 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. (Item 3 at 11) Since 2019, he has been \nworking for a government contractor as a draftsman. (Item 1 at 14) \nApplicant failed to file, as required, his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 \nto 2018. (Item 2) He contends that he did not file his income tax returns because he was \ngoing through difficult financial times during this period. (Item 2) He did not elaborate. He \nestimates that he owes between $25,000 and $70,000 in delinquent taxes. (Item 3, Item \n5). Applicant also stated that he is working with a tax resolution company to help him file \nhis tax returns and pay any amount due. (Item 2)  He provided no documentation. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct;(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . .  An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. \nApplicant failed to file his federal income tax returns between 2012 and 2018 \nbecause of what he described as financial hardship. Consequently, AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(f), \n\u201cfailure to file . . . federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, \nstate, or local income tax, as required,\u201d apply. \nThe following migrating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed, and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s income tax returns remain unfiled. He did not elaborate on his \nexplanation for not filing his income tax returns, and his assertion that he is working \nwith a tax resolution expert is not supported by any record evidence. Under these \ncircumstances, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant did not merely fail to file timely one or two tax returns late; he failed to file \ntax returns for several consecutive years. As such, he violated Federal law with impunity. \nUnder these circumstances, the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct is \nsignificant. He offered no evidence related to the surrounding circumstances of his failure \nto file his income tax returns, other than a vague, unsubstantiated contention that he was \nexperiencing financial hardship. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole-\nperson concept, I conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n4 \n",

The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19.

I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a history of delinquencies, \nand still owes past-due debts totaling about $20,900. Applicant has not demonstrated \nthat future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been \nestablished. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c~1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g. and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i. and 1.j: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He has tax delinquencies, and at least \ntwo past-due debts he has yet to address. He has not demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Financial \nConsiderations is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all facts and circumstances surrounding \nthis case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d. through 1.k:  \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n12/02/2021 \nDecision \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from circumstances beyond his control. \nHe started the process to resolve his delinquent accounts before he received the \nStatement of Reasons (SOR). He acted responsibly under his circumstances and has \nresolved his financial problems. Financial considerations security concerns are \nmitigated. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on April \n16, 2019, seeking the continuation of his clearance eligibility. He answered a set of \ninterrogatories from the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) on December 16, 2019. After reviewing the \ninformation gathered during the background investigation, the DOD CAF issued \nApplicant an SOR on January 28, 2021, alleging security concerns under Guideline F \n(financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR on February 15, 2021, provided \nmaterial to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns, and requested a decision based \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), containing the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant. He responded to \nthe FORM on July 7, 2021, and submitted evidence in extenuation and mitigation and of \nhis efforts to resolve his financial problems. He raised no objections to the \nGovernment\u2019s proffered evidence. The case was assigned to me on August 30, 2021. \nWithout objections, I admitted and considered the Government\u2019s proposed evidence \nand Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent accounts, two in collection and seven charged-\noff accounts, totaling over $78,000. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of \nthe SOR financial allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i), and submitted extenuating and \nmitigating documentary evidence. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 66 years old. He completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1977. He was \ncommissioned in the U.S. Army in 1978 and served honorably on active duty until his \ndischarge in 1985. He then joined the Inactive Reserve where he served until his \nhonorable discharge in 1997. He possessed a security clearance during his military \nservice. Applicant has been married to his wife since 1993. He previously married in \n1982 and divorced in 1992. He has two children and two stepchildren all of whom are \nadults. \nApplicant has been working for his current employer and security sponsor, a \nlarge federal contractor, since June 2009. He is senior principle supplier engineer. He \nhas held access to classified information at the secret level during all of his \nemployment. He is considered to be a highly valuable and trustworthy employee. His \nperformance ratings show he has been rated as \u201cexceeding requirements\u201d, as an \n\u201cexceptional contributor\u201d, and as a \u201chighly effective contributor.\u201d \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his April 2019 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed that he was experiencing financial problems. He explained that his wife\u2019s \nearnings were $2,000 a month until she was laid off in early 2018 and was unemployed \nuntil late 2018. (Answer to the FORM) While she was unemployed, and later on after \nshe found a job at a reduced salary ($1,300 per month as of December 2019), he \noverextended himself financially by using credit cards to pay for two mortgages and \nliving expenses. Applicant and his wife own two homes, one purchased in 2009, and the \nsecond in 2014. The first residence they use during the work week to minimize the \ncommuting distance between his home and his work location. The second home they \npurchased in 2014 as a retirement home, and they use it during weekends, holidays, \nand vacations. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn November 2018, Applicant realized his income alone, without his wife\u2019s \nearnings, was insufficient to pay their debts and living expenses. He did not know if or \nwhen his wife would find employment. Concerned about his ability to pay debts and to \navoid losing his homes, Applicant retained the services of a debt-resolution company to \nhelp him negotiate and resolve his delinquent accounts. At the time that he retained the \ndebt-resolution company, none of his accounts were placed for collection or charged off. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2018 debt resolution agreement shows that the he enrolled 10 \naccounts, including all of the accounts alleged in the SOR, totaling close to $90,000. \n(FORM, Item 5) Shortly thereafter, he started making monthly deposits of $1,342 to the \ndebt-resolution company to be used to settle and pay his debts. \nAttached to his answer to the SOR, Applicant submitted documentary evidence \nshowing that the debt-resolution company settled (for less than what he owed) six of the \naccounts alleged in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d through 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i). Additionally, attached \nto his answer to the FORM, Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that \nthe debt-resolution company settled (for less than what he owed) two of the remaining \naccounts alleged in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g). The only account that has not been \nsettled or resolved is SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant stated, and the documents submitted \nindicate, that this account is scheduled to be settled sometime in November 2021. \nBecause he already settled eight delinquent accounts, I find it is likely that he will settle \nand resolve the remaining delinquent account. \nAs of December 2019, Applicant and his wife were earning a monthly net salary \nof about $11,746. According to their budget, his wife was netting $1,300 per month and \nthey had a monthly remainder of about $1,570, after paying their debts and living \nexpenses. Applicant noted that their financial problem was a onetime occurrence and \nafter taking corrective action through the debt-resolution company, they are now back \non a secure financial footing. He indicated that his financial situation is stable. He stated \nthat they have made the necessary adjustments to their lifestyle to assure they will not \nface similar financial problems in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports show that he is living within his financial means, and \nthat he has acquired no additional delinquent accounts. Although Applicant presented \nno evidence to show he has received financial counseling, he retained the services of a \ndebt resolution company to help him resolve his financial problems, and has been \npaying his delinquent accounts. There is no record evidence showing that Applicant had \nfinancial problems in the past. \nApplicant highlighted his over 40 years of service to the United States, first \nthrough his honorable military service, and since 2009, as an employee of a large \nfederal contractor. He believes that he has been an exemplary employee, ensuring the \nsecurity of all information and equipment entrusted to him both in the military service \nand as a contractor employee. His performance appraisals confirm that he is considered \nto be a valuable and trustworthy employee. He was rated as \u201cexceeding requirements\u201d, \nas an \u201cexceptional contributor\u201d, and as a \u201chighly effective contributor.\u201d (FORM answer) \n3 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. \nA \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. His wife was laid off \nin early 2018, and when she found employment it was for a lower salary. Because of the \nreduced earnings, he was concerned about his ability to pay debts, living expenses, and \ntwo mortgages. In November 2018, he retained the services of a debt-resolution \ncompany that advised him to let the accounts become delinquent. He subsequently \nacquired the nine delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 19 provides \ndisqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in \nthis case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAll of these mitigating conditions are partially or fully supported by the facts in this \ncase. Applicant developed financial problems after his wife was laid off and their \nearnings were reduced. His income alone was insufficient to pay the two mortgages, \naccrued debts, and living expenses. Thus, I find that his financial problems could be \nattributed to, or were aggravated by, circumstances beyond his control. \nI do not believe Applicant acted improperly or was financially negligent by owning \ntwo homes. He was financially capable of paying the two mortgages from 2014 until his \nwife was laid off in early 2018. It was not until after his wife was laid off that his income \nbecame insufficient to pay their accrued debts and his financial problems started. \nApplicant was financially diligent by retaining the debt resolution company before his \ndebts became delinquent or were charged off. I find that he has been financially \nresponsible under his circumstances. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to resolve \nfinancial issues in the future, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. \nIn this instance, there is no evidence of prior financial problems. Circumstances \nbeyond his control contributed to his financial problems. He started to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts before the SOR was issued. He settled and resolved eight of the \nnine delinquent SOR accounts and acquired no additional delinquencies. His actions \nare sufficient to demonstrate his current financial responsibility, and that his financial \nproblems are being resolved and are under control. Because he already settled and \nresolved eight delinquent accounts, I find it likely that he will resolve the remaining \ndelinquent account. The financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n6 \n\n \n \n____________________________ \nApplicant, 66, served on active duty as an officer for 8 years and 13 years in the \nInactive Reserve. He was twice honorably discharged. He held a clearance while in the \nservice. He has been employed with a federal contractor and has possessed a \nclearance since 2009. There is no evidence of any security concerns, except for those \nin the current SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to establish that circumstances beyond his \ncontrol contributed to or aggravated his financial problems. He has been financially \nresponsible addressing his delinquent accounts within his financial means. He \nestablished a viable plan to resolve the accounts alleged in the SOR. He resolved or \npaid 8 of the 9 SOR accounts. He is in control of his finances. Given the opportunity, I \nbelieve that Applicant will resolve or pay the remaining SOR account. Because of his \nservice, experience possessing a security clearance, and the security clearance \nprocess, Applicant likely understands that he is required to maintain his financial \nresponsibility to be considered eligible for a clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to classified information for his job with a federal contractor. He works full-time as a security officer. He has been so employed since January 2020. He has not held a security clearance in the past. (Exhibit 3 at Section 25) He is married, although he and his spouse are living separately while working on their marriage. He has no children. His educational history includes a high school diploma awarded in 1992. He also attended a state university for a time without earning a degree. In his security clearance application, Applicant reported two periods of unemployment in the recent past. (Exhibit 3 at Section 13A) He worked for several years as an account manager for a technology company until he was laid off in October 2015, when the company moved a number of jobs overseas. (Answer at 7) He was then unemployed from October 2015 to November 2016, a period of about one year. He was hired as a data manager for a one-year project, which ran from November 2016 to November 2017. When the project ended, he was unemployed from November 2017 to February 2018, a period of about four months.

Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non March 12, 2020. (Exhibit 3) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. He provided additional information when interviewed during a \nbackground investigation.

His answers were mixed; he \nprovided explanatory remarks in a three-page memorandum; and he also provided a \none-page enclosure showing an employment termination in October 2015. He \nrequested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn January 31, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation, some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits herein. The FORM \nwas mailed to Applicant on March 23, 2021; he received it on April 23, 2021. He timely \nreplied to the FORM with a one-page memorandum, which is admitted as Exhibit A. The \ncase was assigned to me on May 27, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information for his job with a federal contractor. He works full-time as a \nsecurity officer. He has been so employed since January 2020. He has not held a \nsecurity clearance in the past. (Exhibit 3 at Section 25) He is married, although he and \nhis spouse are living separately while working on their marriage. He has no children. His \neducational history includes a high school diploma awarded in 1992. He also attended a \nstate university for a time without earning a degree. \nIn his security clearance application, Applicant reported two periods of \nunemployment in the recent past. (Exhibit 3 at Section 13A) He worked for several \nyears as an account manager for a technology company until he was laid off in October \n2015, when the company moved a number of jobs overseas. (Answer at 7) He was then \nunemployed from October 2015 to November 2016, a period of about one year. He was \nhired as a data manager for a one-year project, which ran from November 2016 to \nNovember 2017. When the project ended, he was unemployed from November 2017 to \nFebruary 2018, a period of about four months. He then transitioned his career to \nworking in security, and he has worked continuously in this field since February 2018. \nThe SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of six delinquent \naccounts in amounts ranging from $163 to $13,105 for a total of about $20,176. The \ndelinquent accounts are described as in collection. He admitted with explanation the \nthree collection accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. He denied with explanation the \nthree collection accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.f. In addition to his admissions, the \nsix delinquent accounts are established by credit reports from March 2020 and October \n2020. (Exhibits 5 and 6) \nApplicant disclosed the largest delinquent account for $13,105 in his security \nclearance application. (Exhibit 3 at Section 26) He stated that he fell behind and \ndefaulted on a car loan after he was laid-off from his job in October 2015. The vehicle \nwas subject to voluntary repossession. Otherwise, he did not disclose any delinquent \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccounts in his security clearance application. In his background investigation, his \nanswer to the SOR, and his response to the FORM, Applicant points to the job layoff in \nOctober 2015 and the following one-year period of unemployment as the circumstances \nthat resulted in his inability to satisfy his financial obligations. \nApplicant has provided various explanations for the six delinquent accounts. But \nhe has not provided any supporting documentation concerning the accounts. He has not \npresented reliable documentation (e.g., account statements, cancelled checks, \ncorrespondence from a creditor) showing that any of the accounts were paid, settled, \nentered into a repayment agreement, disputed, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise \nresolved in his favor. Nor has he presented any supporting documentation to establish a \nreasonable plan to resolve the delinquent accounts. I find all six delinquent accounts in \nthe SOR are unresolved. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nThe disqualifying conditions noted above apply here. Applicant fell behind on his \nfinancial obligations and was unable to pay certain creditors due to a job layoff in \nOctober 2015 and the following one-year period of unemployment.  \n \n \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated his history of \nfinancial problems, which are unresolved and ongoing. I have reviewed all of the \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and conclude none are fully applicable. In \nparticular, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b)\u2014concerning circumstances largely \nbeyond one\u2019s control\u2014does not apply here. Certainly, his job layoff and one-year period \nof unemployment were circumstances largely beyond his control. But he has not acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, because he has not provided any documentation \nto establish a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve the six delinquent accounts.  \n                                                          \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old self-employed health-care recruiter. She has worked for a federal contractor since March 2019. She married in September 1997 and has an adult stepdaughter. She has lived in a home that she owns since October 2003. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2001 and a master\u2019s degree in December 2004. She has never held a security clearance or been cleared for a public trust position.

In Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, she submitted evidence that on June 7, 2021, after she had received the FORM, she had resolved four credit-card debts not alleged in the SOR. (AX A.) The SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $33,525, of which about $21,847 is unresolved. The delinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from April 2021, August 2020, January 2020, and April 2019. (FORM Items 4-7.)

I conclude that she waived any objections to the \nPSI summaries.

She told the investigator that she believed she \nhad about $40,000 in debts, of which about $15,000 was delinquent. She told the \ninvestigator that she had not received any financial counseling or any assistance from a \ndebt consolidation service. (FORM Item 8 at 5.) \nThe April 2021 credit report reflects that the payments on Applicant\u2019s home \nmortgage loan are current. (FORM Item 4 at 6.) She has not provided any information \nabout her income, expenses, or assets. \nPolicies \nThe standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nSEAD 4, \u00b6 E.4. A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must \npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for assignment to a public trust position.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. The decline in Applicant\u2019s business and her \nuninsured medical expenses were conditions largely beyond her control. She has acted \nresponsibly by working two part-time jobs in addition to working to revive her business \nand working for a federal contractor. She has resolved several debts not alleged in the \nSOR and the two debts alleged in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.j. She is making payments on \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h. However, she submitted no evidence \nof responsible conduct regarding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.i. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant presented no evidence that she has sought \nor received financial counseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, \nand 1.g. It is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.i. In \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM, she declared her intention to resolve these four debts. \nHowever, \u201c[p]romises to pay or otherwise resolve delinquent debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner or otherwise acting in a \nfinancially responsible manner.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-04110 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019) citing \nISCR Case No. 14-04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015). An important element of good \nfaith and responsible conduct is maintaining contact with creditors. Applicant presented \nno evidence that she has contacted the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.i. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c and 1.d are Applicant\u2019s largest debts, and she \nhas resolved only the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nThe adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has good intentions, but \nher good intentions have not yet evolved into a reasonable and credible plan that includes \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.i. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations. \nAccordingly, I conclude that she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant her eligibility for a public trust position. \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI have considered that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused in large part by \ncircumstances beyond her control, and that she has acted responsibly regarding some of \nher debts. However, she has not yet reached the point where the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress has been sufficiently diminished. Delinquent debts \ntotaling $21,847 are unresolved, and she submitted no evidence of steps to resolve them. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.e-1.h, and 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 40 years old. He married in 2004 and divorced in 2009. He has three children ages 17, 14, and 6. The two older children live with Applicant. The younger child lives in another state. Applicant has been employed by federal contractors since at least 2008, with a period of unemployment from May to August 2019. He has been with his present employer since August 2019. He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item 3) Applicant served on active duty in the military from October 2004 to December 2005 and was honorably discharged. He then served in the National Guard from 2008 to 2014. He tested positive for opioids or oxycodone on a random drug test, administered by his National Guard unit, in May 2013. In September 2014, he received a General Discharge for alcohol or other drug abuse. Applicant acknowledged using an expired prescription of oxycodone. (Items 3, 4) Applicant\u2019s medical records reflect that he was prescribed oxycodone by his doctor. While he was being weaned off this drug, another drug was prescribed as a replacement. The medical records show that on December 2, 2011, his doctor authorized him to take a maximum of four oxycodone 15 milligram tablets a day.

He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 2 through 7. Applicant provided a timely response. He did \nnot object to the Government\u2019s evidence. He submitted one document that is marked as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A. The Government had no objections. Items 2 through 7 and AE \nA are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on October 20, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except \u00b6 3.c, which he denied. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He married in 2004 and divorced in 2009. He has three \nchildren ages 17, 14, and 6. The two older children live with Applicant. The younger child \nlives in another state. Applicant has been employed by federal contractors since at least \n2008, with a period of unemployment from May to August 2019. He has been with his \npresent employer since August 2019. He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item \n3) \nApplicant served on active duty in the military from October 2004 to December \n2005 and was honorably discharged. He then served in the National Guard from 2008 to \n2014. He tested positive for opioids or oxycodone on a random drug test, administered \nby his National Guard unit, in May 2013. In September 2014, he received a General \nDischarge for alcohol or other drug abuse. Applicant acknowledged using an expired \nprescription of oxycodone. (Items 3, 4) \nApplicant\u2019s medical records reflect that he was prescribed oxycodone by his \ndoctor. While he was being weaned off this drug, another drug was prescribed as a \nreplacement. The medical records show that on December 2, 2011, his doctor authorized \nhim to take a maximum of four oxycodone 15 milligram tablets a day. On December 12, \n2011, he was advised by his doctor that the continued use of a narcotic for pain \nmanagement had potential problems, such as dependence and tolerance. The doctor \ndiscussed with Applicant alternative pain management methods and the plan to reduce \nhis prescribed narcotic medication. On December 28, 2011, the doctor reduced the daily \nmaximum to three tablets; and on January 25, 2012, the prescription was reduced to a \nhalf-tablet to be taken as needed every six hours during the first week, every eight hours \nduring the second week, every twelve hours during the third week, and once a day during \nthe fourth week. After the fourth week, Applicant\u2019s doctor directed him to stop taking \noxycodone. (Item 4) \nOn January 30, 2012, the doctor prescribed a new replacement medication. The \nmedical records show that during Applicant\u2019s appointments, the doctor assessed whether \nApplicant was becoming dependent on oxycodone.

His prescription expired in 2012 or 2013. He did not use all of \nthe pills during the period the prescription was valid and had pills left over. (Item 4) \nAfter his military discharge, though he was no longer prescribed oxycodone, \nApplicant stated he continued to take about one tablet a month until October 2019 from \npills that were left over from his prior prescriptions. Although he had oxycodone pills that \nwere originally prescribed to him, he was no longer authorized to take them, as noted in \nhis medical record. He told the government investigator that he did not believe taking the \npills was illegal or wrong after the prescription\u2019s expiration date because the pills had \nbeen prescribed to him. (Item 4) \nApplicant held a security clearance during the time he was taking the expired and \nunauthorized oxycodone prescription. He told the government investigator that he \nintended to get a new prescription because he was unaware that using an expired \nprescription was an issue or concern. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated: \nI did not know of any law or regulation preventing me from taking as needed \nexpired medication that was prescribed to me. I had spoken to my doctor \nback then about not prescribing me anymore due to the fact I had some left \nfrom my previous prescriptions, but I was told to have them filled and just \ntake as needed. (Item 2) \nAgain I was unaware I was not allowed to take expired medication that was \nprescribed to me. (Item 2) \nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) in September 2019 \nand did not disclose any financial delinquencies. He did not disclose that he failed to file \nfederal and state income tax returns for any tax year. During his October 2019 \nbackground interview, he disclosed that he had not timely filed his federal or state income \ntax returns for tax years 2015 through 2018. His explanation for failing to disclose this \ninformation on his SCA was that because he believed he was due a refund, he did not \nhave to disclose his failure to file on his SCA. He did not have an explanation for why he \nfailed to timely file the returns for tax years 2015 through 2018. He told the investigator \nthat he was in the process of trying to obtain his W-2 income statements for the delinquent \nyears, so he can file. Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR, will not \nbe considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when applying \nmitigating conditions, making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \n(Items 3, 4) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant received Government interrogatories on December 11, 2020. In his \nFebruary 2021 response, he indicated he had filed his 2017, 2018, and 2019 federal and \nstate tax returns on December 14, 2020. He stated he was unable to find his W-2 income \nstatements for tax years 2015 and 2016, but he was moving soon, and he would go \nthrough his boxes to find them, and then file the tax returns for these years. He anticipated \nhe would receive refunds for these tax years. He did not provide copies of his 2017, 2018, \nor 2019 federal or state income tax returns to show when or if they were filed. He indicated \nin his response to interrogatories that he did not owe federal income taxes for 2017, 2018, \nor 2019. He stated he did not owe state income taxes for 2017 or 2019, but owed $157 \nfor 2018 and that he mailed a check for the amount to the state. No documentary proof \nwas provided. (Item 4) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview, he disclosed that he was approximately \n$12,000 in arrears for child support. He explained that his child\u2019s mother did not file for \nchild support until 2015, when the child was one-year-old. Applicant had sent money for \nthe child and was given credit for his payments by the court, but he still owed about \n$7,500. He said that an additional $100 was being taken from his pay each month, but \nbecause he had a period of unemployment, he was unable to make the payments and \nthat is why he believed he owed about $12,000. In his FORM response, Applicant stated \nthat his child support arrearage was satisfied when he filed his delinquent tax returns and \nrefunds were applied to the arrearage. He did not provide any documentary evidence to \nsubstantiate his tax returns were filed and his child support is in good standing. (Items 2, \n4; AE A) \n \nApplicant did not disclose other delinquent debts in his SCA. He was confronted \nby the investigator with the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($341); 1.b ($149); 1.c ($1,200); \n1.d ($4,511); 1.f ($796); and 1.g ($558). Applicant denied being aware of any of the \ndelinquent debts, except SOR \u00b6 1.f, which was owed to the Defense Financial and \nAccounting Service (DFAS) for failing to return equipment before his military discharge. \nHe said he lost it. Applicant told the investigator that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was for car \ninsurance that he let expire, and he thought it was paid in full. Regarding all of the alleged \ndebts, he told the investigator that he would follow up with the creditors. In his SOR \nanswer, he admitted all of the debts except SOR \u00b6 3.c, which he denied, stating he did \nnot know what the debt was for. He did not provide information on what action he may \nhave taken to research this debt. All of the SOR debts are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and credit reports from September 2019 and December 2020. (Items 3, 4, 5, \n6) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated he had resolved the DFAS debt, \nbut provided no documentary proof. He stated that he cannot find his W-2 income \nstatements to file his 2015 and 2016 federal and state income tax returns. They remain \ndelinquent. He is confident he was entitled to receive refunds, but because it has been \nmore than three years since the required filing date, he would not receive them. Regarding \nthe resolution of his remaining debts he stated: \u201cI fully intend to have them paid in full. I \nwould like to have them paid off within the next year or so if not earlier from my taxes next \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nyear.\u201d He provided no other information regarding the resolution of any of his other \ndelinquent debts. (AE A) \nAs part of Applicant\u2019s government interrogatories, he provided a personal financial \nstatement. He does not list any debts that he is currently paying. He notes at the end of \nthe month he has a surplus of $1,791. (Item 4) \nApplicant also stated that he has never committed a security violation. He takes \nhis job seriously and considers it an honor to work on projects that give the United States \nmilitary advantages on the battlefield. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant tested positive for opioids or oxycodone on a random drug test while \nserving in the National Guard in May 2013. After his General Discharge for drug abuse, \nhe continued to use pills from an expired prescription for oxycodone from about 2013 until \nOctober 2019. Applicant misused oxycodone while holding a security clearance from \nabout 2013 to 2018. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility;  \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant was prescribed oxycodone while serving in the military. Medical records \ncorroborate he was weaned off the drug and then told to stop using it. He continued to \nmisuse the expired oxycodone prescription after he was discharged from the National \nGuard with a General Discharge for illegal drug use. Subsequently, he continued to \nmisuse the drug until he was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for using the expired prescription was because he did not believe \nit was unlawful to do so. Applicant was on notice after his discharge that his misuse of the \nexpired prescription was improper. The medical records specifically noted that he was \ntold to discontinue its use in January 2012, and he was prescribed a new medication as \na substitute. I did not find Applicant\u2019s statements credible. His misuse of oxycodone from \n2013 to 2019 is aggravated by the fact he held a security clearance during most of this \ntime. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct occurred over many years and there is insufficient evidence to \nconclude it is unlikely to recur. His failure to recognize that he should have discontinued \nthe use of an expired prescription after his discharge from the military for drug use, shows \npoor judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. Other than Applicant\u2019s statement, there is no \nother evidence to conclude that Applicant has stopped misusing oxycodone or has sought \na medical opinion regarding any dependency issue. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) and 26(d) do not apply. \nThere is some evidence that Applicant\u2019s abuse of oxycodone was due to a back injury \nthat was prolonged. The fact that he continued to use his left over pills after his doctor \ntold him to stop raises concerns about his reliability and trustworthiness.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. \nApplicant failed a random drug test by testing positive for oxycodone while serving \nwith the National Guard in May 2013. He was misusing an expired prescription for \noxycodone from approximately 2012 to May 2013. He was separated from the service \nwith a General Discharge for drug abuse. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s continued use of an expired prescription for oxycodone after his \ndischarge from the military demonstrated poor judgment. He failed to follow his doctor\u2019s \norder to stop using oxycodone in January 2012, which led to his General Discharge. His \nconduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. I do not have \nsufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct has ceased or he has sought \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling regarding his long-term misuse of oxycodone.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax required. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in \napproximately 2015. He failed to timely file his 2015 through 2019 federal and state \nincome tax returns. Despite having approximately $1,791 in surplus each month, there is \nno evidence that Applicant is making payments toward delinquent debts other than using \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrefunds from his tax returns. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file \nor pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nApplicant admitted all of the debts in the SOR, except SOR \u00b6 3.c. He did not \nprovide evidence for why he failed to timely file his federal or state income tax returns for \n2015 through 2019. Despite discussing his failure to file his 2015 through 2018 federal \nand state tax return with the government investigator in October 2019, he repeated his \nconduct by not timely filing his 2019 tax returns. Applicant stated he cannot find his W-2 \nincome statements to file his 2015 and 2016 tax returns. He did not provide evidence that \nhe contacted the IRS to resolve the issue. His presumption that he is entitled to receive \na refund does not mitigate his failure to comply with the law. Although he stated that he \nfiled his 2017 through 2019 federal and state income tax returns, no corroborating \ndocuments were provided. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nApplicant indicated he was paying support for his child, but in 2015, the mother \nfiled for court ordered support when the child was a year old. Applicant had a period of \nunemployment in 2019. Both of these matters may have impacted his finances and been \nbeyond his control. He stated that his child support arrearage was satisfied when his \ndelinquent federal income tax returns were filed in December 2020 and refunds were \ninvoluntarily applied to it. He provided no documentary evidence that his delinquent \nreturns were filed, a refund was applied to his arrearages, or that his child support is \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncurrent. Applicant has not provided evidence that he has voluntarily addressed any of his \nother delinquent debts. The evidence is insufficient to conclude he has acted responsibly \nor that financial issues are unlikely to recur. There is no evidence of financial counseling. \nUsing tax refunds as a financial management plan to pay delinquent debts is not \nconsidered a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. None of the mitigating conditions full \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines, H, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to conclude he has established a track record of being fiscally responsible. His \nfailure to timely file income tax returns for multiple years shows an inability to comply with \nrules and regulations. His continued misuse of oxycodone while holding a security \nclearance raises serious questions. The record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuidelines H, drug involvement and substance misuse, Guideline E, personal conduct, \nand Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 21, 2020. On \nDecember 10, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The DCSA CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 4, 2021 (Ans.), and requested a decision \nbased on the written record without a hearing. The Government\u2019s written brief with \nsupporting documents, known as the file of relevant material (FORM), was submitted by \nDepartment Counsel on March 26, 2021. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nrebut, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on May 25, 2021, \nbut did not submit a reply. The case was assigned to me on August 17, 2021. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5 are admitted into evidence without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old operations manager, employed by a government \ncontractor since November 2016. He was unemployed from July to September 2009, and \nfrom August to November 2016. He graduated from high school in 1982 and joined the \nU.S. Army Reserve while in high school, and remained until he was discharged in \nNovember 1982 to join the U.S. Marine Corps. He served on active duty in the Marine \nCorps from December 1982 to December 1986, when he was honorably discharged. He \nhas been married since 1987 and has one child and one stepchild. Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance was previously suspended in 1984 due to a court-martial proceeding while he \nwas on active duty. He was last granted a security clearance by the Department of \nHomeland Security in 2015. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has 13 delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $61,225. One account is a medical collection, while the remaining \ndelinquencies are consumer debts in collection or charged off. Applicant admitted all of \nthe SOR allegations, with explanations. \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had health problems over the \npast few years, including receiving a pacemaker in April 2020 that caused him to fall \nbehind on his debts. He noted in his SCA that he was out of work due to major surgery \nand rehabilitation for 90 days, and his work hours were reduced. He is also providing \nfinancial support to his daughter and granddaughter. In his SCA, Applicant listed a 2011 \njudgment and wage garnishment for a vehicle loan debt after a repossession, and other \nunresolved debts that arose due to \u201cmedical issues [that] have led to my poor financial \nstatus.\u201d (GE 3) Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) indicates three other \njudgments from 2019 on accounts listed as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.e, and 1.g \u2013 1.h. (GE 4) His \n2020 credit bureau report shows his SOR debts date between 2014 and 2020. (GE 5) \n \nApplicant planned to file a petition in bankruptcy, but was unable to do so in 2020 \ndue to pandemic-related court access restrictions. He noted in his January 2021 Answer \nthat the bankruptcy court reopened to the public \u201ca few weeks ago.\u201d To date, Applicant \nhas not provided any evidence that he filed bankruptcy, or that he has taken any other \naction to resolve his debts. He notes that he continues to perform his job \u201cat a high level\u201d \nand that his debts will not cause him to be compromised. \n \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s June 2020 PSI, Applicant has a monthly net remainder of \n$342 after paying his expenses. Applicant\u2019s spouse is disabled and receives a disability \nincome that is separate from his finances. Applicant and his spouse do not discuss their \nfinances with each other. No evidence of financial counseling or Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial status was included in the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n\n \n4 \n \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and documentary evidence in the record are sufficient to \nestablish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant asserted that his debts resulted from financial losses due to health \nproblems, but failed to provide persuasive evidence that these health issues significantly \nimpacted his income or ability to resolve his debts over the years involved. He has been \n\n \n5 \n \nemployed by a Government contractor since 2016, but continued to allow his debts to \nremain unresolved. There is no evidence of action taken to resolve debts except for an \nintent to file a bankruptcy petition. Additionally, there is no evidence of financial \ncounseling or satisfactory evidence of Applicant\u2019s current financial status. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems have been longstanding and remain a current \nconcern. I am not persuaded that Applicant has a handle on his debts, has taken sufficient \naction to resolve delinquent debts, or that he has shown financial responsibility over the \nyears. As a result, I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, health problems, and periods of unemployment. However, \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show the resolution of SOR debts and \nhis overall financial responsibility. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant or continue eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She \nprovided no documentation to confirm her assertion. \nThere is no information in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s salary, use of a \nfinancial counselor, budget, or income. Applicant provided no documentation to support \na specific plan for resolving her financial issues. \n Policies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \nand 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted, and her credit reports confirm, that she is responsible for the \ndelinquent debts. She did have circumstances beyond her control, but she did not act \nresponsibly. She paid one of her smaller debts recently although she has had the \ndelinquent debts for several years. She promised in her 2020 investigative interview to \nstart payment plans, however she did not provide sufficient information to support a \ntrack record of financial stability. She paid one of her smaller debts, and submitted two \n$100 payments on her larger debts. She has not presented any financial arrangement \nagreements. She has received no financial counseling. She has not provided any \ndocumentation that supports any of the mitigating conditions. She receives partial \nmitigation for a condition beyond her control, but did not act to resolve any delinquent \naccounts until after her SOR. \nBased on the lack of evidence produced by Applicant, it is difficult to conclude \nshe made a sufficient good-faith effort to resolve her debts, or that her financial situation \nis under control. Despite gainful employment, there is no evidence that Applicant has a \nmeaningful track record of financial responsibility in this case. She has not met her \nburden and none of the mitigating conditions apply. Any doubts must be resolved in \nfavor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

(Applicant Exhibit J; Tr. \n36-38.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. Applicant \nadmitted the allegations under this paragraph, with qualifications. \nApplicant filled out an e-QIP on March 13, 2020. (Government Exhibit 1.) Section \n26 of that questionnaire concerned Applicant\u2019s financial record and has several subparts. \nAs stated in the SOR, with regard to this case, Applicant was asked if, in the seven years \nbefore the date he filled out the questionnaire, he had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency, or had an account suspended, charged off or cancelled for failing to \npay as agreed. Applicant answered these questions, \u201cNo.\u201d This was a false answer to a \nrelevant question about Applicant\u2019s financial history. \nApplicant stated in his Answer about his negative response to the financial \nquestions, \u201cI admit to improperly reading and answering the question.\u201d During his \ntestimony Applicant stated, \u201cI believe I misread the question or read it too fast.\u201d (Tr. 25, \n38-39.) \nSection 13A of the same questionnaire asked Applicant about his employment \nthusly, \u201cList all of your employment activities, including unemployment and self-\nemployment, beginning with the present and working back 10 years.\u201d For each period of \nemployment the questionnaire also asked the reason for leaving. The reasons include, \n\u201cFired, Quit after being told you would be fired, Left by mutual agreement following \ncharges or allegations of misconduct, Left by mutual agreement following notice of \nunsatisfactory performance.\u201d For the period from December 2016 to December 2017 \nApplicant stated that he had been unemployed. In fact, Applicant had been employed \nfrom March 2017 to June 2017 and had been fired from the position for poor work \nperformance. This was also a false answer to a relevant question about Applicant\u2019s work \nhistory. \nIn his Answer Applicant stated about his false answer to the employment question, \n\u201cI admit to incorrectly answering the question, subsequently leaving out a period of \nemployment.\u201d Applicant testified about this answer, \u201cI believe I just blanked on the dates \nbecause those dates are in fact on my resume (Applicant Exhibit A) so I did not \nintentionally leave them out.\u201d Applicant also testified that he was told he would be fired \nbecause he was a poor performer. Finally, he stated, \u201cI mean, it was only a short period \nof time and this was several years ago.\u201d (Tr. 26, 33, 39-40.) \nIt is noted that Section 13C \u2013 Employment Record of the e-QIP specifically states, \n\u201cHave any of the following happened to you in the last seven (7) years at employment \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactivities that you have not previously listed?

One of the reasons stated \nis, \u201cFired from a job.\u201d Applicant also answered this question, \u201cNO.\u201d \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted two laudatory letters of recommendation. The writers state \nApplicant is a trustworthy individual. (Applicant Exhibit B.) \nApplicant has received positive evaluations for his current employment. (Applicant \nExhibit C at 3-6.) \nApplicant served in the Marine Corps from 2004 to 2010. He received an \nHonorable Discharge. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Applicant Exhibits B and F; \nTr. 28-29.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n5 \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national\nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under\nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security\nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was alleged to owe approximately $31,000 in past-due and charged-off \ncommercial debts as of the date the SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie \nsupport for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has made strides in resolving his past-due indebtedness. Applicant \nbegan to resolve the debts in 2017, when he regained employment after a long period of \nunemployment and before receiving the SOR. Mitigating Condition (MC) \u00b6 20(a) has \napplication. \nApplicant testified that the majority of these debts occurred during his period of \nunemployment. Once he regained full-time employment Applicant began to resolve them. \nHe acted responsibly under the circumstances. MC \u00b6 20(b) has application. \nMC \u00b6 20(c) has partial application. There is evidence that the problem is being \nresolved and is under control, as further described below. \nMC \u00b6 20(d) has application. Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors. He has already paid out a large amount of money, and fully resolved \nfour of the nine debts listed in the SOR, including the largest debt. Applicant has also \nresolved several other delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR. As the DOHA Appeal \nBoard has stated, \u201cAn applicant is not required to show that she has completely paid off \nher indebtedness, only that she has established a reasonable plan to resolve her debts \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand has taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, \n2006)).) Applicant has done so in this case. \nConsidering all the facts in this case, and after applying both the Disqualifying and \nMitigating Conditions, I find that Applicant has sufficiently mitigated his financial issues. I \nhave considered the fact that Applicant was dilatory in paying these debts. Under the \nparticular facts of this case, his current record of payments has mitigated that fact. \nParagraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe following disqualifying condition is applicable under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP contained incorrect information concerning his finances and his \nemployment record. The record is clear that Applicant knew of the delinquent debts, and \nthat he had been fired from employment in 2017. The stated disqualifying condition \napplies to the facts of this case because of those omissions. \nThe following conditions are potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nTurning first to the financial question, Applicant\u2019s argument is that he misread the \nquestion or read it too fast. The question is straight-forward, and Applicant was certainly \nknowledgeable he had bad debts in 2020 because he was paying them off in 2019 and \n2020. His explanation is insufficient to support his argument that this was a mistake \ninstead of an intentional act. \nApplicant acting intentionally in falsifying his questionnaire is also shown by his \nconduct in answering the relevant question about his employment record. The \nquestionnaire asks applicants twice about whether they had been fired, once in Section \n13A, which goes back ten years. Then, just to make sure, Section 13C specifically asks \nabout leaving a job within seven years under adverse conditions. His termination occurred \nthree years before filling out the questionnaire. Once again, his explanation is insufficient \nto support his argument that this was a mistake and not an intentional act. \nBased on the foregoing I cannot find that Applicant mitigated the allegations under \nthis guideline. Guideline E is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has successfully \nmitigated the concerns regarding his financial situation. He did not mitigate the personal \nconduct concerns. He has not demonstrated rehabilitation and the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, or duress has not been mitigated. Overall, the record evidence does create \ndoubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate financial considerations concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information \nor to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 7, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 7, 2020, and elected to have her \ncase decided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

(Item 6). \nAbsent documentation from Applicant of her implementing her approved student \nloan consolidation with monthly payments to establish some payment track record, \nrestoration of her student loans to current status cannot be established. Worth noting, \nApplicant has made no documented progress in addressing her student loan accounts \nsince her accounts were first reported as delinquent in 2017. (Items 4-5) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These AG guidelines must \nbe considered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                       \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n  Financial Considerations \n \n          The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is  \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

But her reported lack of full-time gainful employment \nbetween 2012 and 2020 does not adequately explain her failure to address her student \nloan debts with even minimal payments during these cited periods of reduced income. \nWith so little financial information to work with on the state of her finances during this \nextended period of income reduction, no meaningful extenuation credit can be assigned \nbased on her claims of limited income. \nAfforded opportunities to provide clarification of her financial conditions and \nexplanations of her lack of payment progress on her student loans, Applicant provided \nno persuasive clarifications or explanations for (a) why she allowed her student loan \naccounts to become delinquent; (b) why she has failed to take any documented steps to \naddress her delinquent student loan accounts; and (c) what payments she has made to \ndate in meeting the terms and conditions of her approved consolidated loan \narrangement. For lack of any documented repayment or financial counseling initiatives \nby Applicant, other potentially available mitigating conditions cannot be applied to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. Based on her failure to date to establish a meaningful track record \nof addressing her student loan deficiencies, it is too soon to make safe predictive \nassessments as to whether Applicant can restore her finances to stable levels \nconsistent with minimum requirements for holding a security clearance. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her accrued delinquent student loan debts and her failure to \nsufficiently address them heretofore are otherwise compatible with DoD requirements \nfor holding a security clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for her contributions \nto the defense industry, her employment contributions are not enough at this time to \novercome her accumulated delinquent student loan debts and her lack of a meaningful \ntrack record for dealing with them. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

Each of the substances used by him were \npurchased by him. (Item 3; Item 4; https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/) Two \nof the substances purchased (Adderall\u00ae and Xanax\u00ae) were prescription drugs for which \nApplicant had no prescription. (Item 4) \nHis introduction to drug involvement and substance misuse regarding marijuana \nwas initially due to peer pressure and wanting to be considered \u201ccool.\u201d During his teen \nyears, he enjoyed the intoxicating effects. As an adult, it helped with boredom in his spare \ntime and enhanced his mood. It also had a calming effect and increased his appetite. The \nrelationships with the other substances began as experiments and produced a variety of \neffects. The hallucinogenic substances led to immediate intoxication, dissociation, \nhallucinations, pseudo-religious experiences, connectivity, and fits of laughter. The \nstimulants, used as an alternative to cocaine to enable him to keep partying, caused \neuphoria, mild hallucinations, stimulation, fast speech, increased heart rate, and positive \nneurotransmitters, accompanied by a hang-over and feeling awful the following day. It \nalso negated the need to sleep. The cocaine caused stimulation, increased socialization, \nand negated the effects of alcohol. It also caused severe nausea. The depressants led to \nlethargy, memory loss, and reduced muscle pain, and they were used to supplement \nopiates during his withdrawal from heroin. The heroin caused lethargy, euphoria, and \nnausea, and such use helped him deal with an abusive relationship. He became addicted \nto heroin. (Item 4) \nApplicant was aware that most of the substances he used were illegal, but that his \nmarijuana use, while prohibited federally, was legal in the states where he used it. He \nclaimed, that with the exception of marijuana, he repeatedly attempted to stop using the \nother substances because of their increasingly unpleasant effects on him, as well as his \ndesire to eventually apply for a government job. His first major effort to permanently \nremove \u201cserious drugs,\u201d identified by him as heroin, methamphetamine, and crack \ncocaine, from his life occurred in 2013 when he relocated from one university to another, \nand \u201ckicked\u201d his opiate dependency. After four or five instances, he relapsed and resumed \nhis use of those substances. A year or two later, he started using \u201cparty drugs,\u201d identified \nby him as cocaine and Ecstasy, in addition to LSD, with new friends. In 2015, upon being \naccepted into a graduate program, he resolved to stop using \u201cparty drugs,\u201d though he \nwas, again, not completely successful. (Item 4) \nHe claimed to have no future intentions to distribute any of the substances. He \nalso claimed that with the possible exception of marijuana, he would not use any of the \nother substances in the future. The exception for marijuana was reported by him as \n\u201cpossible\u201d future intentions based on the following conditions: if he is not in a position of \nnational trust, working for the U.S. Government, and if he is doing so legally.

In May 2007, while parked in his vehicle with friends, he was detained by campus \npolice for consuming alcohol (while under age) and smoking marijuana. He was charged, \nhandcuffed, and released to his parents. He appeared in court in June 2007 and was \nfined, ordered to perform community service, and required to participate in court-ordered \ncounseling. In May 2008, he was stopped for speeding by the police and charged with \ndriving under the influence (DUI) and use and possession of a controlled substance \n(marijuana). He appeared in court in June 2008 and was fined, required to perform \ncommunity service, and ordered to continue his substance abuse counseling. In October \n2008, he was charged with use and possession of marijuana. The disposition of the \ncharges was not reported. In June 2013, while visiting a European country, Applicant \npurchased an unspecified quantity of heroin from a local drug dealer. The police \nconfronted them, and Applicant was searched and found to be in possession of the heroin. \nHe was brought to the central booking station and strip searched. He was released by the \npolice when he informed them that he was leaving the country within 48 hours. (Item 4) \nHe participated in court-ordered counseling and treatment at a behavioral \ncounseling center between August 2008 and August 2009. The specifics of the program \nwere not reported. While he had no other drug treatment or counseling, when he felt that \nhe was slipping into addiction, and in moments of struggle to get clean, or he needed a \nsupport group to do so, following a relapse, he claimed he would turn to Alcohol \nAnonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA). (Item 4) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including. . . purchase. . . ; \nand \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational multi-substance abuser of a variety of \nSchedule I, II, IIN, and IV Controlled Substances. He frequently purchased and used all \nof those substances for over an 18-year period, until January 2021. He recently noted \nthat with the possible exception of marijuana, he would not use any of the other \nsubstances in the future. The exception for future marijuana use was reported by him as \n\u201cpossible\u201d future intentions based on the following conditions: if he is not in a position of \nnational trust, working for the U.S. Government, and if he is doing so legally. His \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexpressed conditions regarding future marijuana use fails to clearly and convincingly \ncommit himself to discontinue such misuse. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) have been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. After approximately 18 years of regular \nmulti-substance drug involvement and substance misuse involving \u201cserious drugs\u201d and \n\u201cparty drugs,\u201d with several relapses, and police and court interventions, Applicant \ncontinued using marijuana as recently as January 2021, a little less than one year ago. \nHe was open about his use of the illegal substances when he completed his SF 86, and \nfor that candor, he is given credit. He acknowledged his drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, but he offered no substantial evidence of actions taken to overcome those issues, \nsuch as exploring drug treatment and therapy more recently than his court-mandated \ncounseling ending in 2009; changing or avoiding the environment where marijuana was \nused, especially when he left university campuses for the corporate world, or overseas, \nwhere he continued his drug involvement; providing a signed statement of intent to \nabstain from --\nall drug involvement and substance misuse, without any conditions; or \nevidence to support his claimed abstinence since January 2021. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history of \napproximately 18 years of multi-substance use and misuse, the relatively brief period of \na little less than one year of reported abstinence is considered insufficient to conclude \nthat the abstinence will continue, especially after he admitted numerous relapses in the \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npast. Applicant\u2019s claimed new compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, is in stark \ncontrast to his cavalier attitude towards those same laws, rules, and regulations. His use \nof all of the identified substances, and misuse of the prescription drugs (without \npossessing a prescription for the drugs), despite knowing that such use was prohibited \nby both the Federal Government and, in most cases, with the state laws (with the \nexception of marijuana which was legal in some of the states where he used it), and his \ncontinued use of marijuana, until recently, to completely disavow future marijuana use \nwithout possible conditions, continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 33-year-old \nprospective employee of a defense contractor. He was sponsored for an unidentified \nposition in July 2019, but because of delays in the processing of his background \ninvestigation, while \u201ctechnically employed\u201d by the defense contractor, he has not been \ngiven a specific position. In February 2020, while awaiting the conclusion of his \nbackground investigation, he obtained temporary employment as a data entry operator \nwith a staffing agency. A 2007 high school graduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2013 and a master\u2019s degree in 2018. When completing his SF 86, he was candid in \nacknowledging that he had used a variety of illegal substances. He now claims that, with \nthe possible exception of marijuana, he will abstain from all illegal drug behavior, drug \ninvolvement, and substance misuse.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational multi-substance abuser. Because of his drug \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \ninvolvement and substance misuse, he had police or court interventions on at least three \noccasions, including once while overseas. Although he was required to attend drug \ncounseling on two of those occasions during 2008 and 2009, he continued his drug \ninvolvement moving from what he called \u201cserious drugs\u201d to \u201dparty drugs\u201d without any \nconsideration of the illegal actions in which he was participating. Despite attempting to \nend his relationship with illegal substances, he was unsuccessful and went through \nrepeated relapses. He finally stopped using marijuana in January 2021, a little less than \none year ago. He has not explored any possible drug therapy or counseling since he left \nthe court-mandated counseling in 2009. His expressed conditions regarding future \nmarijuana use fail to clearly and convincingly commit himself to discontinue such misuse. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.o.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to all of the SOR allegations, his testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 48 years old. He has two adult children from his first marriage in 1991. He was divorced in 2003. He remarried in 2009 and has one adult stepchild. He and his wife live in a home he has owned since 2007. He earned his high school diploma in 1991 and an associate\u2019s degree from a technical institute in 1996. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy following his high school graduation and served for four year. He was honorably discharged in 1995 at the pay grade of E-3. He presently works as an avionics tech for a DoD contractor. His wife works in a warehouse. (Tr. at 18-22, 32.) In connection with his employment with DoD Contractor I, Applicant applied for and was granted eligibility for a secret security clearance in 2016. He changed jobs to work for DoD Contractor II in 2017. His current employer asked him to apply for a top secret clearance. He submitted his SCA in November 2017. (Tr. at 7-8, 21-22.)

The DoD CAF acted \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective within DoD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn December 23, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (Answer). He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). On March 4, 2021, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a Notice \nof Hearing on April 13, 2021, scheduling the hearing for June 7, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented seven \nproposed exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. I marked \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit I. In the absence of any objections, \nI admitted the Government\u2019s exhibits into the record. (Tr. at 8-13.) \nApplicant offered no documentary evidence at the hearing. He also did not request \nadditional time to submit exhibits after the hearing. The record closed at the conclusion \nof the hearing. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to all of the SOR \nallegations, his testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He has two adult children from his first marriage in 1991. \nHe was divorced in 2003. He remarried in 2009 and has one adult stepchild. He and his \nwife live in a home he has owned since 2007. He earned his high school diploma in 1991 \nand an associate\u2019s degree from a technical institute in 1996. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy \nfollowing his high school graduation and served for four year. He was honorably \ndischarged in 1995 at the pay grade of E-3. He presently works as an avionics tech for a \nDoD contractor. His wife works in a warehouse. (Tr. at 18-22, 32.) \nIn connection with his employment with DoD Contractor I, Applicant applied for and \nwas granted eligibility for a secret security clearance in 2016. He changed jobs to work \nfor DoD Contractor II in 2017. His current employer asked him to apply for a top secret \nclearance. He submitted his SCA in November 2017. (Tr. at 7-8, 21-22.) \nIn November 2015, Applicant began to experience financial problems after he was \nfired from his job at Employer A. He was terminated for violating company policies \nregarding computer usage. Employer A paid him a substantial hourly rate, and he was \ngiven a significant amount of overtime while working there. As a result, his annual income \nas an electrician was about $120,000 for about five years. He earned substantially less \nat his next two jobs, Employer B and DoD Contractor I. When he moved from Employer \nB to DOD Contractor I, his earnings increased to about $50,000 per year. He is presently \nmaking about $75,000 per year working at DoD Contactor II. While working at Employer \nA, he incurred significant credit-card debts and other debts, even though he made a good \nincome working there. He testified that he ran up debts on the five bank credit cards that \nare the subject of the SOR allegations and another three cards that he paid off prior to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe issuance of the SOR. In addition, he incurred debts on three retail store cards. (Tr. at \n10-11, 22-30, 40-42.) \nAfter losing his job with Employer A and suffering a large reduction in his income, \nApplicant was unable to continue paying his debts. He defaulted on all of the SOR debts. \nHe also had a vehicle repossessed. All of his credit cards were cancelled and turned over \nto collection agencies. He was able to avoid foreclosure on his home mortgage, though \nhe got behind on his mortgage payments. He subsequently caught up and is now current \non his mortgage. He has cut back on his expenses to avoid incurring any new debt. (Tr. \nat 30-45, 49.) \nApplicant has not created a budget. He is hoping to negotiate lower amounts on \nhis debts so that he can begin to repay them. Some of the collection agencies have sent \nhim settlement plans. He would like to make better deals with his creditors. He is trying \nto avoid filing for bankruptcy. He currently has about $10,000 in savings and about \n$25,000 in his employer\u2019s retirement plan. He has taken out a loan on the funds in the \nretirement account to pay for car repairs. He has worked hard to avoid creating new \nfinancial problems and intends to repay his debts as best as he can when he can in the \nfuture. (Tr. at 30-45, 49.) \nSOR Debts \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the following eight debts alleged in the \nSOR: \n1.a Credit-Card Account Charged Off in the Amount of $3,383. Applicant opened this \naccount in 2006. His last payment was made in about 2016. The creditor charged off this \ndebt. Applicant has made no further payments. This debt is not resolved.

Applicant has made no \nfurther payments. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 32; GE 4 at 6; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 3: \nGE 7 at 4.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR Answer and testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(e): consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Three of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are current, likely to recur, and cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He suffered a financial setback with his \ntermination from Employer A in 2015. The termination was due to his violation of the \ncompany\u2019s policies, so the resulting financial problems cannot be viewed as having \nresulted from conditions largely beyond his control. Also, he has not acted responsibly \nsince 2015 by contacting his creditors and developing plans to repay his debts over time, \nwhether all at the same time or one at a time. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant still \nhad not initiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors. None of the above \nmitigating conditions have been established. \nApplicant has not taken any significant steps to address his delinquent debts. In \nlight of the record as a whole, Applicant failed to carry his burden to establish mitigation \nof the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Additional comments are warranted. \nApplicant accumulated a significant amount of debt during the years when he earned the \nmost income working at Employer A. Since he began working for DoD Contractor II in \n2017 and started to regain a good portion of his prior income, he has taken no steps to \nseek counseling to help him develop a plan to repay his debts. At that time, he had already \nbeen granted a secret security clearance. His failure to take any actions on his debt \nevidences a lack of responsibility inconsistent with the requirements for eligibility for \naccess to classified information. After weighing the applicable disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his indebtedness. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 39 years old. He married in 2011, and has one child and a stepchild. Since March 2020, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. His job title is computer operator. (Item 5.) The SOR alleged under Guideline F that Applicant has nine delinquent debts totaling over $58,000. One of the allegations is for his delinquent student loans and it is the majority of his total debt ($47,628). (Item 1.) Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.i. He also admitted that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2014, which was discharged in July 2014. (SOR \u00b6 1.j) He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 7, 2020. The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 4, 20211, detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The DOD \nCAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines, effective within the DOD as of June 8, 2017. \n1 Note that the date reflected on the SOR reads January 4, 2020, but the digital signature reflected the actual date of \nJanuary 4, 2021. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 11, 2021, and elected a decision on the \nwritten record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On February 11, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 10 (Items). \nApplicant was sent the FORM on February 12, 2021, and he received the FORM on \nMarch 1, 2021. He was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not respond to the \nFORM or submit any documentation. The SOR and the answer (Items 1 and 2) are the \npleadings in the case. Items 3 through 10 are admitted without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on May 17, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 39 years old. He married in 2011, and has one child and a stepchild. \nSince March 2020, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. His job title is \ncomputer operator. (Item 5.) \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline F that Applicant has nine delinquent debts \ntotaling over $58,000. One of the allegations is for his delinquent student loans and it is \nthe majority of his total debt ($47,628). (Item 1.) Applicant admitted the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.i. He also admitted that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March \n2014, which was discharged in July 2014. (SOR \u00b6 1.j) He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, \n1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. (Item 2) He provided an explanation for his financial problems as follows: \n\u201cMy financial hardships started in 2013. My wife had our son in November \n2012, and it triggered her thyroid and caused her to have Graves\u2019 disease. \nShe was unable to work for the next two years due to the surgical removal \nof her thyroid and gallbladder. I had the only income in our household which \ncaused a snowball effect of late payments and eventually bankruptcy. My \nwife started working again in August 2016 and is now the only income until \nI start working for [employer]. Currently, I am the only source of income \nwhile my wife is recovering from substance abuse. Please consider my \nhardships and I hope you will understand that I need to be granted \nclearance to start work so I can help financially.\u201d (Item 5 pg. 39)  \nThe Government does not contest or rebut Applicant\u2019s explanation for his financial \nissues. (FORM.) His SOR delinquencies began in 2013, and they persist to this day. His \nChapter 7 bankruptcy Schedule F (Unsecured Nonpriority Claims) listed debts totaling \n$71,561. With the exception of his student loans, a majority of these debts were \ndischarged in July 2014. Although Applicant denied several debts, he failed to provide \nany supporting documentation to show that the debts had been resolved, in the process \nof being settled, or that he had a legitimate basis to dispute the debts. He also failed to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovide documentation to show what efforts, if any, he has taken to resolve the three \ndebts he admitted in his SOR response. (Items 7, 8 and 9.) \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline E that Applicant deliberately falsified material \nfacts on his April 2020 SCA in response to a listed employment. The question read: \u201cFor \nthis employment have any of the following happened to you in the last seven (7) years: \nyou were fired; quit after being told you would be fired; left by mutual agreement following \ncharges of misconduct; or you left employment by mutual agreement following notice of \nunsatisfactory performance? Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d and intentionally failed to disclose \nthat he had been terminated in March 2018 by his employer for falsifying his time cards. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) In June 2020, during his background interview, Applicant continued to deny \nthat he had been fired or was involved in any type of misconduct at the time he left this \nemployment. The employer provided a written account stating that Applicant was fired \nafter a week-long investigation revealed he repeatedly misconduct for falsified his time \ncards. The employment termination for falsifying time cards is also separately alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted that he falsified his time cards, was \nterminated from his employment, and then falsified his SCA. (Items 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10) \nThe SOR also alleged that in August 2016, Applicant was terminated by his then \nemployer for unauthorized personal use of a company vehicle. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) Applicant \ndisclosed his 2016 employment termination on the SCA. (Items 1, 2, 6 and 10) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR indebtedness started in at least 2013, and it continues to present. \nHis financial problems are ongoing despite his July 2014 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. There is nothing in the record showing that Applicant has \ninitiated and is making efforts to resolve his overdue debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nIt is undisputed that Applicant\u2019s indebtedness was caused, in part, by his wife\u2019s \nserious health conditions and unemployment, which were conditions beyond his control. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. The next inquiry, however, is whether Applicant \nacted responsibly under the adverse circumstances he was facing. There is nothing in \nthe record showing that Applicant made any efforts to address his overdue debts. I cannot \nfind that the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Therefore, I find against Applicant on \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nnational security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nApplicant was terminated by his employer in March 2018 for falsifying his time \ncards. He intentionally did not disclose this employment termination on his April 2020 \nSCA, as required. He was also terminated from employment in August 2016 for \nunauthorized personal use of a company vehicle. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(c) are established.   \nAG \u00b6 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nApplicant admitted falsifying his 2020 SCA. He also admitted his two recent job \nterminations by employers for cause. His intentional omission, which casts doubt on his \nreliability and trustworthiness, and his employment misconduct on two separate \noccasions are recent, serious, and may recur in the future. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline E and the AG \u00b6 2(d) \nfactors in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations and the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. He leaves me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United \nStates to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has a history of using illegal drugs. She has used marijuana on almost a \ndaily basis since 2014. Applicant stated that she intends to continue to use marijuana \nsince its use has helped her manage stress and anxiety. All three of the disqualifying \nconditions apply, thereby transferring the burden to Applicant to mitigate them. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant admitted her long-term use of marijuana and her intent to continue its \nuse. She argued that the Federal government\u2019s proscription is wrong and that granting \nher a clearance would be appropriate. The problem with Applicant\u2019s argument is that the \nrules still apply and consistent marijuana use is viewed as being inconsistent with national \nsecurity eligibility. (See Center for Development of Security Excellence, Memorandum \nfrom Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence dated November 17, 2014, \nhttps://www.cdse.edu/documents/toolkits-psa/Adherence-to-Federal-Laws-Prohibiting-\nMarijuana-Use.pdf (last accessed July 15, 2021).) None of the mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant\u2019s use. Applicant has not met her burden of persuasion to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from her lengthy history of drug involvement at this time. This allegation \nis found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns resulting from her long-term drug involvement. Overall, the record \nevidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

On March 11, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On March 16, \n2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. \nOn April 15, 2021, DOHA issued a notice of DCS video teleconference hearing \nscheduling the hearing for June 8, 2021.

I held the record open until June 25, 2021, to afford the Applicant an \nopportunity to submit additional evidence. Applicant through counsel timely submitted \nAE 7, which was admitted without objection. On June 16, 2021, DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.). \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, through counsel, admitted in part and denied in part the three SOR \nallegations with explanations. (SOR Answer) His partial admissions are incorporated or \nadopted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow. \nBackground Information \nApplicant is a 39-year-old senior principal engineer - electrical employed by a \ndefense contractor since March 2020. (SOR Answer (Ex. 1); GE 1; Tr. 14-15, 38) He \nseeks a security clearance to enhance his position within his company. (GE 1; Tr. 15-\n16, 38-39) Applicant was previously employed by his current employer and held a \nclearance from 2007 to 2013. (SOR Answer (Ex. 1); GE 2 - June 10, 2020 Office of \nPersonnel Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI); Tr. 17) \nApplicant received his high school diploma in June 2000. He was awarded a \nBachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering with a minor in electrical \nengineering in June 2004, and graduated magna cum laude with a 3.84 grade point \naverage. (SOR Answer (Ex. 1); GE 1; Tr. 16, 37-38) Applicant married in March 2016, \nand has no children. (GE 1; Tr. 16-17)  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant self-reported drug use on his April 22, 2020 SF-86 when reapplying for \na security clearance for reemployment with his current defense contractor. (GE 1; 36-\n37) He was subsequently interviewed on June 10, 2020 by an OPM investigator \nregarding his drug use. None of his drug use occurred while holding a security \nclearance or occurred anticipating renewal of a security clearance. (GE 2) He \nelaborated on his drug use in his January 11, 2021 SOR Answer as well as during his \ntestimony. The following summarizes that drug use. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that from approximately September 2015 to October 2019, \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency. In his SOR Answer, Applicant \nadmitted to using marijuana five times in the past seven years and disputed the \ncharacterization of \u201cvarying frequency.\u201d He noted that over the past several years, the \nlegal restrictions on recreational use of marijuana have eased significantly, with \nnumerous states decriminalizing marijuana entirely. (SOR Answer) During his \ntestimony, Applicant confirmed the number of times he used marijuana as admitted in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nhis SOR Answer adding that his marijuana use occurred in 2015 and from 2016 to 2019 \nat music/art festivals. (Tr. 39-40, 45--55) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that from approximately September 2015 to October 2019, \nApplicant used LSD with varying frequency. In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted to \nusing LSD two times, once in September 2015 and once in October 2019. Applicant \nwanted to clarify that these two uses did not constitute \u201ccontinued use and/or abuse\u201d \nand were experimental, while attending music/art festivals. (SOR Answer; Tr. 45) During \nhis testimony, Applicant confirmed the number of times he used LSD as admitted in his \nSOR Answer. (Tr. 39-40, 45-55) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged that in approximately October 2019, Applicant used MDMA \n(\u201cecstasy\u201d). In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted to using MDMA once in October \n2019 at a music/art festival. (SOR Answer) During his testimony, Applicant confirmed \nthe number of times he used MDMA in his SOR Answer. (Tr. 39-40, 45-55) \nApplicant explained his use of drugs during this timeframe was \u201ca spiritual event, \nit was opening my mind to different experiences, different viewpoints, it was a way of \nconnecting with others there, it was a different way to experience the music and art.\u201d \n(Tr. 40, 52-53) He was not working for a defense contractor nor did he have a security \nclearance at any time that he used these drugs. Applicant understands that use of drugs \nwhen he did not have a security clearance was illegal, but \u201cit felt like a low risk at the \ntime. I realize now it was a mistake. . .\u201d This experience has impressed on Applicant \nthat drug use is not acceptable and that youthful experimentation is viewed quite \ndifferently as an adult. (Tr. 40, 48-49, 57-58) \nApplicant credibly stated that he disclosed all of his drug use on his SF-86. (Tr. \n42-43) He understands that any form of drug use is not permitted under federal law and \nas such, he will comply with the law. (Tr. 55-56) Applicant\u2019s wife is aware of his past \ndrug use and fully supports him maintaining sobriety. (Tr. 61) \nApplicant noted that the process to obtain a clearance has definitely affected his \nmotivation regarding any future drug use. He stated, \u201cI will not be using drugs in the \nfuture.\u201d (Tr. 43) Applicant\u2019s motivation to obtain a security clearance is, \u201cI do love the \njob. I like working with [described project] very much, and it would enable me to better \nhelp my company and the customer, the Navy or the Government.\u201d (Tr. 44) He \nrequested the hearing because, \u201cI want to convince the Judge and the Government that \nI am trustworthy and can safely hold a security clearance.\u201d (Tr. 44) \nApplicant described time spent with individuals that he used drugs with in the \npast as varying and dependent on the individual. Some individuals he sees annually or \nless, and some individuals he sees on a more frequent basis, but does not use drugs \nwith them. These individuals understand and respect the fact that Applicant\u2019s current \nemployment does not allow him to use drugs. Applicant regrets his prior drug use and \nacknowledged that using drugs in his profession was \u201cnot smart.\u201d (Tr. 55, 58-60) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted two negative drug tests dated February 9, 2021, and March \n29, 2021.

He added that it is his intention to abstain \ncompletely from all intoxicating substance abuse, including, but not limited to \ndisassociation from events and people that promote the usage of illegal intoxicants and \navoidance of drug-using associates and/or contacts. (AE 7) \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant called two character witnesses to testify on his behalf: \n \nCo-worker (CW-1) and mechanical engineer. CW-1 has known Applicant since \n2008 when he hired on as a new employee with their present employer. CW-1 \ndescribed Applicant as a \u201cvery approachable, technically capable individual.\u201d He further \nstated that Applicant was cognizant of balancing the competing interests of \nmanagement and the customer making \u201cthe correct decision for both the customer and \nthe company\u2019s sake.\u201d CW-1 reached out to Applicant to return to their company \nbecause of his expertise in key areas. CW-1 never observed Applicant drink to excess \nor use drugs. CW-1 is aware of Applicant\u2019s admitted drug use and the Government\u2019s \nconcerns. Based on observing Applicant on a personal and professional basis, CW-1 \nstated that Applicant is a person of \u201cvery good character\u201d who could be trusted to \nsafeguard classified information. CW-1 also submitted a reference letter on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf. (AE 6; Tr. 17-27) \n \nCo-worker (CW-2) and mechanical engineer. CW-2 has known Applicant since \nthe \u201cmid 2000s when he joined the group and we worked on production equipment \ntogether.\u201d CW-2 described Applicant as a \u201cvery bright individual . . . willing to wade into \ncomplex situations and sort them out . . . .\u201d Applicant was well liked and trusted by his \npeers and management. CW-2 added that Applicant was good-natured, punctual, and \nhandled stress very well. CW-2 is aware of Applicant\u2019s admitted drug use and the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns. CW-2 never observed Applicant drink to excess. CW-2 stated \nApplicant is a valued and trusted employee and does not pose a security risk.

(SOR \nAnswer; AE. 2, AE 3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides one condition that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \nThese proceedings were initiated after Applicant self-reported his history of drug \nuse on his April 22, 2020 SF-86, and later during his June 10, 2020 OPM PSI. These \nself-disclosures establish AG \u00b6 25(a). Further review is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists two conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find application of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) (1)(2)(3). \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd.

Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board\nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use\nfor five years prior to the hearing.

His drug use \noccurred while attending music/art festivals with friends where it was common to \nexperiment with mood-altering substances, in order to increase visual and audio \nstimulation and to be more interpersonally connected with other festival attendees. \nApplicant clarified that his drug use was infrequent and limited to these venues. He has \nengaged in a significant amount of self-reflection regarding his behavior and recognizes \nthat such behavior is incompatible with holding a security clearance. Applicant has \ncommitted, as noted in his post-hearing statement of intent, to disassociating from \nevents and people that promote the usage of illegal intoxicants and avoiding drug-using \nassociates and contacts. \nThe record contains persuasive evidence that Applicant has turned the corner on \nachieving drug abstinence. He recognizes the importance of being a responsible \nhusband and colleague, and that his actions can affect others. He also fully recognizes \nthat there is no room for any drug use while holding a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nself-reflection, change in behavior, and support from his family, friends, and associates, \nnot to mention 18 months of sobriety, are indicative of an individual who wants to right \nhis course. The absence of evidence of more recent or extensive drug use, and his \npromise not to use illegal drugs in the future, eliminates doubts about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to abstaining from illegal \ndrug use. In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board \nreversed an unfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge \nfailed to explain why drug use was not mitigated after the passage of more than six \nyears from the previous drug abuse. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists three ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has maintained a drug-free environment, achieved \nongoing personal growth, and changed his own life with respect to drug use. He does \nnot associate with anyone who uses marijuana and made lifestyle changes consistent \nwith sobriety. He has abstained from drug use for about 18 months and has had no \nproblem in doing so. \nApplicant\u2019s letters of support from his wife, friends, and colleagues document that \nhe is an individual who possesses character and integrity. Applicant\u2019s work performance \nevaluations reflect the caliber of the contribution he is making as an employee. His \nperformance further reflects his work behavior is not indicative of someone with a drug \nproblem. As an employee and as a member of his community, he is viewed as reliable, \na constant learner, and an individual with integrity. At his hearing, Applicant \nacknowledged that future drug abuse is incompatible with his future career and family \nplans, and manifested a steadfast commitment to continue lifestyle changes consistent \nwith total abstinence of involvement with all other illegal drugs. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility, I did so after assessing his demeanor, overall \ncandor on other matters, and reputation among his superiors and peers. Given the \ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s background, his explanation for his actions, and his \nsubsequent actions, I find credible his assertion that he will not use any illegal \nsubstance in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. Drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guideline H is incorporated \nin this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant has been and is willing to maintain conduct expected of one entrusted \nwith a security clearance. He self-reported his drug use knowing that such disclosure \ncould jeopardize his clearance eligibility. I note that his drug use did not occur while he \nheld a clearance. Applicant\u2019s drug use occurred infrequently at music/art festivals at \nevents where a misplaced acceptance of normalcy was created by his peer group and \nenvironment. He has since recognized that it is not prudent to place himself in such an \nenvironment. \nApplicant\u2019s employer, friends, and family support him. He has a history of stable \nemployment and a strong work ethic. This level of support and self-introspection should \nensure his continued success. Applicant demonstrated the correct attitude and \ncommitment to remaining drug free. He has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, \nresponsible, and trustworthy person. He was serious, candid, and credible at the \nhearing. He appears to have cooperated fully and provided truthful information during \nthe security clearance process and during his OPM PSI. He made a good impression on \nme during the hearing. I believe Applicant has learned from this experience, and is \ncommitted to remaining drug-free. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Applicant provided no documentation to support \na specific plan for resolving his financial issues. He did not dispute any of the debts. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \nand 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted, and his credit report confirms, that he is responsible for the \ndelinquent debts. He did not report circumstances beyond his control, and he has not \nacted responsibly. He has had the delinquent debts for several years. He has not \npresented any financial arrangement agreements. He has received no financial \ncounseling. He has not provided any documentation that supports any of the mitigating \nconditions. His tactic of waiting for settlement for half the amount of the debts is not \nreliable. \nBased on the lack of evidence produced by Applicant, it is difficult to conclude he \nmade a sufficient good-faith effort to resolve any debts, or that his financial situation is \nunder control. Despite gainful employment, there is no evidence that Applicant has a \nmeaningful track record of financial responsibility in this case. He has not met his \nburden and none of the mitigating conditions apply. He does not have the good \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment or reliability needed for a security clearance. Any doubts must be resolved in \nfavor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Because protection of the interests of \nnational security is the principal focus of this decision, any remaining doubts must be \nresolved by denying eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Her \nhearing was held as scheduled in the vicinity of Arlington, Virginia using the U.S. Cyber \nCommand video teleconference system. (Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant offered \none exhibit; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence.

She indicated she intended to cease using marijuana once her \nsecurity clearance is approved. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that she used marijuana in June 2020 \nand August 2020 after she completed her SCA on May 16, 2020. \nIn 2013, after Applicant graduated from college, she used marijuana on two \noccasions. (Tr. 20-21) She said the next time she used marijuana was in April of 2018. \n(Tr. 22) \nIn her May 16, 2020 SCA, Applicant said she answered yes to the question about \nillegal drug use \u201cdue to federal regulations around THC/marijuana,\u201d which is an indication \nshe was aware of the federal restrictions on marijuana use. She said in her SCA that her \nmost recent marijuana involvement was in March 2020. (GE 1 at 40) Elsewhere in her \nMay 16, 2020 SCA, she said her most recent marijuana use was around November 2019. \n(Id. at 39) She explained her frequency of marijuana use was \u201capproximately 10-20 times \nthrough the years,\u201d and she explained as follows: \u201cI have never purchased marijuana \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noutside state-sanctioned THC/marijuana dispensaries.

(Id. at \n39-40) On July 17, 2020, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \nreviewed her SCA responses relating to the recency and frequency of her marijuana use, \nand Applicant agreed she made these responses on her SCA. (GE 2 at 6) \nAt her hearing, Applicant said when she used marijuana after completion of her \nSCA, she believed her marijuana use was not prohibited for security reasons because it \nwas not illegal under state law. (Tr. 24) In June and August of 2020, she used marijuana \nin a state where marijuana use is legal. (Tr. 23) In her response to DOHA interrogatories \non December 11, 2020, she said her most recent marijuana use was on August 8, 2020. \n(GE 2 at 10) At her hearing, she said she did not use marijuana after August 2020. (Tr. \n24) \nOn September 25, 2018, Applicant provided a urine sample for a substance-use \nevaluation, and a laboratory detected 27 ng/ml of the marijuana or Delta-9-THC-COOH \nmetabolite in her urine sample. (Tr. 26; GE 3) Applicant\u2019s October 9, 2018 substance-use \nevaluation indicates Applicant made a self-report to the evaluator that her most recent \nmarijuana use was on September 1, 2018. (GE 4 at 19) \nAt her hearing, Applicant said she used marijuana for medical reasons. (Tr. 38) \nShe ended her marijuana use in August 2020, and now she takes vitamins and uses \nexercise to alleviate her cramps and pain. (Tr. 38-39) She promised not to use marijuana \nin the future. (Tr. 39) \nApplicant\u2019s husband continues to use marijuana, and she associates with him. (Tr. \n28) She said that he purchases a single marijuana joint at a time, and he does not have \nany remaining marijuana stored in their house. (Tr. 33)  \nAlcohol Consumption \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges in August 2018, Applicant was arrested for driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol (DUI). Her breathalyzer test result was a blood alcohol content (BAC) \nof .193. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges in September 2018, a chemical dependency professional \nevaluated Applicant and diagnosed her with alcohol abuse, uncomplicated. \nIn August 2018, Applicant and her husband consumed several drinks in a bar. (Tr. \n25) Applicant said she consumed four to six drinks of whiskey over about three hours. \n(Tr. 31) She did not indicate the number of ounces of whiskey in the drinks. They walked \nhome from the bar, and Applicant went to sleep for several hours. (Tr. 25, 30) She \nawakened and discovered her husband was not in her residence.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d From about 2013 to August 2020, \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency. She used marijuana in June 2020 and \nAugust 2020 after she completed her SCA on May 16, 2020. She possessed marijuana \nbefore she used it. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c).

Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

My comments under Guidelines H and \nG are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old program manager, who has been working for a defense \ncontractor since April 2018. In 2013, she was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil \nengineering from an Ivy League university, where she had a full scholarship. There is no \nevidence of security violations, improper disclosure of classified information, or that \nApplicant compromised national security. See ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. \nJan. 14, 2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d and commenting that \nsecurity concerns may nevertheless not be mitigated). \nApplicant disclosed her marijuana use on her May 16, 2020 SCA, and during her \nJuly 17, 2020 OPM interview, SOR response, and hearing. An honest and candid self-\nreport of drug abuse is an important indication that, if granted security clearance eligibility, \nthe individual would disclose any threats to national security, even if the disclosure \ninvolves an issue that might damage his or her own career or personal reputation. \nHowever, the mitigating weight of Applicant\u2019s disclosures is undermined by her marijuana \nuse after she completed her SCA and her OPM interview. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

Although he now appears to be in compliance with the \nIRS, his income-tax problems went on for far too many years to justify complete \nmitigation. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non January 23, 2020. (Exhibit 2) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. He was interviewed as part of a background investigation in April \n2020. (Exhibit 3) Thereafter, on December 18, 2020, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.

In a handwritten response, he \nadmitted the sole allegation concerning failure to timely file federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2004-2019. He provided no explanatory information beyond his admission, \nnor did he provide supporting documentation. He requested a decision based on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn January 22, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM), which consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it February 21, 2021. \nHe replied via e-mail on February 25, 2021, and followed up with the same reply via \nU.S. mail received on March 2, 2012. His reply includes supporting documentation \nconsisting of copies of federal income tax records, which are collectively admitted as \nExhibit A. The case was assigned to me on April 6, 2021.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. (Exhibit 2 at Section 25) He is employed as a mechanic for a \ncompany in the defense industry. He has been so employed since January 2020. He \nattended high school during 1986-1990 and obtained a GED in October 1990. He then \nattended technical college during 1991-1992 and obtained a certificate as a welder. He \nhas never married and has no children. \nThe SOR concerns a history of income-tax problems consisting of Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2004-2019. Applicant does \nnot dispute or contest the SOR allegation. He disclosed his income-tax problems when \nhe completed his 2020 security clearance application in which he reported failure to file \nfederal income tax returns for tax years 2011-2018. (Exhibit 2 at Section 26) He \nprovided additional information during the security clearance process. (Exhibit 3) He \nexplained in his security clearance application that his failure to file was due to being \naway at a remote location in Alaska during tax season. \nIn his reply to the FORM, Applicant presented documentary proof that he \nobtained assistance of a tax professional and filed returns with the IRS for tax years \n2012-2020 in about January-February 2021. (Exhibit A) The returns for tax years 2018-\n2020 were filed electronically and the older returns were filed via the U.S. mail. He \nexplained that when he contacted the IRS they requested returns for tax years 2015 \nforward, but he elected to file the additional years (2012-2014) to show that he was due \nrefunds for those years. His representation is consistent with IRS practice and \nprocedure, which provides a general rule that a taxpayer must file six years of back tax \nreturns to be in good standing with the IRS.1 The returns for tax years 2012-2017 show \nthat he overpaid tax and was due a refund for each of those tax years. \n1 IRS Policy Statement 5-133, Delinquent Returns\u2014Enforcement of Filing Requirements. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.2  As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d3  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.4  The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.5  \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6  Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n2  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 484 U.S. at 531. \n5 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n7 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case. \nApplicant is now in compliance with the IRS, which means that he filed all tax \nreturns, as required. His proof of filing is documented in Exhibit A, which shows he filed \nthe returns during January or February 2021. \nIn addressing this issue, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns \nwhen due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the federal \ngovernment. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax when \ndue, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 15, 2017). \nHere, I am concerned about the duration of Applicant\u2019s income-tax problems and \nthe timing of his remedial action. Both are questions of fact that must be addressed. \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for more than a decade. He says \nhe did so because he was away at a remote location during tax season, which does not \nexplain why he did not seek an extension of time or simply filed the returns late upon his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nreturn from the remote location. Although I am persuaded that Applicant was not a tax \nprotestor nor tax defiant, he was exceptionally lax and neglectful.    \nTo his credit, Applicant disclosed his income-tax problems in his 2020 security \nclearance application, and he provided additional information during the security \nclearance process. He finally took remedial action in early 2021, when he filed returns \nfor tax years 2012-2020. His remedial action apparently occurred as a response to the \nsecurity clearance process. He has been in compliance with the IRS for a relatively brief \nperiod of time compared with his time of noncompliance. \nConsidering the totality of facts and circumstances, it is far too soon to tell if he \nwill continue to meet his income-tax obligations on a timely basis. Accordingly, the \nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(g) applies, but the evidence is not sufficient to justify \ncomplete mitigation of his long-standing irresponsibility in failing to meet his legal \nobligations. \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. (Item 2) Applicant is 52 years old. He is married with no children. He served in his state\u2019s Army National Guard from 2004-2011 and was honorably discharged. He has worked as a federal contractor since 2011. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has held a security clearance since at least 2010. (Item 4) Applicant claims he abused the prescription drug Hydrocodone from 2017 to 2020 because he suffers from a medical condition for which he was not receiving proper medical treatment. At the time of his drug abuse, he held a security clearance. He obtained the Hydrocodone from his wife, who has a legal prescription for it. He used the drug intermittently, about three times a month, to manage pain because over-the- counter pain medicines did not work for him. At the time Applicant was questioned during his last background investigation in August 2020, he had not reported this prescription drug abuse to his employer. He told the investigator that he was thinking about reporting the abuse, but had not yet made the decision to do so. He claims that he stopped using the drug in August 2020.

The DCSA CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \neffective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant misused prescription medication from approximately \nJune 2017 to August 2020.

The evidence included in the FORM is identified as Items 4-5 (Items 1-3 \ninclude pleadings and transmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who \nreceived it on April 15, 2021. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not file any objections, \nbut he submitted an email to Department Counsel that I have marked as an exhibit (AE \nA). All exhibits are admitted into evidence without objection. The case was assigned to \nme on July 9, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted both allegations in the SOR. He also provided \nsome explanation for his conduct. I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. (Item 2) \nApplicant is 52 years old. He is married with no children. He served in his state\u2019s \nArmy National Guard from 2004-2011 and was honorably discharged. He has worked \nas a federal contractor since 2011. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since at least 2010. (Item 4) \nApplicant claims he abused the prescription drug Hydrocodone from 2017 to \n2020 because he suffers from a medical condition for which he was not receiving proper \nmedical treatment. At the time of his drug abuse, he held a security clearance. He \nobtained the Hydrocodone from his wife, who has a legal prescription for it. He used the \ndrug intermittently, about three times a month, to manage pain because over-the-\ncounter pain medicines did not work for him. At the time Applicant was questioned \nduring his last background investigation in August 2020, he had not reported this \nprescription drug abuse to his employer. He told the investigator that he was thinking \nabout reporting the abuse, but had not yet made the decision to do so. He claims that \nhe stopped using the drug in August 2020. (Items 3-5; AE A) \nApplicant claims that he started seeing a local physician about his medical \ncondition in August 2020. He also stated that he was in the process of contacting a \nrheumatologist to address his arthritic issues. He did not provide any medical records, \ndiagnoses, or prognoses from either of the doctors. He also stated that he used his \nemployer\u2019s anonymous tip-line to inquire about how to report his past drug abuse.

He claimed his civilian performance reviews were good, but he did not \nprovide any supporting documentation. I was unable to determine Applicant\u2019s credibility \nbased on demeanor, because he chose an administrative determination rather than a \nhearing. (Items 3, 5; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One condition is potentially applicable in this case, to wit: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nFrom 2017 to 2020, Applicant abused the prescription drug Hydrocodone without \na prescription, while holding a security clearance. I find that both the above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \nApplicant abused his wife\u2019s prescription for Hydrocodone by illegally taking the \ndrug himself approximately three times a month from June 2017 to August 2020. His \nuse was frequent and regular. Apparently, he still suffers from the medical condition that \nled to his illegal substance abuse, but he provided no medical information concerning a \ndiagnosis or prognosis. Given this state of the evidence, I am unable to state that future \ndrug abuse will not recur. His illegal use of his wife\u2019s prescription over a three-year \nperiod while holding a security clearance casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant acknowledges his illegal substance abuse of Hydrocodone, \nhis claimed recent abstinence of less than one year is insufficient to establish that a \npattern of abstinence exists. He also failed to provide a signed statement of intent to \nabstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse would be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. The Hydrocodone Applicant abused was prescribed for his \nwife, not for him. He had no legal reason to take the drug at any time. AG \u00b6 26(c) does \nnot apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his military and \ncontractor service, but I also considered that he illegally used Hydrocodone regularly for \napproximately three years while holding a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs \n1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Exhibit 3 at Section 25) He is employed as a junior software developer for a company doing business in the defense industry. He has had this job since about January 2020. Before that, he was enrolled as a full-time college student during 2015-2019, which resulted in a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2019. He has never married and has no children. Applicant disclosed a history of drug involvement and substance misuse in his February 2020 security clearance application. (Exhibit 5 at Section 23) His drug of choice was marijuana, for which he reported the following details: (1) he used marijuana with varying frequency, from daily to taking extended breaks in use, from about May 2015 to January 2020; and (2) he sold marijuana to close friends while he was a college student during 2016-2018 for two brief periods. In addition to marijuana, he reported using the prescription drug Adderall without a prescription during 2015-2018. He did so to help him stay up late to study. He also reported three to four instances of cocaine use during 2015-2019, and a single use of LSD in 2016. In addition to his substance misuse, Applicant disclosed a police record involving marijuana. (Exhibit 3 at Section 22) He was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana in August 2018.

Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guidelines known as \nGuideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, Guideline J for criminal \nconduct, and Guideline E for personal conduct. The sole allegation under Guideline E is \na cross-allegation to the various matters under Guidelines H and J. \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated one-page memorandum. He \nadmitted the various SOR allegations, and he asserted that he would not participate in \nsuch activities moving forward. He also provided a short explanation for why he believes \nhe is suitable for national security eligibility and listed two references. He did not provide \nsupporting documentation. He stated that he wished to have an administrative judge \nissue a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn July 19, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it August 6, 2021. He \ndid not reply to the FORM. The case was assigned to me October 6, 2021.    \n  Findings of Fact \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. (Exhibit 3 at Section 25) He is employed as a junior software \ndeveloper for a company doing business in the defense industry. He has had this job \nsince about January 2020. Before that, he was enrolled as a full-time college student \nduring 2015-2019, which resulted in a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2019. He has \nnever married and has no children. \nApplicant disclosed a history of drug involvement and substance misuse in his \nFebruary 2020 security clearance application. (Exhibit 5 at Section 23) His drug of \nchoice was marijuana, for which he reported the following details: (1) he used marijuana \nwith varying frequency, from daily to taking extended breaks in use, from about May \n2015 to January 2020; and (2) he sold marijuana to close friends while he was a college \nstudent during 2016-2018 for two brief periods. In addition to marijuana, he reported \nusing the prescription drug Adderall without a prescription during 2015-2018. He did so \nto help him stay up late to study. He also reported three to four instances of cocaine use \nduring 2015-2019, and a single use of LSD in 2016. \nIn addition to his substance misuse, Applicant disclosed a police record involving \nmarijuana. (Exhibit 3 at Section 22) He was arrested for driving under the influence of \nalcohol (DUI) and possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana in August 2018. He \nnoted that both offenses resulted in suspended imposition of sentence in August 2019. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs I understand it, a suspended imposition of sentence is typically used in this particular \nstate for first-time offenders who plead guilty and are then placed on probation. Along \nwith probation, the court required him to serve 40 hours of community service, complete \ntwo educational courses, attend a victim-impact panel, and pay a fine. \nApplicant provided additional details about his marijuana involvement during his \nbackground investigation. (Exhibit 4) Of note, in a May 2020 interview, he admitted \nusing marijuana about a week before the interview. He also admitted buying marijuana \none to two times monthly while a college student. Concerning his 2018 arrest, he \nexplained that he was placed on unsupervised probation for two years (until about \nAugust 2021) and paid $600 in fines. He noted the arrest was a life-changing event for \nhim because it was a wakeup call to stop being stupid and focus on his life and his \nfuture. \nIn reply to written interrogatories, Applicant admitted continued use of marijuana. \n(Exhibit 4) He stated that his frequency of use was monthly, and that his last use of \nmarijuana was November 14, 2020, which was the month before he answered the \ninterrogatories. Concerning his 2018 arrest, he stated that he was still serving \nunsupervised probation. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant wrote that he did not believe that the matters \nin the SOR reflected who he is, his trustworthiness, his alignment with national security, \nand his job performance. He described his successes at work, and that he is also \nworking to overcome the mistakes of his youth. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

The evidence shows \nthat Applicant has an extensive and recent history of marijuana use (2015-2020). In \nparticular, I note his continued marijuana use after submitting his February 2020 \nsecurity clearance application and while his case was pending adjudication. He was \nusing marijuana within a week of his May 2020 interview. Thereafter, he continued \nusing marijuana, monthly, with his last known usage occurring in November 2020. \nGiven his continued use of marijuana as recently as 2020, I conclude Applicant failed to \nclearly and convincing commit to discontinue such misuse. \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana and his \nother substance misuse as outlined in the findings of fact. It includes using marijuana for \nmore than five years and as recently as about November 2020. The latter fact means he \nsmoked marijuana during his employment with a federal contractor engaged in the \ndefense industry. Any illegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a person\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness, but it is particularly egregious if it occurs during the course of \nemployment with a federal contractor. Furthermore, it is likely that his marijuana use in \n2020 was in violation of his employer\u2019s drug-free workplace policy.9 \nApplicant\u2019s case in mitigation is not persuasive. The one item that stands out in \nhis favor is his candor and willingness to disclose his drug involvement and substance \nmisuse during the security clearance process. But the credit in mitigation is limited due \nto his continued marijuana use after completing his 2020 security clearance application. \n9 ISCR Case No. 16-00578 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2017) at 2 (noting the Drug-Free Workplace Act requires \nfederal contractors with a contract over $100,000 to establish certain drug-free workplace policies). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI also considered the two mitigating conditions noted above. Neither applies in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. His marijuana use occurred over a period of years and is recent \nenough to be of concern. It also occurred while his security clearance application was \npending. The latter circumstance cannot be overlooked, ignored, or explained away. \nWith that said, I am less concerned about his more limited substance misuse involving \ncocaine, LSD, and Adderall. That misuse was relatively infrequent and appears to have \nrun its course while Applicant was a college student. On this basis, I find for Applicant \non those allegations. Otherwise, the evidence is not sufficient to mitigate the drug-\nrelated security concern. \nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct, the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of involvement with \ncriminal conduct. The overall concern as set forth in AG \u00b6 30 is aptly put: \u201cBy its very \nnature, [criminal conduct] calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nAG \u00b6 31(c) individual is currently on parole or probation; \nAG \u00b6 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nThe SOR allegation under Guideline J is established. The key facts are not in \ndispute. Applicant was arrested in August 2018 for the misdemeanor offenses of DUI \nand possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana. About a year later in August 2019, \nhe pleaded guilty and received a disposition that is typically given for first-time \noffenders. He states that he satisfied the various terms and conditions imposed by the \ncourt, and it would appear that his term of unsupervised probation ended in about \nAugust 2021, a few months ago. \nNevertheless, the evidentiary record here creates much uncertainty. First, \nApplicant continued using marijuana while serving probation, which is troubling. \nSecond, he did not provide documentary proof that he successfully completed his term \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof probation and that his criminal case is now closed. The lack of documentary proof \nprovides additional reasons to be uncertain. Third, his continued use of marijuana \nduring 2020, after completing his security clearance application, means I cannot safely \nexclude the possibility that he may again face arrest and prosecution for a marijuana-\nrelated offense. The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcern. \nThe Guideline E matters consist of a sole allegation that is merely a cross-\nallegation to the various matters under Guidelines H and J, adding nothing of factual \nsubstance to the case. The judgment, honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline E are implicitly if not directly at issue under Guidelines H and J. \nAccordingly, the Guideline E matters are decided against Applicant under the same \nrationale set forth under Guidelines H and J. Additional discussion is unnecessary. \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. In particular, I gave \nweight to Applicant\u2019s relative youth and inexperience in the ways of the world, but those \nmatters are outweighed by his continued marijuana use while his security clearance \napplication was pending. I conclude that he has not met his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information.  \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 41, divorced his wife of 20 years in 2019. He has three children, ages 14, 17, and 21. He married his second wife in March 2020. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. He retired from the U.S. Air Force as an E-6 in 2018, after 20 years of service. Since then, he has been steadily employed by defense contractors; his most recent position as an instructor began in August 2019. He has maintained a security clearance since 1998. (Item 3; Item 4 at 2, 3) The SOR alleged three delinquent debts totaling $46,519, which were confirmed by the credit reports. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each allegation. (Items 2, 5, 6) Applicant obtained a debt consolidation loan in October 2016, which became delinquent in November 2017. The original creditor charged off the account in the amount of $31,505, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. It was transferred for collection in August 2020. Applicant claimed to have made three payments of $850 at some point, which would have reduced the balance to $28,955. However, in February 2021, the reported balance was $29,556. (Item 2; Item 3 at 46-48; Item 6) Applicant asserted that he had ongoing contacts with both the original creditor and the collection company for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but has been unable to reach an affordable agreement to resolve it.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 21, \n2019. On December 21, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DCSA CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 6, 2021, and requested a decision on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 17, 2021, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 6.

Items 3 through 6 are admitted \ninto evidence. Item 4 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nHowever, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 4. The Government \nincluded in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the \nadmissibility of Item 4 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also \nnotified that if he did not raise any objection to Item 4 in his response to the FORM, or if \nhe did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such \nobjection, and that Item 4 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant \nneither responded to the FORM nor objected to Item 4. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 41, divorced his wife of 20 years in 2019. He has three children, \nages 14, 17, and 21. He married his second wife in March 2020. He earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2009. He retired from the U.S. Air Force as an E-6 in 2018, after 20 years of \nservice. Since then, he has been steadily employed by defense contractors; his most \nrecent position as an instructor began in August 2019. He has maintained a security \nclearance since 1998. (Item 3; Item 4 at 2, 3) \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent debts totaling $46,519, which were confirmed \nby the credit reports. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each allegation. (Items 2, \n5, 6) \nApplicant obtained a debt consolidation loan in October 2016, which became \ndelinquent in November 2017. The original creditor charged off the account in the \namount of $31,505, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. It was transferred for collection in August \n2020. Applicant claimed to have made three payments of $850 at some point, which \nwould have reduced the balance to $28,955. However, in February 2021, the reported \nbalance was $29,556. (Item 2; Item 3 at 46-48; Item 6) \nApplicant asserted that he had ongoing contacts with both the original creditor \nand the collection company for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but has been unable to \nreach an affordable agreement to resolve it. He outlined those contacts in his November \n2019 SCA, which included an agreement to settle the debt for a lump-sum payment of \n$16,000 from the proceeds of the sale of his marital home. Applicant made no mention \nof the agreement during his March 2020 security clearance interview or in his January \n2021 SOR answer. During the interview, he averred that he had been working on a \npayment plan since 2018, but his creditor would not accept anything less than the full \namount owed. In his SOR answer, he reported the most recent settlement offer: a lump-\nsum payment of 50% of the balance owed.

He was unable to provide evidence of the three $850 \npayments because the account from which he made them was a joint account he \nmaintained with his former spouse, which had been closed following the divorce. The \nbank where the account was held is unable to retrieve documents from closed \naccounts. (Item 2; Item 4 at 5) \nApplicant obtained an unsecured loan in June 2016. After the account became \ndelinquent in October 2017, the original creditor charged off the account in the amount \nof $13,195, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He has not paid any sums towards satisfaction of \nthis debt. In his January 2021 SOR answer, Applicant asserted that he had ongoing \ncontacts with the original creditor and, beginning in 2019, the collection company. He \nalso maintained that he could not afford to make a lump-sum payment for the full \namount, which is all either creditor would accept. (Items 2, 6) \nIn July 2019, an apartment rental account became delinquent. The original \ncreditor placed it for collection in October 2019 in the amount of $1,819, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant averred that he co-signed this account for another person, but \nacknowledged his responsibility for repaying it. He has not paid any sums towards \nsatisfaction of this debt. In his January 2021 SOR answer, he asserted that he planned \nto pay the debt \u201cin the next few months\u201d given that that he \u201cnow\u201d has the \u201cmeans to pay\u201d \nit. (Items 5, 6) \nApplicant described his divorce as \u201ccomplicated.\u201d In May 2017, a court issued a \ntemporary order pending the final divorce that required Applicant to pay his spouse \n$1,500 per month for alimony, granted him custody of the children (without a child \nsupport award), and assigned him the responsibility for paying the household expenses \nand marital debts. Pursuant to his May 2019 final divorce, Applicant was ordered to sell \nthe marital home. He did not proffer any more terms of the final decree. (Items 2 at 1; 3 \nat 46-48; 4 at 4) \nApplicant attributed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b to his divorce. In his \nJanuary 2021 SOR answer, he asserted that prior to the May 2017 order, he maintained \na net remainder of approximately $600 per month (despite having characterized his \nfinances during that same timeframe as \u201cliving paycheck to paycheck\u201d in his November \n2019 SCA). However, he claimed that he was unable to afford to pay both alimony and \nhis ongoing expenses and debts because of the financial strain caused by the May \n2017 order. Thus, he made \u201can analyzed and well thought out decision\u201d that the \u201clesser \nof two evils\u201d would be to pay alimony over the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b to \navoid being held in contempt of court. He chose those two accounts because he \nbelieved that they were \u201cthe least of [his] problems.\u201d In November 2017, Applicant took \non a part-time second job to help pay for household expenses and alimony. However, \nhe resigned in February 2018 because the hours he worked were \u201cstarting to affect [his] \nkids, health and primary duties in the military.\u201d (Item 2; Item 3 at 19, 46-48; Item 4 at 4) \nApplicant anticipated that he would resolve his debts once his divorce became \nfinal and his martial home was sold.

Applicant did not \nproffer evidence of when or if his marital home was sold, or what, if any, proceeds he \nreceived. In his November 2019 SCA, Applicant expected the house to be sold \u201cin the \nnext few months.\u201d His January 2021 credit report suggests that it may have been sold in \nFebruary 2020, which is the date that his mortgage account was paid and closed. \nDuring his March 2020 security clearance interview, Applicant asserted that he had \ngained more control over his debt and had rebounded since the divorce. He declared \nthat he was then willing and able to pay all debts. In his January 2021 SOR answer, \nApplicant explained that he is only able to repay his debts via monthly payments. (Item \n2; Item 3 at 46-48; Item 4 at 5; Item 6 at 6) \nApplicant has not received any financial counseling. His credit reports revealed \nextensive reliance on consumer credit over the years. Between June 2018 and \nSeptember 2019, Applicant opened four new credit accounts, including a jewelry charge \naccount (with high credit of $4,791), and three automobile-loan accounts (with high \ncredits of $22,165, $5,261, and $2,364). As of February 2021, he was current on all four \naccounts. (Items 5, 6; Item 4 at 5) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant argued that the financial struggles stemming from \nhis divorce should be viewed in light of his history of otherwise \u201cperfect\u201d credit and years \nof service without any security incidents or other trustworthiness concerns. He also \nstated that the SOR debts were not caused by a \u201clack of judgment,\u201d but rather an \nintentional decision to prioritize court-ordered alimony. He deployed to a combat zone in \n2009. (Item 2; Item 3 at 11-12) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

However, he has substantial delinquent debts that remain unresolved. While he \nproffered compelling circumstances that undoubtedly impacted his family, he did not \nmeet his burden to establish that the SOR debts were accrued (and have persisted) \nlargely due to those circumstances, or that he acted responsibly to address them. \nI considered that Applicant was unable to access certain financial documents. \nHowever, that does not fully relieve him of the obligation to substantiate his mitigation \nclaims. I do not have information sufficient to conclude that Applicant exhausted all \nresources available to him to resolve his debts. I have doubts about whether Applicant \nis willing and able to fulfill his promise of resolving the debts, especially since he has not \nyet resolved even the smallest of them (SOR \u00b6 1.c/$1,819). In light of the record before \nme, I cannot conclude that Applicant has control of his finances or otherwise mitigated \nthe Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) and the personal sacrifice \nassociated with Applicant\u2019s service in the U.S. Air Force. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his delinquent debts.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 29, 2019, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On January 4, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) and detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated January 13, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

His response was essentially a manifesto regarding drug laws: \n. . . I find the implication that one\u2019s moral or ethical worth can be defined by \nsuch simplistic/deterministic matrices to be lacking at best, prejudiced at \nworst. I can personally find no logical chain of events wherein my \nrelaxation/free time proclivities would override my common sense, ethics, \nor morality, especially in regard to my occupation & quality of my work.

One either \nfollows \u201cthe rules\u201d or not, whether it makes sense to do so is somehow \nbeside the point. As a logical argument, far worse drugs are legal (and thus \ndeemed moral/ethical within society . . . somewhat irrationally) and not \nunder scrutiny. Alcohol for example has far more profound effects on \njudgment, reaction time, etc. and is not noted as a \u201csecurity issue\u201d, never \nmind prescription painkillers or anything else like that. Without getting too \nfar down the rabbit hole, my stance is \u201cthe federal illegality of marijuana is \narbitrary.\u201d The medical & scientific facts all agree with this, the federal \ngovernment appears to listen more to special interest groups & a sincere \ndesire to not look like they overreacted with the whole \u201cwar on drugs\u201d \ncampaign of the 1980s.

After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 37-year-old project engineer of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving in that position with his current sponsor since May 2013. He previously served in \nan identical capacity with a subcontractor from 2011 until 2013. He is a 2001 high school \ngraduate, and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in \nAugust 2001, and remained on active duty until August 2005, when he was honorably \ndischarged. Because of a failed urinalysis, he was denied a security clearance in 2002. \nHe was married in 2011 and divorced in 2016. He has two children, born in 2011 and \n2013. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and Personal Conduct \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was \nmarijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. He initially used marijuana in September \n1997, and has continued using it on a weekly basis (including a few times per week) until \nat least June 2019, when he was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). He has every intention of using it in the future because \nhe does not view marijuana use as being wrong, despite the fact that such use may be a \ncrime. He generally uses marijuana in bowls, alone or with friends. He purchases \nmarijuana monthly for personal use in \u201cflower format\u201d or shares marijuana furnished to \nhim by others, and did so until at least June 2019. He uses marijuana to relax, and denies \nbeing coerced to use it. Marijuana helps him to not \u201coverthink.\u201d He has never received \ndrug counseling or treatment. He has never attempted to stop using marijuana. (Item 3; \nItem 4) \nIn December 2001, while on active duty, Applicant was administered a command-\ndirected urinalysis, and he tested positive for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). As a result, \nhe was administered non-judicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ) for violation of Article 112a, UCMJ (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 812a). He was given 45 \ndays of extra duty and restriction, and ordered to forfeit $522 for two months.

The vehicle was searched, and unspecified drug \nparaphernalia was uncovered. Applicant was arrested and charged with use, possession, \nor delivery of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor. He was subsequently convicted as \ncharged, and ordered to perform between 40 and 80 hours of community service. Item 3; \n(Item 4; Item 5; Item 6) \nPolicies \n \n \n(4th Cir. 1994).) \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . purchase, \nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant is admittedly a recreational substance abuser whose substance of \nchoice is marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. He has regularly used \nmarijuana from September 1997 until at least June 2019, when he was interviewed by an \nOPM investigator. He has regularly purchased marijuana and shared it with others. In \n2001, while enlisted in the U.S. Army, he tested positive for THC following a command-\nordered urinalysis, and he received non-judicial punishment. In 2009, he was arrested, \ncharged, and convicted of use, possession, or delivery of drug paraphernalia. He has \nrepeatedly expressed an intent to continue to use marijuana because he disagrees with \nthe law and does not believe using marijuana is wrong, despite the fact that such use may \nbe a crime. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c), and 25(g) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nNeither condition applies. Applicant has purchased and used marijuana frequently \nfor over two decades; has never received treatment and counseling as a result of his \nillegal use of marijuana; has been disciplined by the military for a positive urinalysis; has \nbeen arrested, charged, and convicted of use, possession, or delivery of drug \nparaphernalia; and he has no intention of ceasing his marijuana use. He was open about \nhis past, continuing, and future relationship with marijuana, and for that candor, he is \ngiven credit. \nHe has objected to any compliance with marijuana laws and regulations, simply \nbecause he disagrees with them. In a free society, he is free to object to those laws and \nregulations, but in ignoring them, he runs the risk of additional punishment should he \nviolate the law. Moreover, his position is inconsistent with eligibility for a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s refusal to disavow future marijuana use continues to cast \nsubstantial doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. He is a 37-year-old project \nengineer of a defense contractor. He has been serving in that position with his current \nsponsor since May 2013. He previously served in an identical capacity with a \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nsubcontractor from 2011 until 2013. He is a 2001 high school graduate, and received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 2001, and remained \non active duty until August 2005 when he was honorably discharged. He has been candid \nin acknowledging his past, current, and future association with marijuana. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is admittedly a recreational substance abuser, and he has had a close affiliation \nwith marijuana for over two decades. He has purchased, used, and shared marijuana \nfrequently; has never received treatment and counseling as a result of his illegal use of \nmarijuana; has been disciplined by the military for a positive urinalysis; and has been \narrested, charged, and convicted of use, possession, or delivery of drug paraphernalia. \nHe has no intention of ceasing his marijuana use. He has shown a proven unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations in using marijuana, and he intends to continue using \nmarijuana in the future. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse and his personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The cited sources contain more specific information.) \nUnder the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from September 2001 to September 2006 and from January \n2011 to August 2017. The SOR also alleges Applicant used marijuana after being \ngranted access to classified information in approximately January 2011. In her \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegation with clarifications. She first states \nthe term \u201cwith varying frequency\u201d is vague and misleading. She has never been a \nconsistent or habitual user or marijuana. Her marijuana use was sporadic and she has \nnot used marijuana since August 2017. The first period, from 2011 to 2006, refers to \noccasional use during social situations while in college. Applicant states she recalls \nusing marijuana on three occasions in early 2017. She describes the use as a small \namount with friends. (Response to SOR, dated July 21, 2021) \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed her marijuana use to the Government during her \nsecurity clearance background investigations. On October 4, 2010, Applicant indicated \nthat she used marijuana in response to Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug \nActivity, on her security clearance application. She estimated that she used marijuana \nfrom September 2001 to September 2005, on ten occasions. \nDuring a subsequent background investigation interview in October 2010, \nApplicant provided the same information. She indicated she used marijuana \napproximately ten times while in college from September 2001 to September 2005. Her \nuse occurred while at parties or in social situations. She would take one or two puffs off \na joint that was being passed around. She never purchased, distributed, or grew \nmarijuana. Her marijuana use was sporadic. She told the investigator during her \nOctober 2010 background investigation interview that her last use of marijuana was in \nthe Spring 2006. (Gov 3 at 16) \nOn February 6, 2018, Applicant submitted another security clearance application \nas part of a periodic background reinvestigation.

(Gov 1, Section 23, at 67) \nDuring a background investigation interview on October 13, 2018 Applicant \nindicated she used marijuana infrequently from January 2011 to August 2017. Her last \nuse of marijuana was August 2017. She indicated that she never abused marijuana and \nthat her use of marijuana cannot subject her to blackmail. (Gov 3 at 8-9) \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals sent Applicant interrogatories \nregarding her past use. The first set asked Applicant to list her past illegal drug use. She \nlisted \u201cTHC\u201d (i.e. marijuana) and indicated the date of her first use was 2001 and the \ndate of her last use was 2017. She listed the frequency of use as \u201conce every three \nmonths.\u201d She acknowledged the information provided was true and correct to the best \nof her knowledge and belief. She signed the document before a notary public. No date \nwas provided with her signature. \nThe second set of interrogatories provided the unsworn summaries of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground investigation interviews from October 2018 and October 2010. Applicant \nwas instructed to read the interviews carefully. She was then instructed to provide any \ninformation that was not accurate in the interview summary. Applicant made corrections \nto both unsworn summaries. After making corrections to the unsworn summaries of \ninterview, she acknowledged before a notary on March 19, 2021, that she amended the \nreport and it is now accurate. (Gov 3 at 4-18). \nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted her answer to the interrogatories indicated \nshe used marijuana \u201conce every three months\u201d between 2001 to 2017. She indicated \nthat this was not accurate and that she intended the answer to mean that she used \nmarijuana once every three months in 2017. It was an omission on her part, and she \nwas not careful when reviewing the interrogatories. She intended her answer to be in a \nbroad fashion because she was concerned about omitting any of her illegal marijuana \nuse. (Tr. 32-36)   \nApplicant has not used marijuana since August 2017. She used marijuana \nbetween January 2017 and August 2017 in social settings. The amount of her use was \ntaking a puff or two on a marijuana joint while it was being passed around. She no \nlonger associates with the people with whom she used marijuana. She moved out of the \narea and has built a new social network.  (Tr. 22, 30-38, 42-44) \nOn July 12, 2021, Applicant signed a Statement of Intent declaring that she will \nnever misuse substances in the future, including use or possession of any illegal drug, \nor use of a legal prescription drug without a valid prescription or in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose.

(AE K; \nAE L) \nWhole-Person Factors \n \nApplicant is a highly regarded employee as indicated by her performance \nappraisals and awards. (AE E; AE N; AE O) She is also involved in her church and \ncoaches her son\u2019s soccer team. (AE Q; AE R) She is a dedicated wife and mother. (AE \nI) Several friends who know Applicant personally provided letters attesting to her \ncharacter, trustworthiness, and integrity. (AE  F; AE J; AE M).  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \n  \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d addressing \nconcerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local laws do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d  \n  \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana.  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case.  \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits she used marijuana on various occasions \nbetween 2001 and 2017. Primarily, she used marijuana on numerous occasions during \nhigh school and college. There were periods of years where she did not use marijuana. \nShe used marijuana on three occasions in 2017 in social situations. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nApplicant did not cultivate, purchase, or distribute marijuana. She did possess \nmarijuana when she used the marijuana. Based on this reason, AG \u00b6 25(c) applies. Her \nuse in 2017 occurred while she held a security clearance, although she was in a \nposition that did not require access to classified information. Applicant worked for a \nsubsidiary of the DOD contractor and admits her use of marijuana in 2017 was illegal. \nAG \u00b6 25(f) applies. \n  \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n  \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred over four \nyears ago. Applicant disclosed marijuana use on several security clearance applications \nin October 2010 and February 2018. Although Applicant\u2019s answers about her use of \nmarijuana varied in responses on her SF 86 and DOHA interrogatories, I find the \nvarious discrepancies to be minimal. Applicant was honest and forthright about her \nillegal marijuana use. She made no excuses for her marijuana use and admits her \nmarijuana use was illegal. While her marijuana use showed extremely poor judgment, \nshe has not used marijuana in over four years. Since that time, Applicant has built a \nsuccessful career and is an involved mother to her two young children. It is unlikely she \nwill use marijuana in the future. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies. Applicant stopped using marijuana in August 2017. She no \nlonger associates with the people she used marijuana with in social situations. Applicant \nprovided a signed statement of intent to refrain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. Applicant was truthful about her marijuana use and demonstrated an \nappropriate pattern of abstinence. She was never a habitual marijuana user, only taking \na puff or two while a joint was being passed around and parties. K.B.\u2019s substance abuse \nevaluation indicates Applicant does not have addiction issues. \nApplicant met her burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThere are reasons that support not granting a security clearance to Applicant. \nQuestions are raised about Applicant\u2019s judgment because of her admitted illegal use of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nmarijuana, while as an employee with a DOD contractor and while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. \nI find the mitigating reasons outweigh the disqualifying reasons in Applicant\u2019s \ncase. She disclosed her marijuana use during the security clearance process which \nsupports that she is trustworthy. She stopped using marijuana in August 2017 and has \nnot used marijuana for over four years. She signed a statement of intent to refrain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that any future \nsubstance misuse could result in the revocation of her security clearance. Applicant has \nbuilt a successful career and is highly regarded among her peers. Her free time is \ndevoted to raising her two young sons with her husband. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has learned a significant \nlesson. While her marijuana use showed poor judgment, she disclosed her marijuana \nuse during the security clearance process. She learned from her mistake in judgment \nand took steps to demonstrate her intent to refrain from illegal marijuana use. Concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. Applicant is warned \nthat any future use of illegal substances may result in the revocation of her security \nclearance. \nERIN C.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 36 years old. In June 2003, he received a high school diploma. He married in December 2003. His wife left him in 2017 and their divorce was concluded in 2018. They have two teenage children. Applicant presently lives with a cohabitant and her daughter. (Tr. at 15-16, 26-27.) Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2007. He deployed on two occasions to war zones and served as an Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Tech. In May 2017, however, he was discharged with an Other than Honorable characterization of service (OTH) in lieu of Trial by Court-Martial. He had previously been convicted in a General Court-Martial. His conviction was overturned on appeal, all of which is described further below. (Tr. at 19-28; AE A-C.) After his discharge, Applicant worked as a security guard. Starting in August 2017, he took some classes at a technical training school. In January 2018, he began working for his security clearance sponsor as a technician.

Department Counsel presented ten \nproposed exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10 which were \nadmitted without objection. I marked his exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit I. (Tr. at 9.) \nApplicant attached two exhibits to his Answer. I marked them as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A and B. Applicant offered a third exhibit at the hearing, which I marked as AE C. I \nleft the record open until May 19, 2021, to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. On May 19, he emailed three character reference \nletters, which I marked as AE D-F and additional copies of AE A through C. AE D-F was \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 24, 2021. \n(Tr. at 9.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. In June 2003, he received a high school diploma. He \nmarried in December 2003. His wife left him in 2017 and their divorce was concluded in \n2018. They have two teenage children. Applicant presently lives with a cohabitant and \nher daughter. (Tr. at 15-16, 26-27.) \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2007. He deployed on two occasions to war \nzones and served as an Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Tech. In May 2017, \nhowever, he was discharged with an Other than Honorable characterization of service \n(OTH) in lieu of Trial by Court-Martial. He had previously been convicted in a General \nCourt-Martial. His conviction was overturned on appeal, all of which is described further \nbelow. (Tr. at 19-28; AE A-C.) \nAfter his discharge, Applicant worked as a security guard. Starting in August 2017, \nhe took some classes at a technical training school. In January 2018, he began working \nfor his security clearance sponsor as a technician.

Certain events leading up to this incident provide \nimportant background information and context. \nIn 2011-2012, Applicant deployed to a war zone. During a layover on his return in \nOctober 2012, he and his fellow soldiers were given a direct order not to drink any alcohol. \nApplicant, who was a sergeant (E-5) at that time, nevertheless joined a group of more \nsenior non-commissioned officers at a party on October 4, 2012, where he and the others \ndrank alcohol. Applicant testified at the DOHA hearing that he only had one drink. His \nviolation of the order was reported. In January 2013, he received an Article 15 Non-\nJudicial Punishment for violating Articles 90 and 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice \n(UCMJ) (disobedience of a direct order). His punishment included counseling and 45 days \nof extra duty. (Tr. at 12, 16, 29-32; GE 6.) \nThe Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Army Division, (CAF) adjudicated \nwhether Applicant\u2019s misconduct warranted suspension of his top secret clearance \neligibility and access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). On November 7, \n2013, the CAF reaffirmed Applicant\u2019s eligibility and SCI access. The CAF also issued a \n\u201cWarning Notice\u201d to Applicant stating that a \u201csubsequent alcohol-related incident may \nresult in the suspension of your security clearance.\u201d Applicant acknowledged receiving \nthe warning. (Tr. at 47; GE 6 at 1.) \nLess than two months after this warning, Applicant was arrested for sexual assault \nat the end of a long evening of heavy alcohol drinking at the above-mentioned January 4, \n2014 birthday party. On May 8, 2014, charges were preferred against Applicant consisting \nof two specifications in violation of Article 120 of the UCMJ \u2013 rape, sexual assault, and \nother sexual misconduct. (GE 4 at 2.) \nThe record at Applicant\u2019s General Court-Martial, as summarized by the appellate \ncourt in its decision, sets forth a narrative of the events of that evening that sharply differs \nfrom Applicant\u2019s version presented at his DOHA hearing. The record reflects that \nApplicant, his then-wife, and their children attended the birthday party of the wife of \nanother sergeant (SGT) at SGT\u2019s home. One other couple attended the party. SGT\u2019s wife \n(W) celebrated her birthday by drinking heavily, starting in the morning and continuing \nthroughout the afternoon and late into the evening. The spouse of the third couple \nassisted W to her bedroom after W had vomited. She covered W with a blanket in her \nbed, and W fell asleep. She was wearing leggings and a long shirt. (GE 4 at 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife and children retired to a second bedroom in SGT\u2019s house and had \nfallen asleep. Late in the evening, SGT fell asleep or passed out on a sofa in his living \nroom after drinking an excessive amount of alcohol. The third couple decided to leave the \nparty. The husband of the third couple, also an Army NCO, slapped SGT in the face trying \nto wake him to say goodnight. He was unable to wake SGT. He and his wife then left the \nparty, leaving Applicant alone, W asleep in her bedroom, and her husband passed out on \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe living room sofa. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant did not materially dispute the above \nstatement of the facts. (Tr. at 13-45; GE 4 at 2.) \nW testified at the Court-Martial that she felt someone climb into her bed behind her \nand start touching her body. She thought it was her husband. The person then pulled \ndown her leggings and underwear and penetrated her vagina with his fingers. At that \npoint, she was awake enough to realize that the person in her bed was not her husband. \nShe testified that she looked behind her and saw Applicant. She ran from her bedroom \ninto the living room with her pants pulled down and unsuccessfully tried to wake up her \nhusband. Applicant followed W into her living room, pushed her down onto a second sofa, \nand again inserted his fingers into her vagina. SGT then woke up, and Applicant retreated \nto another part of the house. (GE 4 at 2.) \nA forensic biology expert testified that Applicant\u2019s left hand contained a large \namount of W\u2019s DNA. The expert opined that W\u2019s DNA was \u201cmore than likely or a possibility \nof being from a biological fluid.\u201d The expert also did not rule the possibility that the DNA \non Applicant\u2019s left hand could have come from a \u201cheavy touch\u201d of W and suggested that \na handshake could possibly produce the transfer of DNA from one person to another. (GE \n4 at 2.) \nAt the DOHA hearing, Applicant testified about the events of that evening. He said \nthat he and his family arrived at the party at about 5 pm. He had started drinking alcohol \nat his home and continued to drink \u201cheavily\u201d the rest of the night, consuming beer, tequila, \nand vodka. Applicant admitted that he was an alcoholic at that time. Applicant testified \nthat he had \u201ca really good relationship with the [SGT].\u201d They worked together and trained \ntogether. Applicant knew SGT for about a year and knew W just as long. Applicant \ndescribed W as \u201cflirtatious,\u201d \u201creal vulgar and real flirtatious with most people,\u201d including \nApplicant. At the DOHA hearing, he described SGT and W as \u201cquestionable characters.\u201d \n(Tr. 37-40.) \nApplicant testified further that his spouse and children left the others at the party \nand went to a bedroom in W\u2019s house to watch TV. He was unaware of her \u201cstatus,\u201d i.e., \nwhether she then slept or stayed awake. He denied knowing that W had gone to bed. He \ntestified that SGT was passed out on his living room sofa. Applicant was alone and \nintoxicated in the residence, but he was awake. He denied entering W\u2019s bedroom and \nsexually assaulting her. He also denied sexually assaulting her in her living room. He \ncould not recall where he was at the time of the alleged incidents. He did not see her run \ninto the living room with her pants pulled down. Applicant testified that he spent his time \nlate that evening sitting at the table in the dining room, which was part of the living room, \nplaying music on his phone. Then, SGT was suddenly yelling at him and assaulted him \ncausing bruising and injuries. He has no idea why SGT thought Applicant had assaulted \nhis wife, though he later admitted in his testimony that he understood that SGT\u2019s actions \nwere based on what W told her husband about Applicant\u2019s actions. He never heard W try \nto wake up her husband. He testified that he has no idea why she made the accusations \nagainst him. He also has no idea why his left hand had W\u2019s DNA on it.

The U.S. Army \nCriminal Investigation Command conducted an investigation. The investigators \nconcluded that there was probable cause to believe that Applicant had engaged in an \nunlawful sexual act with W while she was impaired and incapable of apprising the sexual \nact due to the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The Trial Counsel in the Office of the \nStaff Judge Advocate (SJA) concurred, concluding that probable cause existed to believe \nthat Applicant committed the offense of Sexual Assault in violation of Article 120 of the \nUCMJ. (Tr. at 23; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 2, 5.) \nThe General Court-Martial began on November 4, 2014. Applicant pleaded not \nguilty to two specifications of Sexual Assault and did not testify. On November 5, 2014, \nthe members found Applicant guilty on both specifications and sentenced him to serve \nsix years in prison and to be dishonorably discharged from the Army. He was also \nsentenced to be reduced to the grade of E-1 and to forfeit all pay and allowances. On \nSeptember 1, 2015, the convening authority reduced Applicant\u2019s sentence to four years \nand upheld the remaining sentence. (GE 9.) \nApplicant appealed his conviction. On January 30, 2017, the Army Court of \nCriminal Appeals overturned the conviction. The Court ruled that the military judge gave \nan erroneous jury instruction regarding Applicant\u2019s propensity to commit acts of sexual \nmisconduct based upon the allegations in the other specification in the charges. The \nCourt authorized a rehearing. (GE 4 at 3-4.) \nOn March 20, 2017, Applicant requested a discharge in lieu of Trial by Court-\nMartial (Request) pursuant to Army Regulation 635-200, Chapter 10. On March 27, 2017, \nW submitted through her special victim counsel a memorandum in which she declined to \nparticipate in any further court-martial proceedings, rendering a retrial unfeasible. At that \npoint, Applicant had served two and one-half years in prison. If convicted again on retrial, \nhe could only be sentenced to the remainder of his original sentence. The SJA \nrecommended on April 11, 2017, that Applicant\u2019s Request be granted with an Other than \nHonorable characterization of service. The Commanding General approved the Request \non April 21, 2017. Applicant\u2019s DD214 reflects that his discharge from the Army on May 9, \n2017, was \u201cIn Lieu Of Trial by Court-Martial\u201d and was \u201cUnder Other Than Honorable \nConditions.\u201d (Tr. at 13, AE A\u2013C.) \nIn 2016, while Applicant was incarcerated, his wife left him for another man. \nApplicant testified at the DOHA hearing that she did not want to be with him because he \ncould not provide for her due to his incarceration. His children now treat him differently. \nHe feels that he has lost everything by making the mistake of being around people who \ndrank excessively and just wanted to party. He no longer drinks to excess and only drinks \non special occasions. While incarcerated, he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings \nand received help for his alcoholism, though he stopped attending meetings in July 2017, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout two months after his discharge.

(Tr. at 14-15, 22, 27-28, 42-43, 47, 49-50.) \nCredibility \nAt the DOHA hearing, Applicant\u2019s denial of any sexual misconduct in January 2014 \nrested on his credibility with the support of his character references, discussed below. In \naddition to a general demeanor assessment, Applicant\u2019s credibility was tested by \nquestions and his testimony regarding a material omission in his 2018 SCA. He provided \na negative response to the initial question in Section 25, which is titled Investigations and \nClearance Record. The question asks: \nHas the U.S. Government (or a foreign government) EVER investigated \nyour background and/or granted you a security clearance eligibility/access? \n(Emphasis in the original.) \nApplicant was, in fact, investigated and granted a security clearance in 2007 at the time \nhe enlisted or soon thereafter. At the time of his NJP in 2012, he held a top secret \nclearance and had been granted access to SCI, which required at least one and perhaps \ntwo further investigations. As noted above, the CAF issued a Warning Notice to Applicant. \nThe notice advised him that any additional alcohol-related misconduct could result in the \nsuspension of his clearance and SCI access. Applicant testified that as an EOD Tech he \nwas required to have both a clearance and access. (Tr. at 32-35.) \nWhen Applicant was asked why he provided an incorrect answer to the simple \nquestion quoted above, he could not provide a response. He testified: \u201cI don\u2019t understand \nwhy I would write that.\u201d When asked if he intentionally omitted information about his past \ninvestigations and clearance status to shield himself during his 2018 background \ninvestigation from further inquiry about his 2013 NJP and the CAF\u2019s Warning Notice, he \ndenied any such intent. He could not explain why he did not understand the simple \nlanguage of the question in Section 25 of his SCA quote above and why he responded \nincorrectly. (Tr. at 32-35.) \nApplicant\u2019s credibility was also tested by his testimony at the DOHA hearing \nregarding a critical element in his Chapter 10 Request for discharge. Under Army \nRegulation 635-200 \u00b6 10-2.e, a soldier requesting a discharge must acknowledge in his \nrequest that he understands the elements of the offense he is charged with committing \nand that he is guilty of the charge or a lesser included offense. In his testimony at the \nDOHA hearing, Applicant made no mention of having admitted his guilt to the sexual \nassault in the Request nor did he submit a copy of the Request. He testified that he \nadmitted in his Request to drinking to excess, though he was not charged with that as a \ncrime. The only documentation he provided was the approvals of his Request by the SJA \nand the convening authority and his DD214.

(AE C.) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted three personal reference letters. His former \nfirst-line supervisor/team leader in the Army provided a passionate defense of Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior, both his behavior in the incident preceding the NJP and with respect to the \nsexual assault charges. He believes that Applicant was pressured to drink alcohol by his \nplatoon commander upon his return from deployment. The former supervisor wrote that \nhe testified at the NJP in support of Applicant. He also believes Applicant\u2019s claims of \ninnocence on the sexual assault accusations. He pointed to the fact that the Army did not \nretry the case following the appeal and argued that, in his view, this demonstrates the \nweakness in the Army\u2019s case against Applicant. He also wrote that he knows Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cmoral compass\u201d and does not believe he would ever commit the sexual assault of which \nhe is accused. He described Applicant as a \u201cmodel, trustworthy individual.\u201d (AE D.) \nApplicant\u2019s two other references are his direct supervisor and his manager at his \ncurrent employer. Both references endorsed Applicant\u2019s integrity, character, and \ncompetence in performing his duties safely. His direct supervisor noted that Applicant has \nheld clearances throughout his Army and post-discharge employment and has never had \na security violation. The supervisor also described Applicant as open and honest. He \nargued that Applicant\u2019s Court-Martial was not fair because the Army\u2019s criminal justice \nsystem presumes guilt in sexual assault cases, an argument that Applicant also made at \nthe DOHA hearing.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n7 \n\n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG & 31 contains five potentially disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise security concerns. Two conditions apply to the facts found in this case: \n(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\"Honorable.\" \nThe record established by substantial evidence that Applicant committed two \nserious felonies in January 2014 involving sexual assaults on W. Both the SJA Trial \nCounsel and the Convening Authority concluded that there was probable cause to believe \nthat Applicant sexually assaulted W twice in the evening of January 4-5, 2014. Applicant \noffered no explanation, credible or otherwise, as to why W accused him of sexually \nassaulting her twice if he did not commit these crimes. Also, it was undisputed that \nApplicant was discharged from the Army in 2015 for reasons less than Honorable, \nspecifically under Other than Honorable Conditions due to misconduct. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and \n31(e) apply. Accordingly, further review is required. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct. Three of the conditions potentially \napply: \n(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred more \nthan seven years ago. His crimes occurred at a time when he was drinking heavily and \nwere possibly the result of his loss of judgment and control due to his intoxicated \ncondition. He now drinks alcohol moderately on rare occasions. Accordingly, the \ncircumstances are unusual in view of his current level of alcohol consumption. On the \nother hand, Applicant\u2019s denial of responsibility for his criminal behavior lacks credibility, \nwhich makes it difficult to conclude that such behavior is unlikely to recur. Moreover, his \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is not established. There is substantial, reliable record evidence that \nApplicant committed the crimes of sexual assault with which he was charged. The fact \nthat his conviction was overturned on appeal on an erroneous jury instruction does not \nestablish that there is no reliable evidence to support the accusation that he sexually \nassaulted W. Applicant could provide no reason why W would fabricate serious charges \nagainst him. Applicant and his spouse were friends of W and her husband and were one \nof two couples invited to celebrate her birthday at her house.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in support of his denials of any criminal conduct was limited \nto his testimony with support from his references. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony about \nhis innocence to be credible. His demeanor at the DOHA hearing was uncomfortable and \nhis testimony was vague as to all relevant details. He could provide no explanation as to \nwhy W would falsely accuse him of sexually assaulting her twice. In addition, he was the \nonly person in W\u2019s residence with the opportunity to sexually assault her. I also found \nApplicant\u2019s testimony on two other matters to be untrustworthy. He could not explain his \nnegative response on his 2018 SCA as to whether he had ever been investigated for \nsecurity clearance eligibility in the past. Also, his lack of candor about the details of his \nRequest regarding his admission of a crime of which he had been accused, i.e., sexual \nassault, undercuts his credibility.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is only partially established. A significant amount of time has passed \nsince the criminal conduct and Applicant has not been accused of any further criminal \nconduct of any nature. Applicant served two and one-half years in prison before his \nconviction was overturned. He pursued technical training and has been employed with a \nU.S. Government contractor since 2018. His supervisor and manager wrote that he \nperforms his job effectively and with great care for the safety of others. On the other hand, \nhis refusal to accept responsibility for his criminal conduct undercuts all of his evidence \nof rehabilitation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncriminal conduct and his denial of such conduct cast serious doubts on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSexual Behavior \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 12 as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG & 13 contains five potentially disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise security concerns. Three conditions apply to the facts found in this case: \n(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe record evidence established that Applicant committed the sexual assaults. It \nis undisputed that his conviction was overturned on appeal due to an erroneous jury \ninstruction that was inconsistent with his presumption of innocence. The Army could have \nretried Applicant if W had been willing to testify again. Without her testimony, the Army \ntook the next best course of action and accepted Applicant\u2019s Request for discharge in \nLieu of Trial by Court-Martial. Nothing in those facts supports a conclusion that the Army \nhad lost confidence in its original prosecution. At the DOHA hearing, the Government met \nits burden to prove the criminal sexual behavior with substantial evidence. In addition, the \ncharges against Applicant carry a significant stigma that renders him vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, and duress. Lastly, Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior in the home of \nSGT, a friend and fellow NCO, while under the influence of alcohol reflects a serious lack \nof discretion and judgment. The above AGs apply. Accordingly, further review is required. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 14 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug involvement. Two of the conditions potentially \napply: \n(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) is only partially established. The analysis set forth above under AG \u00b6 \n32(a) applies equally under this mitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 13(c) is not established. Although Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior occurred a \nnumber of years ago, the seriousness of the nature of his sexual behavior renders it an \nongoing basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and D in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors warrant additional \ncomments. I have given significant weight to Applicant\u2019s excellent record in the Army \nserving our country in two war zones performing very dangerous work. I have also \nweighed the fact that Applicant has a history of abusing alcohol, which is likely related to \nhis PTSD following two deployments. Nevertheless, there is no dispute that he violated a \ndirect order not to drink alcohol nor is there a dispute that he was highly intoxicated the \nnight of the sexual assault. In the absence of any alternative explanation as to why W \naccused Applicant of sexually assaulting her twice, his denial is not credible. I found his \ndemeanor at the DOHA hearing to be uncomfortable and his denials of sexual misconduct \nto be unconvincing. Overall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and D and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to satisfy his burden to mitigate security concerns arising from his past criminal \nconduct and sexual behavior. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1. Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of the entire record, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Her SOR admissions, and those in her answers to the FORM and the documents submitted, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 31 years old. She graduated from high school in 2008, and attended college between 2008 and 2011, but did not earn a degree. Her 2019 SCA work history indicates she has been employed since 2012 with various employers. She started working for her current employer, a federal contractor and her clearance sponsor, in January 2019. This is her first clearance application. She married in 2010 and divorced in 2017. She has no children. The 2019 SCA indicates she has been living with a cohabitant since February 2018. In response to questions in Section 26 (Financial Record) of her 2019 SCA, Applicant stated that she had failed to file federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2013 through 2019, and had failed to pay her federal and state income taxes as required.

Without objections, \nadmitted and considered all of the FORM\u2019s proffered evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the three SOR allegations, which \ninclude her failure to timely file: federal income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2013 \nthrough 2019 (\u00b6 1.a); income tax returns for state \u201cA\u201d for TYs 2013 and 2014 (\u00b6 1.b); \nand income tax returns for state \u201cB\u201d for TYs 2014 through 2019 (\u00b6 1.c). Her SOR \nadmissions, and those in her answers to the FORM and the documents submitted, are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 31 years old. She graduated from high school in 2008, and attended \ncollege between 2008 and 2011, but did not earn a degree. Her 2019 SCA work history \nindicates she has been employed since 2012 with various employers. She started \nworking for her current employer, a federal contractor and her clearance sponsor, in \nJanuary 2019. This is her first clearance application. She married in 2010 and divorced \nin 2017. She has no children. The 2019 SCA indicates she has been living with a \ncohabitant since February 2018. \nIn response to questions in Section 26 (Financial Record) of her 2019 SCA, \nApplicant stated that she had failed to file federal and state income tax returns for TYs \n2013 through 2019, and had failed to pay her federal and state income taxes as \nrequired. She explained that her filing of those income tax returns was delayed for many \n2 \nI \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndifferent reasons. In 2013, her husband left her and she forgot to file her income tax \nreturn. She was living by herself and having a rough time with her divorce, and she was \nmaking sure she could live on her own. In 2014, she was living on her own and had \nback-to-back high electric bills that had to be paid, and she could not afford to get her \ntaxes done. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, she was living with her grandmother and taking \ncare of her financially and medically and pushed back her tax filing to make sure basic \nnecessities were provided, because she was not making enough money to pay her \ntaxes and her living expenses. In 2018 and 2019, she was working with an accountant \nto get her taxes resolved. \nDuring her September 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, \nApplicant reiterated her 2019 SCA explanations for her failure to file her income tax \nreturns. She stated her current financial situation was not great, but she was working on \nit. She indicated her willingness and ability to pay her debts, and promised to file her \ndelinquent income tax returns and to pay her delinquent taxes. She stated she would \nmake changes when she marries in October 2019. She believed her fianc\u00e9 would take \ncare of her finances and help her resolve her tax problems. As of the date of her \ninterview, she had not participated in financial counseling. \nIn her two April 2021 responses to the FORM, Applicant submitted documentary \nevidence showing that in April 2021, she retained a bookkeeping firm to help her file her \ndelinquent income tax returns. The firm prepared and submitted Applicant\u2019s federal and \nstate income tax returns for TYs 2012 through 2020 in April 2021, except for the state \nTY 2014 income tax return that was not filed because she was missing her W-2. \nAccording to her income tax returns, Applicant anticipates receiving refunds for \nTYs 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019, and 2020. She issued checks to pay owed taxes for \nTY 2015 ($921); TY 2016 ($1,236); and TY 2017 ($170). She acknowledged that the \nIRS still has to accept her filings and that she will likely owe an undetermined amount of \nmoney to the IRS for applicable penalties and interest charges. \nIn her April 2021 responses to the FORM, Applicant stated that she has learned \na hard lesson as a result of her tax problems and the clearance process. She promised \nto timely file her federal and state income tax returns in the future and to expeditiously \npay any owed taxes. She noted that she has been honest and upfront during the \nsecurity clearance process and disclosed her tax deficiencies in her 2019 SCA. She \nbelieves that filing her tax returns and paying her taxes will show she no longer will \nrepeat the same mistakes, and that she is not a security risk. \nApplicant did not present evidence of her current financial situation (gross \nmonthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). She did \nnot present evidence to show that she has a working budget. There is no evidence to \nshow she has had recent financial counseling. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec.

Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must be \nconsidered. [First time SEAD used] \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue her or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. As alleged in the \nSOR, she failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2013 through \n2019. Although not alleged, she also failed to timely pay income taxes as required for \nTYs 2015, 2016, and 2017. She paid those taxes in 2021. \nI note that the record shows that Applicant failed to timely file both federal and \nstate income tax returns for TYs 2012 and 2020, and that she failed to timely pay taxes \nfor TYs 2015 through 2017. Because TY 2012 and the years she failed to timely pay her \ntaxes were not alleged in the SOR, I will only consider them for the limited purpose of \nevaluating Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d and \n\u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns . . . or failure to \npay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record established \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nthese disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant claimed that the filing of her income tax returns was delayed for many \nreasons set out above (pgs. 2-3).

However, these circumstances when considered in light of the number of \nyears without timely filing income tax returns, and the lack of evidence of \ncommunications with the IRS and her state tax authorities before she received the SOR, \nare insufficient to prove she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nIn regard to the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See \nISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful \nconsideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax \nreturns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd.

He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \nNotwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed when he filed his tax returns, the \nAppeal Board provided the following principal rationale for reversing the grant of a \nsecurity clearance: \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government \nrules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information. . . . By failing to file his \n2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, [that \napplicant] did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information. \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies because Applicant has filed all of her late income tax returns, \nalbeit on or after April 2021. She also paid the IRS her tax debt for TYs 2015 through \n2017 in April 2021. The timing of the filing of her tax returns is an important aspect of \nthe analysis. In ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal \nBoard reversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, \nand noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal \nincome tax returns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his \nbackground interview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such \nremedial action might otherwise merit. \nUnder all the circumstances, including the jurisprudence from the DOHA Appeal \nBoard, Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. Considering the record as a whole, I am unable to find that Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to timely file \nher income tax returns or to pay her delinquent income taxes prior to April 2021. Her \nfinancial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate \ndetermination\u201d of whether to grant a security clearance \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant, 31, has worked for a federal contractor since January 2019. This is her \nfirst SCA. The evidence against grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is substantial. As \nalleged in the SOR, she failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for TYs \n2013 through 2019. She also failed to timely pay income taxes as required for three \nyears. \nAs noted previously, the record evidence shows Applicant failed to timely file \nfederal and state income tax returns for TYs 2012 through 2020. I note again that some \nof the years she failed to timely file her income tax returns or to pay her taxes were not \nalleged in the SOR. Thus, I will only consider them for the limited purpose of evaluating \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation. \nWhen a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how \nlong an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax \nreturns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete \nmaking payments. The Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax \ncases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) \n(reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve \nhis tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security clearance was \nin jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does \nnot reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12\u00ad\n05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not \nall tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens). \nThe primary problem here is that Applicant knew that she needed to file her state \nand federal income tax returns. Whether she knew she was going to receive refunds or \nhad sufficient or insufficient funds to pay any taxes owed, she had a requirement to \ntimely file her tax returns. She did not fully understand or appreciate the importance of \ntimely filing of tax returns in security clearance determinations.

Unmitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not \nwarranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security \nclearance in the future. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated at \nthis time. \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on May 26, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 40 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. He is employed by \na defense contractor as a Software Engineer. \nHe is seeking to retain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment. \nApplicant has a history of sexual misconduct extending over a period of twelve \nyears. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) He began working for his current employer in \nJuly 2002, and has held a security clearance since about 2003 or 2005. (Government \nExhibit 1, and Tr. p. 49.) Applicant admits in part and denies in part the sole factual \nallegation set forth in the SOR. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR.) \nApplicant was born in Burma, Myanmar. He came to the United States at the \nage of four. He grew up in the United States, and obtained his college degree here. \nAfter graduating from college, he was hired by his current employer with whom he has \nworked for the past nineteen years. He possessed a security clearance for fifteen years \nwithout incident. He has a favorable work history. Over the years, he has received \nsalary increases and promotions for good performance. (Tr. p. 23.) \nIn May 2017, during an interview with a polygraph examiner as part of a security \nclearance background investigation conducted by another agency, Applicant disclosed \nthat he paid prostitutes for sexual intercourse and other sexual services, both in the \nUnited States and overseas on at least 27 occasions between 2008 and 2016. In 2017, \nApplicant was denied his security clearance by another agency as a result of the \ninvestigation. Following this denial, Applicant continued to engage in sexual misconduct \non at least three more occasions, the most recent time occurred in 2019. He estimates \nthat over the years, he has spent approximately $6,500 for sexual services. Applicant \nstates that he paid prostitutes for sex in the United States and in foreign countries while \non vacation. Applicant further stated that he knew soliciting prostitution was illegal in \nthe United States. He also acknowledged that it was dangerous. Despite this, he \nstated that he never picked up a random prostitute. He figured that since he did not \npick the girls up off of the street, but, instead went to a massage parlor to obtain their \nservices, in a country where he believed it to be legal, it was less risky. To him, it \nappeared to be like official business in those places. (Tr. pp. 29-42.)

He believed it to be legal in the foreign country he was visiting and \nso he did not give it any further concern. During his interview on May 2017, Applicant \nstated that he did not see anything wrong with this type of behavior. He adds that his \nsexual activities have always been private, consensual and discreet. He has never \nsought treatment for sexual addiction nor does he believe he has a problem in this area. \nApplicant has not hired a prostitute for sex since 2019. \nFive performance evaluations of the Applicant for the periods from 2016 through \n2020 are all favorable. Applicant has been rated as either an \u201cExcellent Performer\u201d or a \n\u201cTop Performer\u201d during these rating periods. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a while-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation.  This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of; \n(2) any disruptive, violent or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(d) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.  Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n \n \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country: and  \n \n \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while \nlegal there, is illegal in the United States; and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n(g) association with person involved in criminal activity. \nThere are conditions mitigating security concerns under AG \u00b6 17. However, \nnone of them are applicable here: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with person involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s twelve-year history of sexual misconduct, criminal conduct, and poor \npersonal conduct demonstrates poor judgment, immaturity, and a total disregard for the \nlaw. \nThese violations of the law give rise to serious concerns about Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness, both because of the nature of the offenses, \nand the circumstances surrounding the offenses. Applicant engaged in this conduct in \nthe United States in violation of the law, and in foreign countries without concern or \nregard for the fact that he possessed a DoD security clearance. \nIt is noted that \nApplicant has not engaged in this sexual misconduct for the past two years, however, \ngiven his long history of misconduct, any doubt about a person\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. \nThe before-\nmentioned disqualifying conditions have been established and are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, H, and E, in my whole-person analysis. Based upon the facts and \nanalysis set forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Sexual Behavior, Criminal Conduct and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a. \nAgainst Applicant. \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant. \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a   \nAgainst Applicant \n  Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists seven potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax\nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements. \n \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially applicable as it pertains to the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nto 1.g. Applicant resolved those five debts albeit after the CAF issued her SOR on \nFebruary 17, 2021, almost six years after they were due. The two largest debts totaling \n$22,410 remain unpaid and not resolved. The FORM contains no documented evidence \nthat Applicant made a good-faith effort to resolve these two debts apart from her \nuncorroborated assertions. Good-faith credit cannot be applied to applicants who ignore \ntheir debts to the point where creditors charge them off. Applicant attributes her SOR \ndebts to her separation and divorce; however, her divorce was final in 2015, \napproximately six years ago. She has since remarried in 2018 and bought a house in \n2020. The debts in question were legally incurred, and Applicant is the responsible \nparty. \nIn summary, apart from partial application of AG \u00b6 20(d), no other mitigating \nconditions fully apply. In addition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has been gainfully \nemployed for the majority of her adult life, and she is presumed to be a mature, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nresponsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other information suggesting her long-standing \nfinancial problems are being addressed, doubts remain about her suitability for access \nto classified information. Protection of the national interest is the principal focus of these \nadjudications. Accordingly, those doubts must be resolved against Applicant. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, she failed to \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding her circumstances, articulate her position, and mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. She failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation \nregarding her past efforts to address her outstanding delinquent debt. By failing to \nprovide such information, and in relying on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to \nfully establish mitigation, financial considerations security concerns remain. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c, concerning his use \nand purchase of marijuana while granted access to classified information, though he \nstated that he \u201chandled nothing about FOUO\u201d (i.e., unclassified information marked \u201cFor \nOfficial Use Only.\u201d) (Item 2) \nApplicant did not disclose any drug use on his SCA. During his December 2019 \nbackground interview, he reviewed his responses to the questions on his SCA, and \ndisclosed drug use and drug treatment while in high school in the 1980s. Applicant then \ndisclosed to the interviewing agent that he had a medical marijuana card issued by his \ncurrent state of residence (State 3) and that he used and purchased marijuana on a \nregular basis, for medicinal purposes, to treat his arthritis. Between March 2018 and \nDecember 2019 (the time of the interview), Applicant used marijuana between 7 and 10 \ntimes a week, during which time he held a security clearance. (Item 4 at p. 14-15) \nApplicant indicated that he intended to continue to purchase and use marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes in the future. (Item 4 at p, 15) \nApplicant stated that he did not list this marijuana use on his SCA because it is \nnot illegal under his home state\u2019s law, so he did not believe he had to disclose it. (Item 4 \nat p. 14; Item 3 at 2) Because Applicant\u2019s omission is not alleged under Guideline E, it \nwill not be considered as disqualifying conduct. \nSince January 2018, Applicant has lived in State 3, within commuting distance of \nhis job in State 2. (Item 3 at 9-10) Applicant stated in his Answer to the SOR (Item 2) \nthat when he relocated, he \ndeliberately chose to live in [State 3] to take advantage of their medical \nmarijuana program [citation to state law omitted] such that I do not \n\u2018illegally use illegal drugs.\u2019 I answered truthfully then as now based on my \ninterpretation of this confusion. While I faithfully held a security clearance \nfor over a decade, I felt obligated to take this chance at this time (two \nyears ago, of course), come what may.\u201d  \nApplicant indicated in his February 2021 interrogatory response (by checking \n\u201cNo\u201d) that he had not \u201cengaged in any additional drug use since December 13, 2019,\u201d \nand also that he had not used \u201cANY illegal drug in addition to marijuana.\u201d (Item 4 at 3) \n(Emphasis in original). \nIn his FORM Response, Applicant reaffirmed his views: \n. . .

(FORM Response) Applicant sees his position as within his right to pursue \n\u201cthe physical health and well-being that is an inalienable right of all citizens,\u201d and akin to \nthe \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy regarding homosexual conduct. (FORM Response) \nSince Applicant has raised the matter, I take administrative notice of the fact that \na \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy concerning homosexual conduct by U.S. military service \nmembers was instituted by the Defense Department in the 1990s. Unlike the Defense \nDepartment\u2019s policy position on marijuana, discussed below, the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d \npolicy is no longer in force. \nApplicant offered no additional evidence in his FORM Response beyond his own \nstatements. He did not document his medical diagnosis, his medical need for medicinal \nmarijuana, or his participation in his home state\u2019s medicinal marijuana program. \nNevertheless, I accept his assertions, which the Government did not challenge. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of\nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause\nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with\ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or\npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21\nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline\nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nFurther, in October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a \nmemorandum entitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 \nDNI Memo) which makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, which I am required to follow, has cited the 2014 DNI \nMemo in holding that \u201cstate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited \ncircumstances do not pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the \nDepartment of Defense is not bound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state \nlaw when adjudicating that individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016). \nApplicant has held a security clearance for about 10 years, in connection with his \nemployment with various defense contractors. Between about March 2018 and mid-\nDecember 2019, he purchased marijuana on a regular basis and used marijuana \nseveral times a week, for medical purposes to help alleviate the pain from his medical \ncondition. He did so through his home state\u2019s medical-marijuana program. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) \nand 25(f) therefore apply. Whether Applicant actually handled classified information, or \nonly handled unclassified information marked \u201cFOUO\u201d does not matter.

He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.d, which \nalleged that he intended to continue using marijuana in the future. In his FORM \nResponse, he reaffirmed his belief that he does not \u201cillegally use illegal drugs,\u201d does not \n\u201cillegally use drugs,\u201d and does not \u201cuse illegal drugs,\u201d but has \u201conly engaged in medical \ntherapy in private, after-hours settings.\u201d I therefore infer that his medical marijuana use \nhas continued. At the very least, he failed \u201cto clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue\u201d his medical marijuana use AG \u00b6 25(g) therefore applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is frequent, recent and likely ongoing, and he stated \nan intention to continue using marijuana as treatment of his chronic medical condition. \nThe fact that his use is legal under his home state\u2019s law is not mitigating when his \ninvolvement with marijuana, a Schedule 1 controlled substance, continues to violate \nfederal law. As such, Applicant\u2019s pattern and use of medical marijuana continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment with respect to his \nsuitability for a DOD security clearance. He has neither established a pattern of \nabstinence or changed circumstances, nor clearly stated an intent to abstain from \nmarijuana use in the future. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b) do not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is merely a cross-allegation of the drug involvement allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. The personal conduct general concern (AG \u00b6 15) is established \ngiven that Applicant\u2019s admitted conduct establishes his questionable judgment and his \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. While the Government did not address \nGuideline E in its FORM, and the cross-allegation is largely redundant and \nunnecessary, the resulting personal conduct security concerns are also unmitigated for \nthe same reasons as set forth under Guideline H. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has a long career in the defense industry, and is highly educated. He \nhas a debilitating, chronic medical condition that he has chosen to treat with medical \nmarijuana, through his state\u2019s lawful medical marijuana program, despite holding a \nsecurity clearance. \nIndeed, Applicant specifically chose to move to State 3 to take advantage of their \nmedical marijuana program. There is no evidence, however, that he sought advice or \ninformation from appropriate industrial security authorities, who might have advised him \nof the illegal nature, under Federal law, of his intended plan. Instead, he has operated \nunder significant misconceptions of his rights and responsibilities as a federal security \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nclearance holder. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant references his possession of a \nsecurity clearance, and also notes that he \u201cfelt obligated to take this chance\u201d and use \nmedical marijuana. This suggests he may have been aware of the requirements of a \nclearance holder under federal law, and consciously decided to disregard them anyway.  \nApplicant seeks renewal of a security clearance with the U.S. Department of \nDefense, and marijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance under federal law. \nEven though his marijuana use, for purely medical purposes, is legal under his home \nstate\u2019s law, he has a recent history and pattern of disregarding federal law in using \nmarijuana. \nI therefore cannot find that Applicant has met his burden of showing that he has \nfully mitigated the security concerns set forth by his pattern of recent purchases and use \nof marijuana for medical purposes and his intention to continue such use in the future. I \nconclude Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns \nabout his drug involvement and substance misuse. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 28 years old and earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2015. Applicant has been employed by her current sponsor since August 2019. She is single and has no children. (Item 3) Following graduation in May 2015, Applicant began work as a systems engineer for a federal contractor. In her four interim and annual appraisals for 2017 and 2018, her supervisor repeatedly counseled and cautioned Applicant concerning her failure to maintain a consistent and predictable work schedule. In Applicant\u2019s 2018 final appraisal, received and acknowledged by Applicant in February 2019, her supervisor specifically cautioned that Applicant must maintain a work schedule \u201cper (the company\u2019s) timekeeping policy,\u201d and that a failure to maintain a consistent schedule \u201ccould lead to disciplinary action.\u201d (Item 4) In June 2019, Applicant\u2019s manager reported to the company\u2019s human resources (HR) office that Applicant was not present in their secure work space on numerous days in May and June 2019 and that he suspected she may be mischarging her hours.

Items \n1 through 4 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on September 9, \n2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old and earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2015. Applicant \nhas been employed by her current sponsor since August 2019. She is single and has no \nchildren. (Item 3) \nFollowing graduation in May 2015, Applicant began work as a systems engineer \nfor a federal contractor. In her four interim and annual appraisals for 2017 and 2018, her \nsupervisor repeatedly counseled and cautioned Applicant concerning her failure to \nmaintain a consistent and predictable work schedule. In Applicant\u2019s 2018 final appraisal, \nreceived and acknowledged by Applicant in February 2019, her supervisor specifically \ncautioned that Applicant must maintain a work schedule \u201cper (the company\u2019s) \ntimekeeping policy,\u201d and that a failure to maintain a consistent schedule \u201ccould lead to \ndisciplinary action.\u201d (Item 4) \nIn June 2019, Applicant\u2019s manager reported to the company\u2019s human resources \n(HR) office that Applicant was not present in their secure work space on numerous days \nin May and June 2019 and that he suspected she may be mischarging her hours. The HR \noffice, in concert with the company\u2019s security office and ethics office, conducted a badge-\nswipe audit of external doors and internal doors for the period from May 1, 2019, through \nJune 21, 2019. The audit revealed 24 days for which Applicant\u2019s timesheet did not align \nwith her badge swipes. On nine days, the badge-swipe audit indicated that Applicant was \nnot in the facility at all, although she had submitted timesheets claiming that she had \nworked nine-hour days. On another 15 occasions, Applicant recorded hours on her \ntimesheet that exceeded her initial entry into and final exit from the building. \nIn July 2019, representatives from HR and Ethics met with Applicant to review their \nconcerns. Applicant initially maintained that she worked full 40-hour weeks, but later in \nthe interview acknowledged that she had not worked full 40-hour weeks for several \nmonths. When confronted with the audit and asked to explain the days without any badge \nswipes at all, Applicant initially suggested that she may have \u201cpiggy-backed\u201d into the \nfacility (i.e., following another employee who swiped in), but then agreed that the audit \nshould reflect additional badge swipes throughout the day, as she would need to badge \nin and out of the secure work area. Ultimately, Applicant offered no plausible explanation \nfor the discrepancies between her timesheet and the badge-swipe audit. When asked \npoint-blank whether she had falsified her timesheet, Applicant responded, \u201cI can\u2019t think of \nany reason why I would.\u201d (Item 4) The interviewers concluded that Applicant had \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nmischarged at least 85 hours over the seven-week period and that she was not truthful \nduring her interview. They recommended termination, and Applicant was terminated the \nfollowing week. (Item 4) The SOR alleges, and Applicant admits, that Applicant \nmischarged over 100 hours of labor, vice 85. I find the difference not consequential for \nmy analysis or decision. \nThe allegation is established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the employer\u2019s internal \ninvestigation. (Items 2 and 4). In Applicant\u2019s May 2021 answer to the SOR, she expresses \nremorse for \u201cserious ethical mistakes.\u201d She notes that she was \u201cinexperienced and \nunderchallenged\u201d at her prior employer, but acknowledges that there was no justification \nfor her actions that led to the termination. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant was terminated for submitting fraudulent timesheets. Her conduct \nreflects questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. Notably, an audit of only 37 work days revealed nine \ndays in which Applicant claimed to have worked, but did not, and 15 other days in which \nshe \u201cpadded\u201d her hours to some extent. This was not a one-time occurrence, or an \noccasional occurrence, but a clear pattern of fraudulent timesheets and misuse of her \nemployer\u2019s resources. Moreover, Applicant had been cautioned in a formal appraisal just \nthree months earlier that continued absences and timekeeping problems could lead to \ndisciplinary action. (Item 4) In the wake of this counseling, her multiple absences in May \nand June 2019 signal a recklessness that is incompatible with access to classified \ninformation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable to this workplace misconduct. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nDuring her interview with representatives from HR and the ethics office, Applicant \ndid not take the opportunity to be forthright about the mischarged hours or to accept \nresponsibility. Instead, the team concluded that she was not truthful. The behavior that \nresulted in her termination is fairly recent, not minor, repeated, and not under any unique \ncircumstances. That conduct continues to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. The above \nmitigating factors, individually or collectively, are insufficient to dispel the personal \nconduct security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s expression of remorse in her Answer to the \nSOR, but it is insufficient to overcome the incidents that led to her termination, which \ninvolve questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
