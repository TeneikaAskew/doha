Edmunds, Esquire \n \n06/14/2019 \n          \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \n \n                                        Statement of the Case \n \nOn October 29, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. On \nNovember 27, 2018, Applicant timely submitted a response in which the allegations \nunder Guideline G were admitted, the sole allegation raised under Guideline J was \ndenied in part, and a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) was requested.  \n \nOn February 20, 2019, I was assigned the case. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 22, 2019, setting the hearing \nfor May 9, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered five documents, accepted without objection as exhibits \n(Exs.) 1-5, as well as one hearing exhibit, noted as Ex I. Applicant offered testimony, \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \npresented four witnesses, and 19 documents, accepted without objection as Exs. A-S.  \nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on May 21, 2019, and the record was closed. Based \non the exhibits, testimony, and record as a whole, I find Applicant mitigated the alcohol \nconsumption security concern and criminal conduct security concerns raised.   \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old contractor who has been in that position working for \nthe same employer since 2015. He is a high school graduate who obtained his \nundergraduate degree in 1997, and his Master\u2019s degree in 2014. (Exs. B, D) He is \nmarried and has six children. He completed a security clearance application in 2016. He \nhas previously held a security clearance for about 15 years. (GX 1) \n \n \nIn December 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and \npossession of an open container. (1.c) He had left a night club and was stopped for an \nerratic lane change. He pled not guilty and the charge was dismissed for lack of \nsufficient evidence. (GX 5, AX K) Applicant attended alcohol counseling classes. He \nreturned to social drinking after a period of time. (Tr. 61) \n \n \n  In February 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI (first offense). \nHe was found guilty of the charge, and as a result, was ordered to attend state alcohol \nsafety action classes, and his driver\u2019s license was restricted for a period of one year. \n(1.b) He paid $275 in fines. Applicant left a bar, but did not feel intoxicated. He \nacknowledged that he had three to four cocktails. (GX 2)  \n \n \nDuring his 2018 investigative interview, Applicant stated that he first drank \nalcohol at age 19 or 20, on the weekends at parties. He usually drank beer.  He told the \ninvestigator that he drank at that time at home once a month. He also stated that he \nwould not drink and drive again. (Investigative Interview) \n \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI\u2013second offense in \nfive years. He pled guilty to the DWI and as a result he was ordered to attend state \nalcohol safety action programs, which he completed. (AX I) His driver\u2019s license was \nrestricted until October 2018. (1.a) He admits that he made a poor choice that night. He \nwas leaving a friend\u2019s house, and he believes he had three drinks. (Tr. 51) At the \nhearing, Applicant acknowledged that the 2013 incident did not leave him with the \nunderstanding of the magnitude of getting behind the wheel of a car after drinking. (Tr. \n52) He had an ignition interlock system in place. On one occasion, he blew positive, but \nit was not from drinking but rather from mouthwash. (Tr. 73) \n \n \nSince 2017, Applicant has not had a drink. (Tr. 52) He realized after the \ncompletion of 15 weeks of counseling with an LCSW and the treatment assessment \nreport that noted his involvement with AA and men\u2019s groups, combined with abstinence \nthat he did have a problem with alcohol which was something that was indeed impacting \nhis life and needed to change. (Tr. 53, AX N) He submitted the monthly progress reports \nfrom the treatment sessions. Each one noted that Applicant was in full compliance with \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nthe plan. (AX L) His conversations with others, such as his father and wife, convinced \nhim that he had to abstain from drinking.  (Tr. 53) He wants to support his family and \nwithout a security clearance, he could not continue to get federal contract positions.  \n \n \nApplicant signed a Letter of Intent in November 2018. (AX G) He signed an \nupdated Letter of Intent in April 2019. (AX Q) He was credible in his testimony that he \nnever drank at work or had any security violations during his career. (Tr. 54) Another \nmotivation to abstain from alcohol is the fact that he lost a five year contract due to the \nalcohol issues. He still attends AA meetings. He has been attending those meetings \ntwice a week since 2017. (Tr. 77) \n \n \nSince the 2017 DWI, Applicant has had no additional brushes with the law. He \nrecognizes that his troubles were based on poor judgment that needed to be improved. \nDuring counseling, he totally refrained from alcohol. He made a pledge to himself and \nhis family to abstain from the use of alcohol in the future. He signed two letters of intent. \nApplicant came to grips with alcohol use as a problem in his life. He has had two \nconvictions in his entire adult life. His family supports him. Applicant\u2019s driving privilege \nhas been restored.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal circle of friends has been reduced and he no longer \nsocializes as much with those with whom he used to once abuse alcohol, preferring to \nassociate with a more professional crowd. At present, he is excelling at work and \nlooking to continue with his challenging position. \n \nApplicant presented four witnesses who have known him for many years and are \naware of the SOR allegations. Each stated that Applicant is a man of integrity and is \ndedicated to his family. (Tr. 19-25) One witness noted that Applicant is a changed man \nand believes he is credible that Applicant will not drink in the future. (Tr. 27) Applicant\u2019s \nfather, who has held a security clearance, testified that Applicant was forthright with him \nand they have had conversations concerning the alcohol driving incidents. He has not \nseen his son drink in at least two years. (Tr. 34) Applicant\u2019s father stated that his son \nhad no issues with drinking prior to the arrests. Applicant\u2019s wife of 12 years testified that \nshe holds a security clearance and is aware of the alcohol arrests and convictions. She \nmaintains that there is no alcohol in the home and that she does not drink. As to \nApplicant, her husband, she is convinced that he has learned a lesson from the \nincidents and realizes that he has put his family in jeopardy. She told him she was \ndisappointed in him and that he has to be a role model for the children. (Tr. 42) She \nknows that he is ashamed of his previous behavior. Applicant lost his clearance due to \nthe second alcohol incident. \n \nApplicant submitted nine letters of recommendation. Each letter states that \nApplicant is an upstanding citizen.  He is described as an outstanding leader and a \ntrustworthy and reliable individual. (AX A) \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. The AG \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \nThe Alcohol Consumption guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nApplicant\u2019s three alcohol-related arrests in 2010, 2013, and 2017 resulted in two \nconvictions and one dismissal. This demonstrate his excessive use of alcohol and \nrelated poor judgment. They, therefore, establish the following disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline could potentially be mitigated \nby the following applicable factors:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment \nprogram along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations.  \n \nApplicant was cited three times for drinking and driving within a seven year \nperiod, with his last in 2017. Both were the result of attending activities where it could be \npresumed alcohol would be imbibed, and predicted that driving home would conclude \nthe evening. Applicant acknowledges his poor judgment and takes responsibility for his \nactions. He has completed an alcohol and drug counseling program, 15 sessions of \ncounseling and still attends AA.   \n \nApplicant stopped drinking in 2017. He has come to grips with alcohol \nconsumption as an issue impacting his family and his life. He has signed two letters of \nintent. These efforts show promise. At least a year free of drinking seems to be a \nreasonable period or benchmark upon which to best assess that Applicant is fully in \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \ncontrol of his use of alcohol and capable of responsible judgment.  AG \u00b6 23(b and d) \napply.  \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant drinking and driving convictions in 2013 and 2017 establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin 6 combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the following \napplicable factor: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \nApplicant is genuinely contrite over his past criminal offenses. He has completed \nappropriate alcohol and drug counseling, attends AA, changed his professional focus \nand personal circle of friends, abstains from alcohol consumption, matured, and \nforesworn driving after drinking. He has settled down with his wife and family. Applicant \ncompleted all court-ordered requirements and has had no further incidents. He has \nexcellent references. Such accomplishments demonstrate that he is now ready to go \nforward living his life in compliance with laws and regulations.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under the two \napplicable guidelines in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s highly \ncredible testimony, background, age, behavioral changes, and subsequent maturation. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me assured that this conduct will not recur.  I \nfound him credible. He has supported his wife and family for many years. He attends AA \nand goes to church. He sought the advice of his father and wife who support him and \nhave made it clear to him that if he continued on his former path, he would lose his \nfamily.  He has many excellent references. He has never had a security violation or \nincident of alcohol at work. I have no questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance vis-\u00e0-vis alcohol consumption. The evidence \npersuades me that Applicant has matured sufficiently to comport his behavior with \napplicable laws and regulations. Consequently, I conclude alcohol consumption security \nconcerns and criminal conduct concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \n         Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nNoreen A.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 9, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On August 27, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n01/30/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear as to when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the \ncase file. In a sworn statement, dated September 29, 2018, Applicant responded to the \nSOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 22, 2018, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on November 15, 2018. Applicant\u2019s response was due on December 15, 2018. \nApplicant apparently chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of January 28, 2019, he \nhad not done so. The case was assigned to me on January 25, 2019.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted without comments nearly all of the \nfactual allegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.j., 1.l. through 1.n., and 1.p.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a senior administrative logistics analyst with his current employer since October 2015. \nHe was with the same employer, in a different position (warehouse administrator) and \nlocation from June 2013 until June 2014.

Applicant used his savings and various credit cards to \npay his bills, and he cashed out his 401(k), but failed to properly report his actions, \nresulting in increased state and federal taxes.2 It appears that most of his accounts \nbecame delinquent in 2015. Two other actions by Applicant have had a negative impact \non his financial situation: in October 2014, he loaned a girlfriend $6,850, but she has \nrefused to pay him back, and he does not anticipate her doing so; and in 2014, he leased \na 2014 luxury sedan for a monthly payment of $599. \n \nOn August 19, 2015, in a seemingly tactical effort to save his residence from \nforeclosure, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. \nHe listed assets worth $356,712, including real property worth $348,127; liabilities worth \n$480,576. Included in that amount were $320,987 in secured claims ($285,012 mortgage \nlien, $35,975 for a vehicle lease; $17,629 in unsecured nonpriority claims ($1,256 in state \ntaxes, and $16,373 in federal taxes); and $141,960 in unsecured nonpriority claims \n(various consumer accounts, including credit cards).3 At the time of his bankruptcy filing, \nhe reported a net monthly income of $5,681;4 $5,116 in expenses; and a remainder of \n$565 available for saving or spending.5 By April 3, 2017, the bankruptcy trustee disbursed \na total of $7,035, including $2,861 for administration expenses, and $4,174 to two \ncreditors combined.6 No further disbursements were made to any of the remaining \ncreditors because, on April 3, 2017, Applicant moved to dismiss his bankruptcy case. An \norder was issued dismissing the case and vacating all automatic stays and injunctions.7  \nIn addition to his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the SOR identified 15 delinquent \naccounts that had been placed for collection or charged off as generally reflected by \nApplicant\u2019s December 2017 or June 2018 credit reports. For the vast majority of the debts, \nApplicant acknowledged that he had made no effort to resolve the accounts since his \nChapter 13 bankruptcy was cancelled.8 Those debts, most of which were charged off, \ntotaling approximately $173,797, are described below: \n (SOR \u00b6 1.a., automobile lease for $28,835 on a vehicle that was repossessed); \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b., credit card for $26,717); (SOR \u00b6 1.c., credit card for $26,581); (SOR \u00b6 1.d., \ncredit card for $25,881); (SOR \u00b6 1.e., credit card for $17,651); (SOR \u00b6 1.f., credit card for \n$8,535); (SOR \u00b6 1.g., credit card for $8,266);  (SOR \u00b6 1.h., credit card for $5,678); (SOR \n                                                          \n2 Item 4, supra note 1, at 10. \n \n3 Item 7 (Bankruptcy Court File, various dates). \n \n4 Item 7 (Schedule I: Your Income, dated August 19, 2015). \n \n5 Item 7 (Schedule J: Your Expenses). \n \n6 Item 7 (Trustee\u2019s Final Report and Account, dated June 5, 2017). \n \n7 Item 7, supra note 3. \n \n8 Item 4, supra note 1. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n\u00b6 1.i., credit card for $3,808); (SOR \u00b6 1.j., line of credit for $2,489); (SOR \u00b6 1.k., credit \ncard for $1,056); (SOR \u00b6 1.l., medical account for $67); (SOR \u00b6 1.m., cellular phone \naccount for $604); (SOR \u00b6 1.o., federal taxes for $16,373 of which there was a partial \npayment of $2,261.64 as part of the bankruptcy); and (SOR \u00b6 1.p., state taxes for $1,256 \nthat was actually paid off as part of the bankruptcy).9  \nApplicant claimed that his financial situation was \u201cmuch better,\u201d and while he has \nnot made any efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts, he is purportedly able to pay his \ncurrent bills.10 He denied having received any financial counseling or debt consolidation \nservices, but did indicate that he was looking into hiring a credit management company \nto assist him in paying his debts. However, as of January 2018, he had not yet done so.11 \nApplicant failed to indicate his current monthly net pay, monthly expenses, debt \npayments, or if he has any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary \nspending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. In January 2018, the OPM \ninvestigator requested documentation associated with Applicant\u2019s accounts, and in \nOctober 2018, Department Counsel noted that Applicant still had not provided any \n\u201cdocumentary evidence proving that he has paid, is on a current repayment plan for, has \nsettled, or otherwise resolved any of his delinquent or charged off accounts.\u201d That status \nremains unchanged. Other than his general oral statements, Applicant offered no \nevidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that it is now under \ncontrol.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d12 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d13   \n \n                                                          \n9 Item 5, supra note 1, at 6-10, 18; Item 6, supra note 1, at 2-3, 5; Item 4, supra note 1, at 6-11. \n \n10 Item 4, supra note 1, at 9-10. \n11 Item 4, supra note 1, at 10. It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises \nto pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely \nmanner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. \nSep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n12 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n13 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d14 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.15  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d16  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d17 Thus, nothing in this \n                                                          \n14 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n15 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n16 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n17 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; and \n \n                                                          \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n  \nIn addition to his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the SOR identified 15 delinquent \naccounts, totaling approximately $173,797, which had been placed for collection or \ncharged off. Other than the now-cancelled bankruptcy effort, 14 of those delinquent \naccounts remain unresolved, with Applicant making no effort to resolve them, despite \nbeing fully employed since June 2013. His frivolous or irresponsible spending resulted in \nmaking an unsecured $6,850 loan to a girlfriend and leasing a 2014 luxury vehicle for \n$599 per month. At the time he filed for bankruptcy, more in an effort to save his residence \nfrom foreclosure than to pay his debts, Applicant had a monthly remainder of $565 \navailable for saving or spending, yet he ignored delinquent debts of $67 and $604. He \nclaimed having an inability to meet his financial obligations over a period of years, and it \nappears that his avoidance of his financial obligations is associated with somewhat limited \nfunds, irresponsible spending, and an unwillingness to satisfy his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(b), 19(c), 19(e), and 19(f) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;18 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;19  \n                                                          \n18 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \n19 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAs to Applicant\u2019s state tax debt, which was satisfied under the bankruptcy, AG \u00b6 \n20(g) applies. AG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the remaining mitigating \nconditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties make it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d \nor that it is \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to his one period \nof unemployment (October 2012 until June 2013), and insufficient funds to maintain his \nfinancial responsibilities. However, during his periods of unemployment, Applicant still \nhad income from other sources. There is no documentation to reflect that Applicant made \nany efforts, much less \u201cgood-faith\u201d efforts, before or after he was interviewed by OPM; \nafter the bankruptcy was dismissed in April 2017; before or after the SOR was issued in \nAugust 2018; or even after he was sent the FORM in October 2018, to: obtain financial \ncounseling from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice; dispute his delinquent accounts with the credit reporting agencies or the creditors \nthemselves; contact his creditors to set up repayment plans; or indicate that payments \nhad been made to his creditors.20  \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests.21 In this instance, to date, with the limited exception of \nthe trustee\u2019s payments regarding the state taxes and a portion of his federal tax debts, \nthere is no evidence that any corrective actions have been taken by Applicant. There is \nno evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s finances are under control. \n                                                          \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n20 See ISCR Case No. 12-01335 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017). \n \n21 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.22  \n  \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 41-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor, serving as a senior administrative logistics analyst \nwith his current employer since October 2015. He served in an enlisted capacity with the \nU.S. Navy from March 1996 until he was honorably discharged in January 2007. He was \ngranted a top secret clearance in 2008. Because of a layoff, he was unemployed from \nOctober 2012 until June 2013. After filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in August \n2015, the bankruptcy trustee paid off Applicant\u2019s state tax debt and a portion of his federal \ntax debt. \n  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant had 15 delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off, \n                                                          \n22 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \ntotaling $173,797. In an apparent tactical effort to save his residence from foreclosure, \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13, but once the fear of foreclosure \ndisappeared, he cancelled the bankruptcy in April 2017. Since the bankruptcy was \ndismissed nearly two years ago, Applicant has made no efforts to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. Applicant has not obtained financial counseling. There is no evidence of a budget, \nand he offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that it \nis now under control. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:23 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor, if not non-existent, track record of \ndebt reduction and elimination efforts, seemingly avoiding nearly all of the debts in his \nname. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.

Applicant responded to the SOR on \nDecember 18, 2018. On January 2, 2019, he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 4, 2019.  \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non April 18, 2019, scheduling the hearing for May 29, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \n \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2014. He previously worked for the same employer from \n2008 to 2009 and 2010 to 2012. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has \nheld since about 2008. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 2009. He \nmarried and divorced in 2010. He married again in 2014. He has two children. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 17-19, 38-41; GE 1; AE D) \n \nApplicant regularly used marijuana from about 2010 through November 2013 \nwhile holding a security clearance. His brother was a marijuana user and lived with him \nduring that period. Applicant\u2019s father moved in with them in about 2012. His father \nsuffers from mental illness, dementia, and possibly post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD) from his service in Vietnam. His father engaged in erratic behavior, including \nexposing himself. Applicant stated that he and his brother were under a great deal of \nstress from caring for his father, which significantly contributed to their marijuana use. \n(Tr. at 38-39, 46-50, 62-67, 75; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1)  \n \nApplicant provided an inconsistent history of his marijuana use. He reported his \nmarijuana use on his February 2015 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF \n86). He wrote that he periodically used marijuana as a \u201cstress reliever,\u201d with the first use \nin 1998 and the most recent use in \u201c08/2012 (Estimated).\u201d In response to DOHA \ninterrogatories, he wrote that he used marijuana monthly from 1998 to 2000; no use \nfrom 2000 to 2010; and weekly from 2010 to 2013. Upon his hospitalization, as \ndiscussed below, he reported that he was smoking marijuana on a daily basis. He \ntestified that he started using marijuana regularly in 2013, then later admitted that he \nsmoked marijuana with his brother since 2010. He stated that he used it on a weekly \nbasis, and then admitted using it almost daily in 2013. There is no evidence of any \nillegal drug use after his hospitalization in 2013. He signed a statement of intent to \nabstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr. at 50-\n51, 62-63, 66, 75; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, enclosure (encl) 4; GE 1, 2)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant stated that any discrepancies about his marijuana use were due to his \nbad memory. He asserted that his memory problems could be from head trauma he \nsuffered when he was younger during gymnastics and wrestling. He also believes it \ncould be associated with stress and his attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \n(Tr. at 63-64). \n \nApplicant was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility on November 24, 2013. \nHe was accompanied by his family. His family told the staff that he had expressed \nsuicidal ideation. During his intake interview, it was reported that he was cooperative, \nbut it was also reported that he was \u201cvery grossly psychotic and delusional, \ndisorganized, loose, incoherent, [and] making bizarre statements.\u201d He had been running \nin the streets and entering the homes of strangers without permission. The admission \ndiagnosis by a psychiatrist was bipolar affective disorder, not otherwise specified, \ncurrently depressed with psychosis and in acute exacerbation; and marijuana abuse, \nintermittent. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \n \nApplicant was placed on medication. His mood stabilized, and his thoughts were \nmore composed. He was motivated to seek outpatient counseling and to take his \nmedications. He was discharged home to resume outpatient care on December 2, 2013. \nUpon his discharge \u201cno suicidal thoughts [were] noted; [and] no psychosis [was] noted.\u201d \nThe discharge diagnosis by the attending psychiatrist was bipolar affective disorder, not \notherwise specified, currently manic with psychosis; and marijuana abuse, severe. \n(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \n \nApplicant continued to be seen by the psychiatrist for a period after his \ndischarge, and he continued with his medication. He did not feel that the medication \nwas necessary, and he discontinued seeing the psychiatrist and taking the medication \nin about 2014. He stated that the psychiatrist wanted him to continue with the \nmedication, but he did not feel that she was listening to him; that she was not acting in \nhis best interest; and that \u201cshe didn\u2019t truly care about [him] as a patient.\u201d (Tr. at 68-71; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR) \n \nApplicant was evaluated at the DOD\u2019s request by a licensed clinical psychologist \nin February 2017. The diagnosis was bipolar I disorder, current episode, hypomanic; \nand cannabis use disorder, in prolonged remission. The prognosis was \u201c[p]oor, without \ntreatment compliance.\u201d The psychologist wrote:  \n \nI expressed to [Applicant] that I believed that his diagnosis from the \nhospital was probably correct, and that it would be wise to consider \nreturning to his psychiatrist for follow-up treatment. His face immediately \nfell, and he became serious and sad for the only time in the interview. He \nwas not convinced that he did indeed have a mental health problem that \ncould compromise his judgment, but stated that he would return to see his \npsychiatrist for medication. However, because hypomanic episodes are \npleasant and enjoyable, especially relative to medicated states, \ncompliance with medication is often poor early in the disorder, just as it \nhas been with [Applicant]. Until he has demonstrated a good track record \n\n \n4 \n \nof compliance with treatment, he is at risk for another manic episode, \nduring which his judgment and reliability will be severely impaired. (GE 4) \n \nApplicant does not agree with the diagnosis. He feels the psychologist rushed the \nevaluation. He has received regular counseling from a licensed clinical social worker \nsince April 2018. He was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, unspecified. (Tr. at 44, \n52-59, 71-74) The LCSW reported: \n \nIn my observation of [Applicant] over the past several months I see no \nreason he should not continue to work at his present job and continue to \nfunction at a high-level. I see no reason from my sessions and interaction \nwith [Applicant] that a security clearance should be revoked and do not \nthink he poses a risk to national security. . . . I see no evidence of the \npsychotic episode or bipolar affective disorder, depression or psychosis. \n[Applicant] has not been taking medications according to the records since \n2014 and it has not been indicated since I have been working with him \nsince April of 2018. I have not needed to refer [Applicant] for a medication \nconsult for bipolar disorder or any other psychiatric diagnosis since I\u2019ve \nbeen seeing him. I have seen [Applicant] several times a month since \nApril, 2018. I believe he is emotionally stable and is an asset to his work \nplace and [is] a productive team member. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, \nencl 5) \n \nApplicant sought his own evaluation from a psychologist and a licensed clinical \npsychologist in October 2018. They diagnosed him with adjustment disorder, \nunspecified. They recommended therapy, stimulating self-care activities, a healthy diet, \nregular exercise, and a proper amount of sleep in order to promote a more even mood \nand better focus. The evaluation further noted: \n \nIt is plausible that [Applicant] may have been experiencing significantly \ndistressing thoughts and feelings associated with anxiety and panic when \nhe was hospitalized in 2013 due to situational stressors at that time, \nhowever his functional abilities across domains seem to be considerably \nstable in recent years. [Applicant] may be experiencing some symptoms of \nanxiety related to his current adjudicative proceedings, however not to a \nclinical or otherwise abnormal level compared to other individuals in his \nage category. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, encl 6)  \n \n \nApplicant married in 2014 and has two young children. His father and brother \nmoved out in about 2014. His father is living in an assisted living facility. There is no \nevidence of recurrence of psychotic or delusional behavior. He is an active member of \nhis church. He has received guidance and counseling through his church, and his faith \nhas played a significant role in his development. His wife does not believe he is bipolar, \nand she has seen no evidence of erratic behavior. She described Applicant as calm, \neven-keel, and a very peaceful person. (Tr. at 37-46, 55-56, 71, 75) \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant called witnesses and presented documents and letters attesting to his \nstrong moral character and outstanding job performance. He is praised for his emotional \nstability, character, trustworthiness, and honesty. (Tr. at 16-36; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n6 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions.  \n \nApplicant was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility in November 2013. It \nwas reported that he was \u201cvery grossly psychotic and delusional, disorganized, loose, \nincoherent, [and] making bizarre statements.\u201d He had been running in the streets and \n\n \n7 \n \nentering the homes of strangers without permission. AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(c) are \napplicable. \n \nApplicant was placed on medication at the hospital. His mood stabilized, his \nthoughts were more composed, and he was discharged to outpatient care with no \npsychosis noted. He continued to be seen by the psychiatrist for a period after his \ndischarge, and he continued with his medication for a period. The psychiatrist wanted \nhim to continue with the medication, but Applicant did not feel that the medication was \nnecessary, and he discontinued seeing the psychiatrist and taking the medication in \nabout 2014. AG \u00b6 28(d) has some applicability. However, Applicant is currently following \nthe medical advice of the LCSW and the psychiatrist who performed the evaluation. \nFurthermore, without direct evidence from the treating psychiatrist, it is difficult for me to \nconclude that the psychiatrist did not at least reluctantly go along with the decision to \ncease medication. SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \n \nApplicant was evaluated at the DOD\u2019s request by a licensed clinical psychologist \nin February 2017. The diagnosis was bipolar I disorder, current episode, hypomanic; \nand cannabis use disorder, in prolonged remission. The prognosis was \u201c[p]oor, without \ntreatment compliance.\u201d The psychologist also opined that until Applicant \u201chas \ndemonstrated a good track record of compliance with treatment, he is at risk for another \nmanic episode, during which his judgment and reliability will be severely impaired.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n28(b) is applicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAt the outset, it is noted that Applicant\u2019s drug abuse and mental health issues \ncannot be considered in a vacuum or in a piecemeal manner. They have some \nconnectivity, both in their effect on Applicant, and in addressing mitigation of security \nconcerns. There is no evidence of recurrence of psychotic or delusional behavior or \nillegal drug abuse since the 2013 hospitalization. Applicant has received counseling \nfrom an LCSW since April 2018. He received his own evaluation from a psychologist \nand a licensed clinical psychologist. Both the LCSW and the psychologists diagnosed \nhim with adjustment disorder, unspecified, with no significant concerns about his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant presented lay testimony to his \nemotional stability and excellent job performance.  \n \nI give greater weight to the diagnosis at the hospital of bipolar affective disorder, \nnot otherwise specified, currently manic with psychosis, and the diagnosis during the \nDOD-requested evaluation of bipolar I disorder, current episode, hypomanic. Those \ndiagnoses account for the psychotic and delusional behavior identified when Applicant \nwas hospitalized. Conversely, I am unable to reconcile the diagnoses of adjustment \ndisorder, unspecified, with that behavior. I find that Applicant has not rebutted the \nfindings in the psychological evaluation. None of the above mitigating conditions, \nindividually or collectively, are sufficient to alleviate psychological conditions security \nconcerns. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n\n \n9 \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana from about 2010 through November 2013 while holding \na security clearance. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly \napplicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under \nthe drug involvement and substance misuse guideline. However, the general concerns \nabout questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established for the marijuana use.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the three psychological conditions allegations as \npersonal conduct. Applicant\u2019s psychological issues do not generate personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nThere is no evidence of illegal drug use after Applicant\u2019s hospitalization in \nNovember 2013. I nonetheless have lingering concerns. Applicant chose to violate the \nlaw, sometimes on a daily basis, while holding a security clearance. I am also \nconcerned about the lack of clarity and inconsistent accounts of his marijuana use. \nEither from poor memory or intentional obfuscation, I am not confident that I know the \nfull extent of his drug use. The conduct continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The mitigating information is insufficient to mitigate \nall the personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and I in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana regularly, and sometimes on a daily basis, while \nholding a security clearance. He had a psychotic episode in November 2013, requiring \nhis hospitalization. His treating psychiatrist and the psychologist who performed the \nevaluation at the DOD\u2019s request both diagnosed him with bipolar disorder. The \nprognosis was \u201c[p]oor, without treatment compliance.\u201d The psychologist also opined that \nuntil Applicant \u201chas demonstrated a good track record of compliance with treatment, he \nis at risk for another manic episode, during which his judgment and reliability will be \nseverely impaired.\u201d I also considered the lay testimony and the opinions of the LCSW \nand the psychologists who evaluated Applicant at his request. However, the protection \nof the national security is the paramount consideration. It is required that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and psychological conditions security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n07/09/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \n \nThe psychological evaluation which led to the Statement of Reasons does not \nestablish that Applicant has a current psychological condition that impacts his judgment, \nreliability or trustworthiness. Nor is his alleged failure to comply with recommended \ntreatment and medication found to be a security concern. Security concerns under \nGuideline I, psychological conditions, are not established. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 13, 2013. \nOn September 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline I, psychological conditions. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD as of June 8, \n2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 11, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The case \nwas assigned to me on January 3, 2019. On February 1, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing was issued scheduling the case for February 20, 2019.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified. He did not provide any exhibits as part of his case. I left the record \nopen to allow him the opportunity to submit additional evidence. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on March 6, 2019. \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant timely submitted one document, which was marked as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A and admitted without objection. AE A concerned his medical \ntreatment. Upon reviewing AE A, I reopened the record, first until April 19, 2019, and then \nuntil June 21, 2019, to allow Applicant the opportunity to supplement the record. Applicant \nresponded by e-mail on each occasion with some additional information, but did not \notherwise provide updated documentation. His e-mails, on March 20, 2019 and June 13, \n2019, are marked as AE B and AE C, and admitted. Other post-hearing e-mails are \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit III. The record closed on June 21, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e) without comment. \nI have incorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony and the exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 26 years old. He is not married and has no children. He graduated \nfrom high school in 2011. Since June 2013, he has worked at a naval shipyard for a \ndefense contractor. (SCA) He previously had an interim clearance, but does not hold a \nclearance currently. He earns about $27 an hour. (Tr. 16, 27, 49) \n \n \nThe SOR concerns allegations that Applicant has a history of diagnosed \npsychological conditions and has failed to follow the treatment recommendations of \nmedical professionals in addressing them responsibly, resulting in a poor prognosis. \n \nIn March 2018, in connection with the adjudication of his clearance application, \nApplicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist (Ph.D.) at the DOD CAF\u2019s \nrequest, to determine if Applicant had any mental, emotional, or personality conditions \nthat could impair his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. The evaluation also \naddressed Applicant\u2019s history of irresponsible behavior and his problems with impulse \ncontrol, including a police record and delinquent debts. (GE 2) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn the summary of the evaluation, the \u201cBLUF,\u201d or \u201cbottom line up front,\u201d the DOD \nevaluator found that Applicant \u201cdisplays characteristics that could impair his judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. He has been diagnosed with ADHD, combined type, and is \nnot currently taking the medication recommended to him by his treating provider.\u201d (GE 2 \nat 1) The evaluator also noted Applicant\u2019s prior aggressive behavior, and evasion of \nresponsibility, in both criminal and financial contexts. The evaluator found that Applicant \ndid not display the insight and commitment to treatment that are prerequisites for real \nchange, resulting in a poor prognosis. (GE 2 at 1) \n \nIn 2011, the year he graduated high school, Applicant was charged with \nmisdemeanor reckless driving and felony eluding a police officer, after he \u201cspun tires\u201d in \na parking lot and drove away from an approaching police car. He may also have been \nstreet racing. (GE 1 at 24-25; GE 2 at 3; Tr. 30-31) The police report regarding this charge \nis not in the record, and this conduct is not alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \nIn 2014, Applicant was involved in an altercation between his mother and her then-\nhusband, his stepfather. Applicant reported that his stepfather \u201ctried to kill her.\u201d In \nresponse, Applicant pulled out a handgun and fired a warning shot into the ground in an \neffort to protect his mother from physical harm. Applicant was charged with brandishing \na firearm. The charge was dismissed after he attended anger management counseling \nand a gun safety class. (Tr. 29-30; GE 2 at 3) The police report regarding this charge is \nnot in the record, and this conduct is not alleged in the SOR.  \n \nThe 2018 DOD evaluation notes that, in about October 2014, Applicant was \ndiagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combined type, and \nadjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) The diagnosing \nprovider, Mr. G, is described as an \u201cLPC\u201d (licensed professional counselor). (GE 2 at 4) \nElsewhere in the evaluation, it is noted that the diagnosis was made by Mr. B, a \nphysician\u2019s assistant. (GE 2 at 3) \n \nApplicant acknowledged at hearing that he sought treatment from his physician in \nOctober 2014, after he found himself losing focus at work. He was diagnosed with ADHD \nand prescribed medication. (Tr. 52) He said he stopped taking his medication after a few \nmonths because he was having financial trouble and could not afford it. (Tr. 37-40, 52-\n54; GE 2 at 2)  \n \nEarlier, Applicant sought treatment from his primary care physician for anxiety in \n2012, after he was terminated from a job. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Tr. 32-33; GE 2 at 1, 2) The anxiety \ndiagnosis itself is not specifically referenced in the DOD CAF evaluation, or otherwise \ndocumented. Applicant attended one therapy session and was prescribed medication. He \nstopped taking the medication on his own after about two weeks because it was affecting \nhis sleep. (Tr. 28-29, 33-35, 56)  \n \nThe fact that Applicant discontinued treatment and stopped taking his medication \nin the past on these two occasions is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant\u2019s courses of \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntreatment and medication regimen on both occasions are undocumented, except as \nreferenced in the DOD evaluation.  \n \nOn his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had once been \u201cadmitted as inpatient\u201d for \nmental health treatment. (GE 1) He clarified at hearing that this was a misunderstanding, \nand that all of his treatment and counseling had been \u201coutpatient.\u201d (Tr. 63-65) \n \nThe DOD evaluator noted that Applicant \u201cappears to have a valid diagnosis of \nADHD, based on a pattern of impulsivity and neglect of responsibilities, as documented \nin his record.\u201d (Emphasis added). Applicant denied experiencing ADHD symptoms in his \ninterview, so the evaluator found that \u201can independent diagnosis cannot be definitively \nmade.\u201d The evaluator\u2019s conclusion was based largely on a review of Applicant\u2019s records, \nsince Applicant denied any current issues during his evaluation and was skeptical that \nthe prior recommendations for treatment he had received were necessary or appropriate. \nThe evaluator found that the information in the interview was not sufficient to overcome \nthe diagnoses of his past providers. (GE 2 at 3, 4)  \n \nThe evaluator concluded that Applicant \u201ccould address his ADHD with treatment \ncompliance and could potentially decrease his aggression and irresponsibility with \nappropriate treatment. But first, he needs \u201cinsight that his impulsivity, aggression, and \nirresponsibility are problematic and [needs to] comply with treatment consistently, for a \nnumber of years.\u201d The evaluator concluded that were Applicant to demonstrate two or \nmore years of treatment compliance, that might lead to a good prognosis by a treatment \nprovider or independent evaluator. However, Applicant has yet to demonstrate the \nnecessary level of insight or treatment compliance. (GE 3 at 5) Nevertheless, the \nevaluator did not specifically diagnose Applicant with ADHD.  \n \nThe evaluator diagnosed Applicant with attention deficit disorder (ADD), combined \ntype, by history, with a poor prognosis. (GE 2 at 5)  (SOR \u00b6 1.d) The evaluator did not \nnote a diagnostic code from the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n(DSM-V) to clarify whether the ADD diagnosis was mild, moderate, or severe. (See DSM-\nV at 60-61)  \n \nAs noted in the summary, the evaluator found that Applicant had other \npsychological characteristics that interfere with his judgment, trustworthiness, and \nreliability, including his \u201chistory of impulsive aggression, poor judgment in evading police, \nand evasion of financial responsibilities.\u201d (GE 3 at 5) But the evaluator did not conclude \nthat Applicant\u2019s ADD was sufficient to impact his judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.  \n \nApplicant testified that he loves his job at the shipyard. Without a clearance, he is \nsignificantly restricted on what he can do and where he can go at work. He wants to \nadvance professionally and is willing to do what is necessary to do that. (Tr. 48-49) \n \nIn January 2019, after receiving the SOR, Applicant sought out his primary care \nphysician. (Tr. 44-48) The progress notes from their March 2019 treatment session (post-\n\n \n5 \n \n \nhearing) reflect that Applicant had presented with a past history of ADD and was \nrequesting assistance with his appeal for a government security clearance. He was \nprescribed ADD medications as a child. Some medications were more effective than \nothers. Applicant expressed a willingness to see a clinical psychologist for counseling and \nwould like to try medication. (AE A at 6) Applicant\u2019s primary care doctor diagnosed him \nwith adult ADD, referred him to counseling, and prescribed Wellbutrin. (AE A at 1, 8) \n \nApplicant later reported that he had been unable to locate a psychiatrist with new \npatient openings or with office hours outside of his work schedule. He meets with an \ninformal counselor at his church once or twice a week. (AE B, AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988)) \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set forth in AG \u00b6 27:    \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of defense contractor who works at a \nshipyard. He needs a clearance for his job. He has a history of ADD and ADHD. At most, \nthe SOR alleges that he has a recent diagnosis of ADD, combined type, by history. The \nDOD evaluation on which the SOR is based does not establish that Applicant has even \n\u201cmild\u201d ADD, let alone \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d ADD, on a current, ongoing basis.  \n \n \nThe evaluator found that Applicant displays characteristics that impair his \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. However, the evaluator did not conclude that \nApplicant currently has ADHD, only that he had such a diagnosis in the past, as well as \na prior history of failing to comply with treatment and medication. \n \n \nAs the evaluation notes, and as Applicant admits, he has a history of troubling \nbehavior. He has a charge of reckless driving, and a charge of felony evading the police. \nThat incident occurred in about 2011 (the year he graduated high school), or perhaps \n2012, a year later. He reported the charges on his SCA, in 2013. The charges are \notherwise undocumented.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nA year later, in 2014, he was involved in a domestic disturbance with his stepfather, \nwho was arguing with his mother. He pulled out a firearm and fired a warning shot into \nthe ground in an attempt to protect her. He was charged with brandishing a firearm, but \nthe charge was dismissed after he attended counseling and a gun safety class. The \ncharges are otherwise undocumented.  \n \n \nImportantly, these charges are not alleged in the SOR as security significant \nconduct, under Guideline J (criminal conduct) or Guideline E (personal conduct). Nor are \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cdelinquent debts,\u201d as referenced in the evaluation, alleged in the SOR. Thus, \nI cannot, and do not, consider any of that evidence as disqualifying conduct. Further, that \nconduct, while admitted, is now also between five and eight years old, and there is no \nindication that it has been repeated recently.  \n \n \nWhat is left in this case, then, is an applicant with a recent diagnosis of ADD, \ncombined type, by history (in the DOD evaluation) confirmed by his primary care doctor. \nIn weighing the security significance of that condition. I note that I am not aware of any \nDOHA cases involving applicants whose history of ADD constitutes an ongoing security \nconcern on that basis alone. I have seen several other DOHA cases involving applicants \nwith ADD. But in those cases, the security concern has never been the condition itself \n(under Guideline I, as here), but rather an applicant\u2019s history of self-medication through \nmisuse of prescription drugs (conduct that is a security concern under AG \u00b6 24 Guideline \nH, for drug involvement), or other concerns. But here we have only the diagnosis.  \n \nIn this case, the Government has brought an SOR under the theory that attention \ndeficit disorder, combined type, by history, is a psychological condition that impacts an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to such a significant degree that the \nindividual is an ongoing security risk. I decline to adopt that view. AG \u00b6 28(b) does not \napply to that condition. Nor does it apply to Applicant\u2019s earlier conditions (anxiety and \nADHD), neither of which were confirmed by the evaluator. The fact that Applicant displays \n\u201ccharacteristics that could impair his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness\u201d is not \nsufficient. \n \n The Government also alleges, and Applicant admits, a past history of non-\ncompliance with treatment recommendations and medication regimens. But this, too, was \nfive years ago, concerning a diagnosis of ADHD that has not been confirmed as a current, \nongoing security concern. Without a psychological condition that is shown to be a security \nconcern, Applicant\u2019s failure to follow appropriate medical recommendations to treat that \npsychological condition cannot be a security concern, either. AG \u00b6 28(d) is not \nestablished.  \n \nSince I have concluded that no disqualifying conditions apply, I need not address \nthe application of the available mitigating conditions. I note, however, that Applicant has \naddressed his condition frankly with his primary care physician, is open to taking \nmedication for it as deemed medically appropriate, and is pursuing counseling, albeit \ninformally.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-\nperson analysis. \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor at a naval shipyard. \nHe has worked there since 2013. He has a history of poor judgment and impulsive \nbehavior, but that conduct is neither alleged in the SOR, nor is it particularly current. While \nApplicant has been found to have characteristics that could impair his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability, it is not established that he has a psychological condition \nthat impacts his suitability for a security clearance. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                  \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

De Angelis, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 25, 2016, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On May 30, 2018, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued her a set \nof interrogatories. Applicant responded to those interrogatories on June 20, 2018. On \nAugust 27, 2018, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an \n04/12/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract \nwith the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 11, 2018. In a sworn statement, dated \nOctober 30, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have her case decided \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) on January 25, 2019, and she was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the \nFORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM on February 6, 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s response was due within 30 days of the receipt of the FORM. Applicant \napparently chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of March 26, 2019, she had not \ndone so. The case was assigned to me on March 26, 2019.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the factual allegations in \nthe SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.d., 1.f., and 1.g.). She denied with comments and attachments \nthe remaining allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions, comments, and the information in the \nattachments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a medical service coordinator with her current employer since February 2017. A 1988 \nhigh school graduate, she received an associate\u2019s degree in 2006. Applicant has never \nserved with the U.S. military. She has never held a security clearance, and it is unclear if \nshe ever held a position of public trust. Applicant was married in 1992. She has two \nchildren, born in 1993 and 1996. \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties first arose, although those \nproblems and the unidentified circumstances that led to them were sufficient to motivate \nher to voluntarily jointly file, with her husband, for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. \nBankruptcy Code in November 1996. Deemed by the bankruptcy trustee as having no \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: Item 4 (e-QIP, dated October 25, 2016); Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nNovember 21, 2017); Item 5 (Subject Contact, dated March 26, 2018); Item 6 (Response to Interrogatories, \ndated June 20, 2018); Item 9 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated January \n7, 2017); Item 10 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 20, 2018; Item 11 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nDecember 31, 2018); Item 7 (Bankruptcy Petition, filed November 14, 1996); and Item 8 (Bankruptcy \nPetition, filed May 3, 2007).  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nassets, Applicant\u2019s unspecified debts were discharged in March 1997.2 Although her \nfinancial slate was clean and she was given a fresh start following the 1997 bankruptcy \ndischarge, unemployment from February 2007 until April 2007, as well as various \nunspecified circumstances and issues again arose within a decade, and in May 2007, she \nagain voluntarily jointly filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.3 This time, she managed to \naccrue $113,897 in debts to creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims, essentially \nconsumer charge accounts, credit cards, medical bills, student loans, and vehicle-related \nexpenses.4 Recognizing that debts for most student loans (Applicant listed $23,920 in \nsuch loans) are not discharged, the bankruptcy judge discharged Applicant\u2019s other debts \non August 22, 2007.5  \n \nOnce again, the financial slate was clean and she was given another fresh start, \nand once again, the cycle of financial difficulties reappeared, only this time, they did so \nwithin four years, starting in 2011. She had been unemployed from September 2007 until \nJanuary 2008. In 2011, faced with foreclosure on her residence, she submitted a deed in \nlieu of foreclosure; she drank heavily, consuming up to seven or eight drinks at a time \n(when three or four led to intoxication), and she became intoxicated every weekend; and \nshe became depressed. While she timely filed her federal personal income tax return for \nthe tax year 2011, she failed to make her final payment of the accrued tax, interest, and \npenalty, until November 2014.6 During the next few years, additional issues arose \ninvolving unspecified mental health treatment and additional periods of unemployment, \nand she failed to pay her personal state income taxes for the year 2016, although she \ntold an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in November \n2017 that she would start paying the estimated $790 owed starting the following month,7 \nsomething she failed to do as of March 2018.8 Instead, on an unspecified date, Applicant \n                                                          \n2 Item 7, supra note 1. \n \n3 Item 8, supra note 1. \n \n4 Item 8 (Schedule F \u2013 Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims). \n \n5 Item 8 (Discharge of Debtor, dated August 22, 2007). \n \n6 Item 6 (Account Transcript - 2011, dated June 15, 2018). \n \n7 Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5. \n \n8 Item 5 (Subject Contact), supra note 1, at 9. Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain \npurposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: \n(a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or \nchanged circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide \nevidence for whole-person analysis under Directive \u00a7 6.3.).

Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged delinquent accounts and other issues will be considered only for \nthe five purposes listed above. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nand the state department of revenue entered into a repayment plan calling for monthly \nautomatic $25 withdrawals.9 \n  \nIn addition to her two Chapter 7 bankruptcies, the SOR alleged five purportedly \ncontinuing delinquent debts totaling $50,063 that had been placed for collection, as \nfollows:  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.) is a student loan with a total unpaid balance of $20,547 (which \nsubsequently increased to $22,306, as reflected in her December 2018 credit report), of \nwhich $767 (which subsequently increased to $2,414, as reflected in her December 2018 \ncredit report) was past due, for which Applicant has failed to report any efforts to resolve.10 \nIn her October 2016 e-QIP, Applicant said that she planned to contact the creditor and \nmake arrangements to get the debt resolved, and since she had just obtained a new \nhigher-paying job, her efforts would commence \u201cvery soon.\u201d11 In her June 2018 response \nto the interrogatories, she indicated an intent to contact the creditor \u201cto get caught up.\u201d12 \nHowever, in her October 2018 Answer to the SOR, she admitted that the account remains \ndelinquent, and she failed to mention any efforts to contact the creditor to resolve the \naccount. According to her December 2018 credit report, Applicant made an unspecified \npayment to the creditor in December 2017, but as of 12 months later, she was at least \n120 days or more than four payments past due.13 The account has not been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c.) are two medical accounts with unpaid balances of $572 \nand $315, which are under a combined repayment plan authorizing 18 monthly $50 debits \nfrom her checking account, commencing in June 2018.14 Applicant contended in her \nAnswer to the SOR that the two of the medical accounts were on repayment plans and \nwere being paid, but she failed to submit meaningful documentation, such as copies of \nreceipts or her bank account statements, to support her contentions that any payments \nhad been made. In the absence of such documentation, it is unclear if the accounts are \nin the process of being resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.) is unpaid federal personal income tax for the tax year 2016 in the \namount of $4,164.10, as of July 2, 2018. Applicant was previously credited by the IRS \nwith making $100 payments on April 15, 2017, and again on September 13, 2017.

ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n13 Item 11, supra note 1, at 2. \n \n14 Item 10, supra note 1, at 2; Letter, undated, attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nfurther evidence was presented showing any other efforts by Applicant to resolve the \ndelinquency, and there is no pending installment agreement.15 In the absence of such \nevidence, that account has not been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e.) is unpaid small business taxes in the amount of $24,465 for the tax \nyears 2015 and 2016 owed by the limited liability company (LLC)16 that Applicant\u2019s father \nowned and for which he was the registered agent and responsible party.17 Applicant \nworked full-time as general manager or office manager of the LLC from January 2008 \nuntil November 2015.18 In January 2017, the IRS informed Applicant that she was \nresponsible for the LLC\u2019s taxes, and it combined the taxes owed by the LLC to Applicant\u2019s \nunpaid income taxes for the tax year 2011.  \n \nOn January 2, 2018, a financial services organization specializing in tax relief \nissues, representing Applicant, wrote a letter to the IRS requesting abatement of penalties \nassociated with the LLC\u2019s taxes.19 In the letter, Applicant was described as not the \nindividual responsible for financial decisions for the business, but was merely the day-to-\nday office manager. She had no decision-making responsibilities with regard to payroll, \naccounting, or bookkeeping. She was directed to pay only those bills that she was \ninstructed to pay by her father. Faced with insufficient funds to keep the operation afloat, \nApplicant requested that her father close it and sell the assets to pay for operating debt. \nExacerbating the situation were the deteriorating family dynamics following the demise of \nApplicant\u2019s mother and the severe depression of her father. Applicant attempted to \nwithdraw from the LLC in early 2015, but her father threatened suicide if she left. She \nrefused to sign quarterly tax reports, and she was unaware of any issues involving the \nIRS as her father was the sole individual associated with the LLC who was authorized to \ndo so.20 The IRS responded on several occasions in 2018, indicating that it was working \non the account, requesting additional information, and indicating on June 8, 2018, that \nthe matter had been forwarded to the Special Procedures function of Applicant\u2019s area IRS \noffice.21 \n                                                          \n15 Item 6 (Account Transcript - 2016, dated June 15, 2018). \n \n16 One of the most significant benefits of an LLC is that of pass-through taxes. The IRS treats one-\nmember LLCs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes. This means that the LLC itself does not pay taxes \nand does not have to file a return with the IRS. LLC \u201cowners\u201d don't have to file a corporate tax return, but \nsimply reports their share of profit and loss on their individual tax return.  \n \n17 The \u201cresponsible party\u201d is the person who ultimately owns or controls the entity or who exercises \nultimate effective control over the entity. The person identified as the responsible party should have a level \nof control over, or entitlement to, the funds or assets in the entity that, as a practical matter, enables the \nperson, directly or indirectly, to control, manage, or direct the entity and the disposition of its funds and \nassets. See IRS Instructions for Form SS-4, Rev. December 2017. \n \n18 Item 4, supra note 1, at 15; Item 5 (Subject Contact), supra note 1, at 9.  \n  \n19 Letter, dated January 2, 2018, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the interrogatories, and to \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR. \n \n20 Letter, supra note 19. \n \n21 Letter, dated June 8, 2018, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the interrogatories. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nApplicant signed a 2013 Biennial Report for a state LLC in August 22, 2014, as the \noffice manager, and as such she was a person authorized by the company to sign the \nreport. However, the report in question clearly listed Applicant\u2019s father as the registered \nagent for the LLC. Applicant\u2019s name on the report is only her signature as a person \nauthorized by the company to sign the report, not as the responsible party.22 While the \ninformation reflected in the IRS-directed documentation regarding Applicant\u2019s status with \nthe LLC constitutes a scintilla of evidence guessing that Applicant was a \u201cresponsible \nparty\u201d of the LLC, never actually identifying her as such, that level of evidence failed to \nconstitute substantial evidence of that fact. Accordingly, while Department Counsel noted \nthat DOHA is not the appropriate entity to determine Applicant\u2019s status with respect to the \nLLC tax liability, such a position does not prevent me from weighing the evidence to \ndetermine if there is substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s liability and responsibility for the \nLLC taxes. Further confusing the situation is that according to the Secretary of State\u2019s \nrecords, this particular LLC, identifying Applicant\u2019s father as the registered agent of the \nLLC, became inactive on April 10, 2012.23 \nApplicant\u2019s joint family adjusted gross income was $80,567 for the tax year 2011; \n$64,453 for the tax year 2012; $72,028 for the tax year 2013; $75,761 for the tax year \n2014; $69,602 for the tax year 2015; and $53,774 for the tax year 2016.24 \nOther than a certificate of credit counseling in May 2007 associated with \nApplicant\u2019s 2007 bankruptcy, and an inferred identical type of counseling associated with \nher 1996 bankruptcy, there is no evidence that Applicant has received more recent \nfinancial counseling. There is no evidence of a budget. Applicant did not explain what \ncorrective actions she has taken over an extensive period to avoid the pitfalls or other \nfactors that she identified as the ones that caused her financial difficulties. She offered \nonly generalized explanations for her failure to make more timely attempts to resolve her \naccounts. Furthermore, there is no Personal Financial Statement to reflect her current net \nmonthly income, monthly expenses, or any remainder available for discretionary use or \nsavings. There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant\u2019s financial situation is now under \ncontrol.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d25 As Commander in Chief, the President \nhas the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \n                                                          \n22 Item 12 (2013 Biennial Report, dated August 22, 2014). \n \n23 Administrative Judge Exhibit I (Business Entity Summary, dated April 11, 2019). \n \n24 Account Transcripts, various dates, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the interrogatories. \n \n25 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \ninformation. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained \nin the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.26  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d27 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.28  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \n                                                          \n26 It should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nCounterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, \ncovers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for \ntrustworthiness determinations. \n \n27 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n28 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.29 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b619:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has had a long-standing problem with her finances, stretching back over \ntwo decades. As a result, various accounts became delinquent. She had two Chapter 7 \nbankruptcies and now has more delinquent accounts. Her student loans are delinquent \nand she owes the IRS over $4,000. She may also owe the IRS over $24,465 on behalf of \nthe LLC. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been \nestablished.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n                                                          \n29 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;30 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;31  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) minimally apply, but neither of the remaining \nmitigating conditions apply.

Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n31 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nfinancial difficulties make it difficult to conclude that it \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it is \n\u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial problems started in 10-year cycles, with Chapter \n7 bankruptcy discharges in 1997 and 2007, and the cycle started again within four years. \nWhile Applicant generally attributed her financial difficulties to a variety of factors, \nincluding heavy drinking, depression, mental health treatment, periods of unemployment, \nand to a degree, her relationship with her father, in truth, in the absence of more complete \nexplanations and some documentation to support her contentions, few of those factors \nwere due to conditions that were largely beyond her control. Applicant\u2019s financial slate \nwas clean and she was given a fresh start following both bankruptcies, but her account \nbalances continued to rise until they became unmanageable, and then delinquent. A \nresidence was almost foreclosed, but was saved by a deed in lieu of foreclosure; a student \nloan was largely ignored; state and federal personal income taxes went unpaid, and she \ndoes not have a pending installment agreement with respect to her delinquent 2016 \nfederal personal income taxes.  \n \nWhile Applicant submitted a repayment agreement pertaining to her delinquent \nmedical accounts, as noted above, she failed to submit meaningful documentation such \nas copies of receipts or her bank account statements, to support her contentions that any \npayments had been made. In the absence of such documentation, the accounts may be \nin the process of being resolved, or they may not be. \n \nIt is difficult to conclude that Applicant made substantial timely good-faith efforts to \nresolve her delinquent accounts, despite periods of having reasonably modest income \nduring the years 2011 through 2016. Applicant was initially interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator in November 2017, and although she made promises to contact her creditors \nto start resolving her delinquent debts, she essentially failed to follow through. An \napplicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being placed on \nnotice that his or her eligibility for a public trust position is in jeopardy may be lacking in \nthe judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is \nno immediate threat to his or her own interests.32 A person who still has not addressed \nthose debts raises even more doubts. \nThere is no evidence of a budget. There is limited and stale evidence of financial \ncounseling. However, there is substantial evidence of a dispute related to the federal tax \nliability of the LLC that the IRS has attributed to Applicant. As of June 8, 2018, the IRS\u2019s \nspecial procedures office was still looking into the matter. Applicant offered no evidence \nto indicate that her financial situation is now under better control. In this instance, to date, \nthere is minimal meaningful evidence that corrective actions have been taken by \nApplicant. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.33 \n                                                          \n32 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n33 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, especially after a multi-year delay in taking any action, without further confirmed \naction, are insufficient. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.34  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 49-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor, serving as a medical service coordinator since \nFebruary 2017. A high school graduate, she received an associate\u2019s degree in 2006. She \nexperienced several relatively brief periods of unemployment. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant has had a long-standing problem with her finances, stretching back over two \ndecades. Her delinquent debts were discharged by two Chapter 7 bankruptcies a decade \napart, and her financial slate was clean and she was given a fresh start, but now she has \nmore delinquent accounts. Her student loans are delinquent and she owes the IRS over \n                                                          \n34 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n$4,000 for the tax year 2016. It is also possible that she may also owe the IRS over \n$24,465 on behalf of the LLC. Applicant essentially ignored her debts over the years, \ndespite making repeated statements in her e-QIP, to the OPM investigator, in her \nresponse to the interrogatories, and in her Answer to the SOR, that she would start making \npayments. She contended that there was a repayment plan for two medical accounts, and \nwhile she submitted the plan, she failed to submit documentation to reflect any payments \nwere actually made. When she had the opportunity to present more current evidence of \nany good-faith efforts to resolve the other delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR, she \nfailed to do so, even after the FORM was sent to her. Considering all of the above, I am \nunable to reach a positive conclusion pertaining to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \npublic trust. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:35 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, seemingly continuing to avoid her debts. Overall, the evidence leaves \nme with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nposition of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. \nA, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \n \n                                                          \n35 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nJanuary 28, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 20, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-\nQIP). (Government Exhibit 1.)  On August 22, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse.  The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 4, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 29, 2018.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November \n15, 2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 4, 2018.  The \nGovernment offered two exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which \n\n \n2 \n \nwere admitted without objection. The Applicant offered no exhibits at the hearing.  The \nrecord remained open until close of business on December 11, 2018, to allow Applicant \nthe opportunity to submit supporting documentation.  Applicant submitted three Post-\nHearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 3, which \nwere admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 13, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old.  He is not married and has no children.  He has a \nBachelor\u2019s of Science degree in Electrical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense \ncontractor as an Electrical Engineer.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \n \nApplicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes his use of marijuana from \nabout July 2006 to at least June 2017; cocaine use from about July 2010 to July 2017; \nand ecstasy use from about July 2010 to July 2012.  He has also purchased marijuana \nin June 2017. \n \n \nApplicant attended college from 2009 to 2016, when he graduated.  During \ncollege he states that he used marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy at varying frequencies \nfor recreational purposes.  As a rough estimate, he believes he used marijuana in high \nschool from eight to ten times and in college probably five to eight times. After college, \nhe used marijuana three times while working for a defense contractor. (Tr. p. 29.)  In \nregard to cocaine, he believes he used it five to ten times in high school and the same \nfrequency in college.  He used ecstasy two or three times at events in high school and \nabout the same frequency in college.  (Tr. p. 31.)  Applicant also purchased marijuana \non two occasions, once in college, and once in June 2017.  He states that he also \npurchased cocaine in 2011.   \n \n \nAfter graduating from college, Applicant went straight to his position with his \ncurrent employer which started in August 2016.  Applicant knew at that time that he \nwould be required to apply for a security clearance at some point as it was mandatory \nfor all employees.  He also knew that his company had a zero tolerance policy regarding \nthe use of illegal drugs.  (Tr. pp. 20 - 21.)  After being hired by the company, and after \nworking there over a year, Applicant used marijuana in June 2017 on three occasions \nwith the same person.  He also used cocaine with his cousin in July 2017.  (Tr. p. 28.)  \nApplicant states that he last used ecstasy in July 2012, and has not used ecstasy since \ncollege.   \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a letter of intent dated December 7, 2018, to declare his \nabstinence from the use, purchase, possession, manufacturing and distribution of any \nillegal substance.  The letter further states that any future misuse of any illegal drug will \nbe grounds for immediate revocation of his national security eligibility.  (Applicant\u2019s \nPost-Hearing Exhibit C.)      \n \n \nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor dated December 5, 2018, indicates that \nhe hired the Applicant and that since then Applicant has been an excellent electrical \nengineer.  He is described as talented and hard-working and can always be counted on \nto get to the work done.  He is said to be professional and respectful of his colleagues.  \nHis supervisor recommends him for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing \nExhibit A.)   \n \n \nA performance review of the Applicant for the period from April 1, 2016, through \nMarch 31, 2017, reflects that he \u201cmeets all job requirements.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing \nExhibit B.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia, and  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation.  Applicant is a young \nand immature man, with little experience in the defense industry.  Although he is a 27 \nyear-old man, he is a fairly recent college graduate, who used a number of illegal drugs \nwhile in college and continued to use them after he graduated, and after being hired to \nwork in the defense industry.  His last use of marijuana and cocaine are considered \nrecent.  Applicant was aware of his company\u2019s zero tolerance drug policy as well as \nDoD policy, but chose to defy the policies by using marijuana and cocaine after being \nhired by and working for a defense contractor.  There is no excuse for this misconduct.        \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n6 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant is well respected on the job and is \nconsidered to be an excellent engineer.  However, he has failed to provide sufficient \nevidence to demonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concern. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/28/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant suffers from a mental health condition that could impair his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. He intends to continue to use medical marijuana knowing \nthat such drug use is illegal under federal law. Psychological conditions, drug involvement \nand substance misuse, and personal conduct security concerns are not adequately \nmitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn September 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline I (psychological conditions), Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse), and Guideline E (personal conduct). The SOR \nexplained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \n \n\nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 27, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn March 12, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed to a hearing. On March 18, \n2019, I scheduled a hearing for April 9, 2019, to determine whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were admitted in evidence. \nApplicant and his spouse testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on April 19, \n2019. \n \nI held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for post-hearing submissions \nfrom Applicant. No documents were received by the deadline, and the record closed on \nApril 23, 2019. \n \n2 \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that under one or more of the AGs I (SOR \u00b6 1), H (SOR \u00b6 2), and \nE (SOR \u00b6 3) the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant attempted suicide in about 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant experienced a year-long episode of depression with some inability \nto function in 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was diagnosed with depression in 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was diagnosed with moderate depressive disorder and general \nanxiety disorder with a poor prognosis in December 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, recurrent; general \nanxiety disorder; and unspecified cannabis-related disorder in February 2016 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 2.d); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant had suicidal thoughts because of financial difficulties in 2018 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.f); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe; \ngeneralized anxiety disorder; and cannabis use disorder, mild in March 2018 \nwith a guarded prognosis (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 2.d); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant continues to experience symptoms of depression, including \nrecurrent suicidal ideation, despite his treatment (SOR  \u00b6 1.h); \n\n \n\uf0b7 Applicant has used marijuana twice weekly since about 2015 and intends to \ncontinue to use marijuana in the future (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant has purchased marijuana illegally since about 2015 and intends to \npurchase marijuana illegally (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 3.a); and \n \n\uf0b7 During a March 2018 evaluation, Applicant expressed uncertainty regarding \nhis willingness to discontinue marijuana use (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 3.a). \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the allegations, but with some \nexplanations. He indicated that his depression in 2014 was exacerbated by his physical \ncondition that caused him chronic pain and compromised his ability to function with \nregularity. He acknowledged that he had thoughts of suicide in 2014, but asserted that a \ndistinction should be drawn between suicidal thoughts, which he has on a regular basis as \na symptom of his depression, and suicidal urges, which do not regularly occur and he was \nnot currently experiencing. Applicant contested the diagnosis of a cannabis-related \ndisorder and explained that his use of cannabis was always medicinal. He added that he \ncurrently holds a state-issued medical marijuana card. Applicant admitted that he had \npurchased marijuana illegally in the past, but asserted that all of his purchases are now \nfrom a medical dispensary with his medical marijuana card. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old senior software engineer, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since January 1, 2015.1 He previously worked as a subcontractor for the \ncompany. Applicant began cohabiting with his spouse in approximately October 2013. \nThey married in October 2017. In May 2011, Applicant was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in \ncomputational mathematics and an \u201cAll but Thesis\u201d master\u2019s degree in applied \nmathematics. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 20-21.) \n \nApplicant began suffering from depression as a teenager. He attempted suicide in \n2006. (Tr. 22-23.) At age 18, he had suicidal thoughts that led to some psychotherapy and \nmedication management. He found the psychotherapy unhelpful and did not continue after \nsome initial contacts. (GE 2.) \n \n1 Applicant testified that he worked as a subcontractor for his employer \u201cright out of college in 2011 or 2012.\u201d \n(Tr. 20.) He provided dates for that employment on his SF 86 of February 2012 to December 2013, and \nindicated that he started at another company (company X) in January 2014. At his hearing, he testified that he \nworked for company X for about a year before becoming a direct hire of his current employer on January 1, \n2014. The dates on his SF 86 would indicate a start date instead of January 2015 for his current employment. \nThe SF 86 of record was signed on January 6, 2015. (GE 1.)  \n3 \n \n                                                 \n\n4 \n \nWhile in college from August 2007 to August 2011, Applicant experienced \ndepression that went untreated. In 2010, he attempted suicide while stressed because of \nschool demands. He did not pursue mental health treatment at that time. It was a wake-up \ncall for him. He left college in August 2011 before finishing his thesis, and he voluntarily \nsought psychiatric treatment from December 2011 to March 2012. He took medication for \nhis depression for about six months with some improvement in his condition. Apparently in \nconsultation with his then treating psychiatrist, Applicant stopped taking the medication with \nno apparent adverse impacts on his mental health for the next two years. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 22-\n23.) \n \nApplicant worked as an online sales manager for a computer hardware reseller and \nthen as an associate software developer, where he was placed as a subcontractor with his \ncurrent employer starting in February 2012. (GE 2.) In approximately 2014, Applicant was \ndiagnosed with a medical condition that can cause chronic pain. In May 2014, he \npurchased his current residence. Stressed financially, often in a great deal of pain, and \nvery depressed, Applicant had impaired functionality and was unable to work for \napproximately one year. (Tr. 24.) He was not yet on appropriate medications. (Tr. 19, 25.) \nHe attempted suicide one time in 2014, but he has not had any suicide attempts since \nthen. (Tr. 29.) Applicant attributes his poor mental health at that time to his physical illness. \n(Tr. 25.) His spouse held the household together while he spent much of the year in bed. \nShe had a small business. She paid the bills, purchased the groceries, and took care of \nhim. (GE 2.) \n  \nIn mid-May 2014, Applicant began treatment from his primary care physician for \ndiagnosed depression and for some medical conditions, including a longstanding seizure \ndisorder, well controlled with medication. Applicant was placed on Zoloft to be reevaluated \nin one month. He experienced moderate improvement in his depression by mid-June 2014, \nand reported no substance abuse or suicidal ideation, but he continued to lack energy and \nenthusiasm. He complained of some fatigue over the summer, and recurrent seizures led \nto changes in his anti-depressant medication. By late August 2014, his depression had \nincreased to where he had some passive suicidal thoughts. Several medication changes \nled to some improvement in his mood, but he continued to experience fatigue and pain. As \nof late September 2014, his anxiety was interfering with his concentration, and he had \nmoderate depression but no substance abuse or suicidal ideation. By November 2014, he \nwas able to work from home. His depression was stable, and he had moderate control of \nhis medical condition that causes him chronic pain. (GE 3.) \n \nApplicant experienced increased anxiety in late 2014 and early 2015 related to his \nreturn to work. (Tr. 26.) From December 3, 2014, through March 24, 2015, Applicant had \nnine counseling sessions with a licensed psychologist for treatment of diagnosed moderate \ndepressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Applicant presented as moderately \nto severely depressed, chronic and recurrent, and he described overwhelming panic \nattacks that became debilitating and compromised his functionality. In the opinion of the \npsychologist, Applicant\u2019s symptoms were serious and interfered with his productivity at \nwork and home. His concentration and decision-making ability were impaired, and he was \n\n5 \n \nat ongoing risk of suicide. Throughout their sessions, Applicant\u2019s progress and prognosis \nwere assessed as poor. (GE 4.) \n \nOn December 22, 2014, Applicant completed and electronically certified to the \naccuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions that he signed on January 6, \n2015. He disclosed that he had mental health counseling from December 2011 to March \n2012 and was currently in treatment with his primary care physician and the licensed \npsychologist. (GE 1.) \n \n \nDuring an office visit with his primary care physician in mid-March 2015, Applicant \nreported less pain on his medication regimen. His fatigue issues were in moderate control, \nbut his depression was in poor control. He was placed on Cymbalta to address his \ndepression primarily with a hoped for positive effect on his chronic pain and fatigue. As of \nJune 2015, the Cymbalta was no longer effective in controlling Applicant\u2019s depression. He \ncomplained of more fatigue and worsening musculoskeletal pain with no relief from \nnarcotics. His primary care physician referred him to a psychiatrist. (GE 3.) Applicant began \nseeing a psychiatrist monthly, although he did not follow through on her recommendation \nthat he obtain psychotherapy because he did not have the time, money, or energy. (GE 2.) \n \n \nAt the recommendation of a friend, Applicant began smoking marijuana in 2015 to \ntreat his chronic pain. Over the next three years, he smoked a bowl of marijuana twice \nweekly. He found marijuana to be an effective pain medication, and he continued to use it, \nknowing that it was illegal. After six months of using the drug illegally, he informed his \nprimary care physician about his marijuana use. His physician provided him information \nabout how to obtain medical marijuana in the state. Applicant did not apply for a medical \nmarijuana card at that time because it was cost prohibitive for him. He continued to \npurchase marijuana illegally from an acquaintance. Applicant did not use any marijuana at \nwork. (GE 2; Tr. 17-18, 32-33.) \n \n \nIn early 2016, Applicant experienced debilitating pain from his medical condition. At \nthe suggestion of his psychiatrist, Applicant received treatment at a psychiatric hospital \nfrom February 24, 2016, through March 18, 2016, for diagnosed major depressive disorder, \nrecurrent; generalized anxiety disorder; and unspecified cannabis-related disorder. He was \ntreated initially in a partial hospitalization program and then at the intensive outpatient level \nof care. At discharge, he was referred to a psychiatric practice and prescribed medications, \nincluding Lithium for suicidal thoughts, Nortriptyline for his depression, and Buspar and \nXanax (as needed) for anxiety. Nortriptyline improved his depression and pain sufficiently \nso that he could return to work. (GE 2; Tr. 26-27.) \n \n \nApplicant began psychotherapy for \u201csevere depression and severe anxiety\u201d with a \nlicensed clinical social worker (LCSW) in December 2017 after his psychiatrist told him that \nhe had to participate in psychotherapy if he wanted to continue in treatment with her. For \nfinancial reasons, Applicant took a break from his psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW \nfrom January 2018 until late February 2018. (GE 2.) \n \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant was denied interim security-clearance eligibility in February 2018. It had \nno impact on his present duties. He discussed the declination of his interim clearance with \nhis current supervisors, and they want to retain him if he is denied security-clearance \neligibility, but it could have future impacts as to project assignments. (Tr. 21-22.) Applicant \ndid not indicate to what extent, if any, he discussed the issues that generated security \nconcern with his supervisors. \n \n \n  At the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant had a psychological evaluation by a \nlicensed psychologist on March 4, 2018. Applicant\u2019s diagnosis was complicated by his \nmedical problems and multiple medications, but his depression and anxiety appeared to be \nprominent issues. Applicant disclosed his illegal marijuana use for pain, and he expressed \na plan to continue his marijuana use. He expressed uncertainty about whether he would \nstop using marijuana, even if required for his security clearance. The psychologist \ndiagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe; generalized anxiety \ndisorder; and cannabis use disorder, mild, and concluded that Applicant has a condition \nthat could negatively impact his judgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness. In his \nclinical opinion, Applicant\u2019s condition is being partially treated, but Applicant\u2019s \u201cchronic \nsuicidal thoughts and recent ultimatum from his prescriber about starting psychotherapy \nare concerns.\u201d (GE 2.) He gave Applicant a guarded prognosis, despite finding it likely that \nApplicant would continue in treatment with his present providers. The psychologist opined \nthat should Applicant discontinue mental health treatment, his reliability, judgment, and \nstability would be negatively impacted. (GE 2.) Applicant had suicidal thoughts in 2018 \nbecause of financial issues, which have since been resolved with some financial help from \nfamily members. (Tr. 19, 28, 47.) \n \n \nIn May 2018, Applicant and his spouse obtained medical marijuana cards \nauthorizing them to use marijuana legally in their state.2 (Tr. 17-18, 40.) The drug alleviates \nApplicant\u2019s insomnia and acute anxiety attacks. (Tr. 31.) Since obtaining his medical \nmarijuana card, Applicant has used marijuana \u201cpretty much on a daily basis,\u201d although not \nbefore reporting to work or before driving a vehicle.  (Tr. 33, 41.) He used marijuana the \nnight before his security clearance hearing, knowing that marijuana is illegal under federal \nlaw. Before obtaining their medical marijuana cards, Applicant and his spouse discussed \nthe possible impact on his job. Applicant suspected, but did not know for certain, that \nmedical marijuana use is against DOD policy. Applicant admitted at his hearing that he is \n\u2018probably not\u201d willing to stop using marijuana to obtain a security clearance. Applicant has \ntried alternative therapies to marijuana, including dietary changes, legal medications, \ntobacco, exercise, and cannabidiol, but they have not been as effective as marijuana in \naddressing his pain or his anxiety. (Tr. 34-36, 45-46.) Since acquiring their medical \n                                                 \n2 On October 1, 2012, Applicant\u2019s state passed an act concerning the palliative use of marijuana, allowing a \nlicensed physician to certify an adult patient\u2019s use of marijuana after determining that the patient has a \ndebilitating medical condition as defined by the act or subsequently approved by the state\u2019s Department of \nConsumer Protection and that the potential benefits of the palliative use of marijuana would likely outweigh its \nhealth risk. Patients are required to have a written certification by a physician, which is valid for one year, and \nare required to obtain their marijuana from a state-licensed dispensary. A qualifying patient who has a valid \nregistration certificate from the state\u2019s Department of Consumer Protection is not authorized to possess an \namount of usable marijuana in quantity exceeding that reasonably necessary to ensure uninterrupted \navailability for one month.   \n\n7 \n \nmarijuana cards, Applicant and his spouse have obtained their marijuana solely from state-\nlicensed dispensaries. (Tr. 41.)  \n \n \nApplicant did not have any suicidal thoughts in the six months preceding his April \n2019 hearing, but suicidal thoughts have been a recurring issue for him his entire adult life. \n(Tr. 30.) He has been taking a new medication in the past few months that has been \nhelpful. (Tr. 28.) Applicant has been under the care of his current psychotherapist since \nJanuary 2019. (Tr. 31.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that she has seen a marked improvement in Applicant\u2019s \nmental health in the last year. (Tr. 38.) In her opinion, his depression has lessened as he \nhas been able to get his physical pain under control. (Tr. 39.) \n \n \nApplicant showed his spouse his latest work performance evaluation, which was \nvery positive. He obtained a raise and a promotion in January 2019 to senior software \nengineer. (Tr. 42-43.)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n\n8 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe security concerns about psychological conditions are articulated in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this \nguideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No negative \ninference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on \nthe basis of mental health counseling. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of moderate to severe depression and anxiety exacerbated \nby stress. He attempted suicide in 2006, 2010, and 2014, and suicidal thoughts have been \na recurring issue throughout his adult life. In his favor, Applicant recognized that he needed \npsychiatric treatment after college, and with professional help and medication, his condition \nremained stable until 2014. His mental health deteriorated so significantly in 2014 that he \nwas unable to work for about one year. Under the monitoring of his primary care physician \nand his psychiatrist, Applicant has taken several medications over the years with varying \nrelief to address his diagnosed depression and anxiety disorders. During his partial \nhospitalization program in 2016, Applicant was started on a tricyclic anti-depressant, which \nbrought about some improvement in his mental health. Yet, he continued to experience \ndepression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. He failed to follow through with his psychiatrist\u2019s \nrecommendation that he obtain psychotherapy until December 2017, after his psychiatrist \nconditioned her continued treatment of him on him obtaining psychotherapy. In March \n2018, a duly-qualified psychologist diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder, \nrecurrent, severe; generalized anxiety disorder; and cannabis use disorder, mild. The \nclinician concluded that Applicant has a condition that could negatively impact his \njudgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness, and he assessed Applicant\u2019s prognosis \n\n9 \n \nas guarded. Applicant\u2019s mental health has improved over the past year. Even so, he \ncontinued to have suicidal thoughts to as recently as autumn 2018. \n \n \nApplicant has had the same primary care provider for the past five years. He has \nhad a consistent therapeutic relationship with a psychiatrist since 2015. He resumed \npsychotherapy in December 2017, and after a break for insurance reasons, he returned to \npsychotherapy in late February 2018. Mental health counseling is regarded favorably, and \nno negative inferences are raised solely on the basis of counseling. However, security \nconcerns are raised under Guideline I when the conditions for which a person is in \ncounseling can impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness with regard to handling or \nsafeguarding classified information. Applicant\u2019s suicide attempts implicate disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 28(a), which provides: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behavior. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b), \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness,\u201d \nis established. Available clinical records from Applicant\u2019s primary care provider show that \nhe has been treated for diagnosed depression. At the suggestion of his psychiatrist, \nApplicant received treatment in a partial hospitalization program at a psychiatric hospital \nfrom February 24, 2016, through March 18, 2016, for diagnosed major depressive disorder, \nrecurrent; generalized anxiety disorder; and unspecified cannabis-related disorder. A DOD-\napproved licensed psychologist diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder, \nrecurrent, severe and with generalized anxiety disorder in March 2018. The psychologist \nindicated that Applicant\u2019s condition could cause impaired judgment, stability, and reliability, \nand that it would cause impairment if Applicant discontinued his treatment. The records of \nApplicant\u2019s partial hospitalization were not provided in evidence, so it is unclear how many \ndays Applicant spent as an inpatient that would trigger AG \u00b6 28(c), \u201cvoluntary or involuntary \nhospitalization.\u201d \n \n \nFor some time, Applicant did not comply with his psychiatrist\u2019s recommendation that \nhe participate in psychotherapy. He has acknowledged that he put off psychotherapy due \nto not having the time, money, or energy. He began psychotherapy in December 2017 only \nafter his psychiatrist gave him an ultimatum. AG \u00b6 28(d) also has some applicability, \nalthough there is no evidence that Applicant has failed to comply with his treatment plan in \nthe past year or so. AG \u00b6 28(d) states: \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n \n\n10 \n \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing one or more of the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Regarding AG \u00b6 29(a), Applicant\u2019s \nmajor depressive disorder and his anxiety disorder are conditions that are controllable with \ntreatment. However, his mental health condition is complicated because of his medical \nissues, including the illness that has caused him debilitating pain. His depression has been \nrecurrent, and his anxiety has been exacerbated by stress. Applicant and his spouse \ntestified credibly to a considerable improvement in his mental health over the past year, \nwhich they attribute to successful pain management with prescribed medications and \nmarijuana. There is no evidence of any suicide attempts by Applicant since 2014. However, \nApplicant continued to experience suicidal thoughts until autumn 2018. Applicant lacks the \nfavorable prognosis by a duly-qualified mental health professional that is required under \nAG \u00b6 29(b). There is no recent medical opinion in evidence that Applicant is not at risk of \nrelapse into such depression or anxiety that could cause impairment of his judgment or \nreliability. Given Applicant\u2019s guarded prognosis in March 2018, it cannot reasonably be \nconcluded that his situation has been resolved under AG \u00b6 29(d) or that there is no \nindication of a current problem under AG \u00b6 29(e). Applicant showed good judgment by \nparticipating in treatment, but his treatment has not prevented recurrence of symptoms. \nThe psychological conditions security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are articulated \nin AG \u00b6 24: \n \n\n11 \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \n \nApplicant used marijuana twice a week from 2015 until May 2018 to cope with \nchronic pain when prescribed narcotics proved ineffective. He illegally used and purchased \nmarijuana while employed by a defense contractor, knowing that it was against federal law. \nWhile in a partial hospitalization program primarily for his mental health issues in February \n2016, Applicant was diagnosed in part with unspecified cannabis-related disorder. In March \n2018, a DOD-approved psychologist diagnosed him in part with cannabis use disorder, \nmild. Applicant expressed uncertainty in March 2018 whether he would discontinue his \nmarijuana use even if his use negatively impacted his security clearance eligibility. When it \nwas no longer unaffordable for him, Applicant obtained a medical marijuana card in May \n2018. He has used marijuana daily since then, including the night before his hearing. He or \nhis spouse have purchased it from state-licensed dispensaries. His use and purchase \nsince May 2018 has been legal in his state, but not under federal law or DOD policy.3 \nDuring his April 2019 hearing, Applicant admitted that he would probably not stop using \nmedical marijuana. The following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 apply: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly-qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof substance use disorder; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n                                                 \n3 Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I drug. Despite some states providing for medical marijuana use or the \ndecriminalization or legalization of recreational use of minor amounts of the drug, marijuana remains a \nSchedule I controlled substance under federal law. Such drugs have a high potential for abuse, no currently \naccepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and lack accepted safety for using the drug under \nmedical supervision. \n  \n\n12 \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation of drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns, as follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility;  \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended: and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has used and purchased \nmarijuana regularly since 2015 in knowing violation of federal law. Until May 2018, his use \nand purchase was also illegal under state law. Applicant cannot commit to discontinue his \nmarijuana use, despite knowing that state laws permitting medical marijuana do not alter \nthe federal prohibition or existing national security guidelines concerning marijuana use.  \nApplicant\u2019s primary care physician and psychiatrist are aware of his use of marijuana, and \napparently are not concerned about his use to alleviate medical issues. However, Applicant \ncannot satisfy AG \u00b6 26(b) as long as he intends to continue to use marijuana. The drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \n  \nThe concerns about personal conduct are articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \n\n13 \n \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nRegarding the Government\u2019s case under Guideline E because of Applicant\u2019s illegal \ndrug involvement and his failure to convincingly commit to discontinue his marijuana use \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a), the Appeal Board has held that security-related conduct can be considered \nunder more than one guideline, and in an appropriate case, be given independent weight \nunder each. See ISCR Case No. 11-06672 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2012). Separate from the risk \nof physiological impairment associated with the use of a mood-altering substance, which is \na Guideline H concern, Applicant had an obligation as a defense-contractor employee to \ncomply with federal law and DOD policy prohibiting illegal drug use. Applicant exercised \n\u201cquestionable judgment\u201d within the general security concerns set forth in AG \u00b6 15. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana occurred after he applied for a DOD security clearance, \nand it is conduct that could trigger disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), which provides: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n \nIt is unclear if Applicant\u2019s employer is aware of his illegal marijuana use. Applicant \nreports that he discussed the potential loss of his security clearance with supervisory \npersonnel, although he did not provide any specifics about what they know about the \nsecurity concerns. However, Applicant has been candid with the DOD about his marijuana \nuse and future intentions. Potential issues of vulnerability are mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(e), \n\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d However, his candor about his marijuana use does not justify his \nongoing disregard of the federal prohibition against marijuana use, even if it is for medicinal \npurposes and is legally prescribed. The personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn the whole-person evaluation, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).4 \n                                                 \n4 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n14 \n \n \nApplicant is credited with recognizing the deterioration of his mental health and \nseeking treatment as needed. He has made considerable strides in managing his mental \nhealth. As evidenced by his recent positive work performance evaluation and promotion, \nApplicant is valued by his supervisors. Even so, I cannot ignore the opinion of a duly-\nqualified clinical psychologist that Applicant\u2019s mental health is only partially treated and that \nhis judgment and reliability will be impaired if he discontinues treatment. Applicant\u2019s \nprognosis was guarded as of March 2018. His present treatment regimen may be effective \nin managing his psychological conditions long term, but that remains to be seen. His \nmarijuana use may be condoned by his medical providers, but it is inconsistent with federal \nlaw and DOD policy. Given Applicant is not willing to commit to abstention, I am unable to \nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Findings of Fact1 Based upon Applicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR Response and a careful review of her testimony and that of her character witnesses, the documentary evidence admitted into the record, the extensive, additional information provided by Applicant in her SOR Response, and the parties\u2019 administrative notice requests, I make the following findings of fact. 1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her security clearance application, dated January 19, 2016, (GE 1), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 3 Applicant is a 60-year-old software engineer, who is now specialized as a web developer. She has worked and studied in the information technology and related fields for most of her adult life. From 1997 until January 2015, she lived and worked in Israel. In 1997, she obtained employment in Israel as a software engineer for a German company. She then worked as an analyst for an Israeli contractor of an international technology company. From June 2007 until January 2015, she worked as a technical writer for an Israeli-based technology company. In January 2015, she relocated from Israel to the United States and was unemployed for about a year. In January 2016, she began working for her security clearance sponsor. While unemployed and living in the United States, she sought employment, and for a period, she was a full-time student taking classes in computer coding. (GE 2 at 3-4; SOR Response 3-4; AE B at 1",
    "full_text": "1 \nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n) \nISCR Case No. 18-01955 \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government: Tara Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Ryan C. Nerney, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines B (foreign influence) \nand C (foreign preference). Applicant, a U.S. citizen, chose to become an Israeli citizen \nand to live and work in Israel for a number of years. She also has substantial retirement \nassets in an account in Israel. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 25, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines B and C. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended \n(Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \n04/30/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline C that Applicant acquired Israeli citizenship in \nAugust 1997 even though she was a U.S. citizen by birth. The SOR alleges under \nGuideline B that she has a pension fund in Israel with a value of approximately U.S. \n$109,000 and a bank account in Israel with a current balance of approximately U.S. \n$16,000. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 14, 2018, (SOR Response) and \nprovided extensive background information and a number of character references. In her \nSOR Response, she admitted each allegation of the SOR with explanations. She \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was initially assigned to \nanother judge, but on December 13, 2018, the case was reassigned to me. On January \n3, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \nscheduling the hearing to be held on January 10, 2019, via video tele-conference. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nDepartment Counsel offered two documents into evidence, which were marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. These exhibits were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. She also offered the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice regarding \nIsrael, which I have marked as Government Administrative Notice (GAN) I. Applicant had \nno objection to Department Counsel\u2019s administrative notice request. Applicant testified \nand offered 33 exhibits, which were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through GG \nand were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel also offered a \nrequest that I take administrative notice of certain additional facts regarding Israel. He \nmarked this request as AE HH, and I have remarked this as Applicant Administrative \nNotice (AAN) I. Department Counsel had no objection to Applicant\u2019s request. Two \ncharacter witnesses also testified on behalf of Applicant. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on January 25, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice  \n \nAs noted, Department Counsel and Applicant\u2019s counsel requested that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about Israel. The facts administratively noticed are \nsummarized in the Findings of Fact, below. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nBased upon Applicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR Response and a careful review of \nher testimony and that of her character witnesses, the documentary evidence admitted \ninto the record, the extensive, additional information provided by Applicant in her SOR \nResponse, and the parties\u2019 administrative notice requests, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her security clearance application, dated January 19, \n2016, (GE 1), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old software engineer, who is now specialized as a web \ndeveloper. She has worked and studied in the information technology and related fields \nfor most of her adult life. From 1997 until January 2015, she lived and worked in Israel. \nIn 1997, she obtained employment in Israel as a software engineer for a German \ncompany. She then worked as an analyst for an Israeli contractor of an international \ntechnology company. From June 2007 until January 2015, she worked as a technical \nwriter for an Israeli-based technology company. In January 2015, she relocated from \nIsrael to the United States and was unemployed for about a year. In January 2016, she \nbegan working for her security clearance sponsor. While unemployed and living in the \nUnited States, she sought employment, and for a period, she was a full-time student \ntaking classes in computer coding. (GE 2 at 3-4; SOR Response 3-4; AE B at 1; Tr. 15-\n17 and 34.) \n \n \nApplicant was born and educated in the United States. In 1980, she earned a \nbachelor\u2019s of science degree in computer science-mathematics. She has never married \nand has no children. Her mother, father, stepmother, sister, brother-in-law, and their \nchildren are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. 44.) \n \n \nIn 1997, Applicant acquired Israeli citizenship under the Israeli Aliyah program \nbased upon her Jewish heritage and her desire to live and work in Israel. She chose to \ndo this because she wanted to experience her Jewish heritage. She was about 39 years \nold at the time. In her SOR Response, she wrote that \u201cit would have been incredibly \ndifficult, probably impossible, to work for [the German company] in Israel without acquiring \ncitizenship.\u201d She testified at the hearing that she understood that it would be \u201cvery difficult \nto obtain a work visa\u201d in Israel. She provided no collaborating evidence to support her \nvague claim that becoming an Israeli citizen was \u201cprobably\u201d a prerequisite to being able \nto live and work in Israel. She noted in her SOR Response that she carefully confirmed \nthat by becoming an Israeli citizen, she would not adversely affect her status as a U.S. \ncitizen. She is presently a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen. She acquired an Israeli passport \nin 1998, which she renewed in 2010. Her passport expires in 2020. In connection with her \napplication for a security clearance, she surrendered this passport to her sponsor\u2019s \nFacility Security Officer (FSO), but when federal personnel security policy regarding \nforeign passports was revised, the FSO returned Applicant\u2019s passport to her. Applicant \nhas no intention to renew the passport when it expires.2 (GE 2 at 2-3; SOR Response 3, \n6, and 8; Tr. 21-22, 31, 35, and 41.) \n \n \nDuring the period 1989 to 1997, Applicant lived and worked in Germany for an \ninternational technology company. She was permitted to work there without becoming a \nGerman citizen. At the hearing, she speculated that she might have had a German work \nvisa, though she could not recall. She was about 31 years old when she moved to \n                                                          \n2 Applicant has not returned to Israel since January 2015, but if she does, she must enter and exit Israel \nusing her Israeli passport. Applicant\u2019s FSO testified that Applicant had no need for her passport because \nshe did not intend to return to Israel, at least as of the time she surrendered her passport to the FSO. \nApplicant testified that she has no \u201cconcrete plans\u201d to visit Israel, but she is open to doing so in the future. \nShe may have to return to Israel in 2021, however, after she turns 62 to close her pension and bank \naccounts there, which are detailed below. (GAN I at 4; Tr. 22-23 and 58-59.) \n\n \n4 \n \nGermany for that employment. She worked for the same company in the United States \nfor about two or three years before she transferred to Germany. Prior to relocating to \nIsrael in 1997, she applied for and obtained an Israeli visa and then Israeli citizenship \nunder the Aliyah program. She obtained employment with the Israeli subsidiary of the \nGerman company a number of months later. (GE 2 at 5; SOR Response 3; AE A; Tr. 36, \n43, and 45-49.) \n \n \nWhile working in Israel, Applicant and her employer contributed to a retirement \naccount, which presently has a value of U.S. $109,000. Prior to moving to Israel, she \naccumulated assets and retirement accounts held by U.S. financial institutions that are \ntoday worth more than $533,000. She also has assets in Germany worth about $6,000-\n$7,000 that she acquired while working there. She does not have any significant, non-\nfinancial assets in the United States, however, such as a residence. (Tr. 37-41 and 45-\n46.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Israeli pension account is similar to a U.S. company-sponsored 401K \nor retirement savings account. Her ability to establish and save these retirement funds \nare a benefit she received from her Israeli citizenship.3 She has chosen to leave the Israeli \nretirement assets in Israel because she would incur an Israeli tax penalty of 35 percent if \nshe withdrew the funds before she was 62 years old. She also has a bank account in \nIsrael with a balance of about U.S. $16,000. She maintains this account as a requirement \nto receive the Israeli pension funds when she turns 62 in about two years.4 At that time, \nshe intends to close both accounts and transfer the funds to the United States. She \nbelieves it would be financially irresponsible to remove the retirement funds from the \nIsraeli account at this time because of the tax penalty. She also believes that her Israeli \nassets could never be used for coercion or exploitation purposes. Although Applicant has \nstated that she is willing to renounce her Israeli citizenship, she told her FSO that she \nneeded to maintain her Israeli citizenship to be eligible to receive her retirement assets in \nIsrael. Applicant confirmed this by testifying that she would only be willing to renounce \nher Israeli citizenship if she were required to do so to obtain a U.S. security clearance \nand if she could do so after she closed her pension and bank accounts. She also testified \nthat if she renounced her Israeli citizenship, she would lose her Israeli identification \nnumber, which is needed to access her Israeli pension and bank accounts.5 (SOR \nResponse 6 and 8; Tr. 22-23, 27, 37-41, and 58-60.) \n \n \nSince returning to the United States after living abroad for most of her adult life, 17 \nyears of which were in Israel, Applicant moved to a location far from where her parents \nand sister reside. She moved there to take classes in computer coding. She visits her \n                                                          \n3 The SOR does not contain any allegations regarding Applicant\u2019s exercise of the rights and benefits she \nreceived as an Israeli citizen. \n \n4 Applicant also testified that she left funds in that account for her future use if she returns to visit Israel. (Tr. \n58-59.) \n \n5 Applicant also testified that if she were to renounce her Israeli citizenship, she could probably reapply \nunder the Aliyah program and obtain Israeli citizenship again. (Tr. 51-52.) \n\n \n5 \n \nfamily members once or twice a year. Applicant has become involved in a local folk-\ndancing community. She teaches and participates in several different kinds of dance \nclasses and clubs and socializes with the other participants. The record evidence contains \na large number of highly favorable reference letters. In addition, her sponsor\u2019s FSO and \nher supervisor provided favorable testimony at the hearing regarding Applicant\u2019s work \nethic, character, trustworthiness, and loyalty and connections to her country of birth, the \nUnited States. (SOR Response 4 and 9; Tr. 52.) \n \nIsrael \n \n \nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral parliament called the \nKnesset and a prime minister, who exercises extensive executive power. Members of the \nKnesset, including the prime minister, are elected in free and fair elections. The United \nStates recognized Israel as an independent state on May 14, 1948, and established \ndiplomatic relations with Israel the following year. The United States and Israel have had \nstrong bilateral relations since that period. The United States extends substantial foreign \naid to Israel and provides significant military support as well. The United States is also \nIsrael\u2019s largest trading partner. Israel cooperates closely with the United States and other \ncountries on counterterrorism issues. (AAN I at 2-7; GAN I at 2.) \n \nDespite its close relationship with the United States, Israeli has been involved in \nnumerous instances of illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of U.S. restricted and \nclassified technology and products, including dual-use technology. The illegally \ntransferred technology and products obtained for Israel\u2019s benefit includes spy software, \nencryption software, parts for fighter jets, components of U.S. HAWK surface-to-air \nmissiles and F-4 Phantom fighter jets, and digital oscilloscopes capable of being used in \nthe development of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery. (GAN I at 2-3.) \n \nIsrael generally respects the rights of its citizens. When human-rights violations \nhave occurred, they have involved Palestinian detainees or Arab-Israelis. Terrorist \nsuicide bombings are a continuing threat in Israel, and U.S. citizens in Israel are advised \nto be cautious. (GAN I at 3-5.) \n \nIsrael considers U.S. citizens, who also hold Israeli citizenship or have a claim to \ndual nationality, to be Israeli citizens for immigration and other legal purposes. Dual \nU.S.-Israeli citizens must enter and depart Israel using Israeli passports. U.S. citizens \nvisiting Israel have been subjected to prolonged questioning and thorough searches by \nIsraeli authorities upon entry or departure. (GAN I at 4-5.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n6 \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR contains one allegation under Guideline C. It alleges that Applicant \nacquired Israeli citizenship in August 1997, even though she was a U.S. citizen by birth. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.)  \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9, as follows: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact \nthat a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying \nwithout an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. \nThe same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or privilege of \nforeign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR Response and the record evidence establish \nthe following potentially disqualifying condition: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 10(a): applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country. \n \nIt is important to note that dual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant \nan adverse security clearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 1999). The admitted fact that Applicant, \na U.S. citizen, acquired Israeli citizenship is potentially disqualifying under this \nadjudicative guideline because her actions may show a preference for Israel over the \nUnited States. \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is not limited to countries hostile to the \nU.S. \u201cUnder the facts of a given case, an applicant\u2019s preference, explicit or implied, even \nfor a nation with which the U.S. has enjoyed long and peaceful relations, might pose a \nchallenge to U.S. interests.\u201d ADP Case No. 07-14939 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2009). AG \n\u00b6 10(a) makes this point by specifically referencing the act of acquiring citizenship \u201cin any \nother country.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 11(a): the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national \nsecurity interests; \n \nAG \u00b6 11(b): dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth \nin a foreign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference; \n \nAG \u00b6 11(c): the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the \nforeign citizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; \n \nAG \u00b6 11(d): the exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before individual became a U.S. citizen; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 11(e): the exercise of the entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship \ndo not present a national security concern; \n \nAG \u00b6 11(f): the foreign preference, if detected, involves a foreign country, \nentity, or association that presents a low national security risk; \n \nAG \u00b6 11(g): civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. \nlaw, or the employment or service was otherwise consented to as required \nby U.S. law; and \n \nAG \u00b6 11(h): any potentially disqualifying activity took place after receiving \nthe approval by the agency head or designee. \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b), (g), and (h) have no application \nunder the facts of this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a), (c), (d), (e), and (f) have potential application \nand are discussed further below.  \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline \u00b6 11(a) has been partially established by the undisputed \nfact that the United States enjoys friendly relations with Israel. As noted above, however, \nthe nature of the relations between the United States and Israel is not determinative. \nUnder the facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s expertise and employment in the area of \ninformation technology, both in Israel and now in the United States, raises the potential \nthat her decision to become an Israeli citizen could create a conflict with U.S. national \nsecurity interests. This conflict is illustrated by the pattern of numerous incidents over a \nnumber of years of U.S. export-controlled technologies being illegally imported by Israel \nand Israeli companies. In the circumstances of this case, Applicant\u2019s choice to become \nan Israeli citizen creates a potential conflict with U.S. national security interests. \nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 11(a) does  not fully apply. \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline \u00b6 11(c) has been partially established because Applicant \nhas expressed a willingness to renounce her Israeli citizenship. She, however, failed to \n\n \n9 \n \nestablish that it would be \u201cfinancial responsible,\u201d in her words, to do so if her renunciation \nof her citizenship could result in her loss of eligibility to collect her retirement account in \nIsrael. Her FSO testified that Applicant admitted to her that Applicant maintains her Israeli \ncitizenship so she can collect her pension in Israel when she turns 62. Applicant \nconfirmed that she would lose her pension and bank accounts if she renounced her Israeli \ncitizenship before she closed those accounts at age 62.  \n \nTo render Applicant\u2019s stated willingness to renounce her Israeli citizenship more \nthan just words, she has the burden to prove that if she renounces her Israeli citizenship, \nshe could still collect her retirement account as a U.S. citizen or be willing to accept the \nloss of her Israeli retirement and bank accounts. Her testimony does not support either \noption. Moreover, she offered no evidence that she had even looked into the procedures \nfor renunciation under Israeli law and the other possible consequences or taxes that \nmight be imposed on her by the Israeli government if she did renounce her Israeli \ncitizenship, or whether it is even possible to do so under Israeli law.  \n \nFurthermore, Applicant presented no evidence that she could not have applied for \nan Israeli work visa to live and work in Israel as a U.S. citizen, especially as a U.S. citizen \nwith valuable skills and experience in the information technology field. Her claim that her \nonly alternative to achieve her desire to experience her Jewish heritage by living and \nworking in Israel was to become an Israeli citizen required corroborating evidence that \nwas not forthcoming. The absence of such evidence raises significant issues that her \nchoice to become an Israeli citizen was a matter of preference rather than necessity for \nher to live and work in Israel. Under the facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s expressed \nwillingness to renounce her Israeli citizenship does not carry the same weight as it would \nfor someone who obtained foreign citizenship by birth in a foreign country or through \nparents who are foreign citizens.  \n \nAdjudicative Guideline \u00b6 11(d) is not applicable under the facts of this case. The \nSOR does not allege Applicant\u2019s exercise of her rights and privileges as an Israeli citizen.6 \nAlso, as a U.S. citizen by birth in this country, Applicant exercised the rights and privileges \nof her Israeli citizenship after, not before, she obtained her U.S. citizenship. This fact \nnegates the application of this mitigating condition. \n \nAdjudicative Guideline \u00b6 11(e) is applicable under the facts of this case. Separately \nconsidered, Applicant\u2019s exercise of the entitlements and benefits of her Israeli citizenship \ndo not present a national security concern. As noted, however, the SOR contains no \nallegations regarding Applicant\u2019s exercise of the entitlements and benefits of her Israeli \n                                                          \n6 Although the SOR does not allege Applicant\u2019s exercise of the rights and benefits of Israeli citizenship as \na disqualifying fact, the record reflects that in addition to accumulating a tax-advantaged pension account \nin Israel, she voted in Israeli elections, and as noted above, she maintains her Israeli citizenship to qualify \nto receive her Israeli pension when she turns 62. I also note that the record is silent as to whether Applicant \nis entitled to receive a pension from the Israeli government as a result of her 17 years of employment in \nthat country. In light of the single SOR allegation under Guideline C regarding her acquiring Israeli \ncitizenship in 1997, I have not considered Applicant\u2019s exercise of her rights and benefits as an Israeli citizen \nas potentially disqualifying. \n\n \n10 \n \ncitizenship as disqualifying facts. As a result, this adjudicative guideline has no bearing \non the security concerns alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 11(f) is not established. I have taken administrative notice \nof facts set forth above that demonstrate that under the facts of this case, Israel does not \npresent a low national security risk. Applicant\u2019s education, expertise, and experience in \nthe information technology field combined with Israel\u2019s extensive history of illegally \nacquiring U.S. technology undercuts a favorable mitigation conclusion under this \nadjudicative guideline. If Applicant was an elementary school teacher, a college professor \nof English literature, or a dance instructor, the analysis under this guideline might be \ndifferent. Granting Applicant a security clearance so that she can work as a defense \ncontractor on classified contracts creates a risk that any preference she holds for Israel \ncould harm U.S. national security. The nature of the national security risk presented by \nthe facts in this case cannot be characterized as \u201clow.\u201d \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR sets forth two allegations under Guideline B regarding Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial assets in Israel. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6, \nas follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe evidence establishes the following potentially disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat creates a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest. \n \n\n \n11 \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR Response of the two Guideline B allegations in \nthe SOR and her testimony regarding her financial assets in Israel establish these \npotentially disqualifying security concerns. The amount of the assets in Israel is large \nenough to create a heightened risk of a personal conflict of interest. \n \n \nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s refusal to incur a tax penalty in Israel by withdrawing the assets in her \nIsraeli retirement account to mitigate security concerns under this guideline suggest that \neven 35 percent of her retirement assets are sufficiently important to her to give rise to a \npotential conflict of interest. The Israeli assets represent about one-sixth of her overall \nassets. If she were to forfeit them or otherwise lose them, she would have a limited \nopportunity at age 60 to reacquire assets of this magnitude for her retirement. The value \nof Applicant\u2019s assets in Israel are sufficiently large to preclude a conclusion that they are \nunlikely to result in a personal conflict of interest. Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 8(f) is not \nestablished. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).7  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines C and B in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines \nand evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by her acquiring Israeli citizenship and by \nher significant financial assets in Israel. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n7 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n___________ \nDecision \n___________ \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana once in August 2015 and once in August \n2017 while holding a security clearance. Guideline H (drug involvement and substance \nmisuse) security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied.      \nHistory of the Case \nOn October 2, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On August 22, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR \nset forth security concerns arising under Guideline H. \n04/23/2019\n\n \n2                                         \n \nOn September 6, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a \nhearing. (HE 3) On February 9, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On March 11, 2019, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s \nhearing for March 28, 2019. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled using video \nteleconference.  \n  \nDepartment Counsel offered two exhibits; Applicant provided a comprehensive \nSOR response with five attachments; there were no objections to the documents; and \nthey were admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 11, 14-17; GE 1-2; SOR response) On \nApril 10, 2019, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing (Tr.).    \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n(HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old mechanical engineer specializing in software, and a \nmajor defense contractor has employed him for the previous seven years. (Tr. 6, 19) In \n2006, he graduated from high school, and in 2010, he graduated Summa Cum Laude and \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. (Tr. 6; SOR response \u00b6 3.2) In \n2014, he received a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. (Tr. 6) He earned two \npost-graduate certifications, and has an impressive professional work history. (SOR \nresponse \u00b6\u00b6 3.2-3.4) He has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) In 2010, he married, and \nhis children are ages 2 and 5. (Tr. 7)   \n \nApplicant provided character-reference statements from 16 colleagues who have \nworked with him for several years. (SOR response \u00b6\u00b6 3.5.1-3.5.16) His awards, \nperformance \nevaluations, \nand \ncharacter \nstatements \nestablish \nhis \nintegrity, \nprofessionalism, diligence, responsibility, trustworthiness, and contributions to mission \naccomplishment. (SOR response \u00b6\u00b6 3.5.1-3.9 and Attach. D, E)  \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \nApplicant did not timely disclose his marijuana use because he did not think about \nhis duty to disclose that information to his security officer. (Tr. 25) In Appellant\u2019s October \n2, 2017 SCA, he admitted use of marijuana on two occasions on float trips2 in August \n2015 and August 2017. (GE 1) He said he took one \u201chit\u201d from a marijuana cigarette on \nboth occasions, and he did not enjoy his marijuana use. (GE 1) Applicant\u2019s statement \nduring his Office of Personnel Management personal subject interview, in his SOR \nresponse, and at his hearing were all consistent with his disclosure of marijuana use in \nhis October 2, 2017 SCA. (SOR response, GE 1, GE 2) \n \n                                            \n1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific information is available \nin the cited exhibits. \n \n2 A \u201cfloat trip\u201d involves canoeing and rafting on a river. (Tr. 20) \n\n \n3                                         \n \nApplicant used marijuana because of peer pressure and curiosity, and he \nacknowledged his marijuana use showed poor judgment. (Tr. 22, 24; SOR response) He \ndisclosed the only times he used marijuana on his SCA. (Tr. 24) He does not associate \nwith users of illegal drugs. (Tr. 26; SOR response \u00b6 2.2.1.) He met with a counselor on \ntwo occasions for an evaluation; however, the counselor indicated there was no evidence \nof drug addiction, and therefore, no counseling was needed. (Tr. 26-27; SOR response \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.2, 2.4) He has had opportunities to use marijuana after August 2017, and he declined \nthe invitations to use marijuana. (Tr. 28-29)  \n \nOn August 31, 2018, Applicant\u2019s hair was tested for the presence of the marijuana \nmetabolite, and the result was negative, indicating no marijuana use in the previous 90 \ndays. (SOR response \u00b6 2.1; Attach. A)  \n \nApplicant \u201cproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (SOR response, Attach. B); see \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(3). Applicant does not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 30) He \npromised not to compromise national security. (Tr. 30)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n4                                         \n \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for drug involvement: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI) Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence \nto Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \n\n \n5                                         \n \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance . . . .\u201d; and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d Applicant possessed and \nused marijuana3 on a total of two occasions in August 2015, and August 2017, while \nholding a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) are established.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n                                            \n \n3 Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substances. See Drug Enforcement \nAdministration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales \nv. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). \n\n \n6                                         \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant provided some mitigating information. He ended his marijuana \npossession and use in August 2017, and he does not associate with marijuana users. He \nsubmitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. He understands that marijuana involvement is inconsistent \nwith holding a security clearance. He promised not to use marijuana in the future.  \n \nThere is no bright-line test for how much time must elapse after ending marijuana \nuse while holding a security clearance to establish that future marijuana use \u201cis unlikely \nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). The Appeal Board affirmed the denial of a security clearance \nfor an Applicant holding a security clearance who abstained from marijuana use for 21 \nmonths before his security clearance hearing. ISCR Case No. 14-03450 (App. Bd. Sept. \n11, 2015). In another case involving an Applicant with a history of frequent marijuana use, \nincluding while holding a security clearance, the Appeal Board affirmed denial of a \nsecurity clearance after the passage of almost five years since the most recent marijuana \nuse. ISCR Case No. 15-06277 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 19, 2017) (\u201cThe extent to which \nsecurity concerns have become mitigated through the passage of time is a question that \nmust be resolved based on the evidence as a whole. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01847 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2015). Applicant\u2019s drug use after having completed a clearance \napplication and after having been granted a clearance is a significant factor in evaluating \nhis judgment and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, \n2015).\u201d). See also ISCR Case No. 06-18905 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 2007) (reversing \ngrant of security clearance for Applicant who ended marijuana use while holding a \nsecurity clearance 30 months before hearing).  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns is substantial. Applicant possessed and used marijuana once in August 2015 \nand once in August 2017 while holding a security clearance. Each time he possessed \nmarijuana, he committed a federal crime. His marijuana use in August 2017 is recent. \nMore time must elapse without possession and use of illegal drugs before security \n\n \n7                                         \n \nconcerns are alleviated. Drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are \nnot mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old mechanical engineer specializing in software, and a \nmajor defense contractor has employed him for the previous seven years. In 2010, he \ngraduated Summa Cum Laude and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical \nengineering. In 2014, he received a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. He \nearned two post-graduate certifications, and has an impressive professional work history. \nApplicant provided character-reference statements from 16 colleagues who have worked \nwith him for several years. His awards, performance evaluations, and character \nstatements \nestablish \nhis \nintegrity, \nprofessionalism, \ndiligence, \nresponsibility, \ntrustworthiness, and contributions to mission accomplishment. He is credited with being \nan intelligent, honest, and dedicated professional mechanical engineer who has the \npotential of making significant future contributions to national security.   \n \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed his marijuana use on his SCA. His voluntary \ndisclosure enhances his credibility and increases his trustworthiness and reliability. His \nmarijuana use on only two occasions tends to indicate he will not use marijuana in the \nfuture. He is not addicted to marijuana and drug counseling is unnecessary. He promised \nnot to use marijuana in the future. \n \nThe evidence against granting Applicant\u2019s security clearance is more persuasive \nat this time. Applicant possessed and used marijuana on two occasions\u2014August 2015 \nand August 2017. His marijuana use is somewhat recent. Each time he possessed \nmarijuana, he committed a federal crime. His marijuana possession and use \u201craise \n\n \n8                                         \n \nquestions about [his] ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 24.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security \nclearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time. More time without misuse of illegal \ndrugs is necessary to fully mitigate security concerns.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, and the \nAGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Guideline H \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He was afforded a period \n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nof 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nOn November 7, 2018, Applicant timely submitted an eight-page response to the \nFORM. On December 20, 2018, the case was assigned to me. Department Counsel \nsubmitted five documents with his FORM, marked as Items 1 through 5. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to FORM is marked Item 6. Items 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nBackground Information \nApplicant is a 59-year-old maintenance worker employed by a defense contractor \nsince 2017. (Item 3) He seeks a security clearance in conjunction with his current \nemployment.    \nApplicant received his GED \u201csometime between 1994 and 1996.\u201d (Item 3) He \nwas awarded an associate\u2019s degree in 2012 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. Applicant \nhas never married, and has an adult son (Items 2, 3)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s two delinquent SOR debts comprise a $44,367 student loan collection \naccount and a $20,436 child support collection account. Applicant acknowledged these \ndebts in his SOR answer. They are further established by his June 2017 and October \n2018 credit reports as well as by his Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject \nInterview (OPM PSI) conducted in February 2018. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 l.b; Items 1, 4, 5) \n \n \nDuring his OPM PSI, Applicant stated that he was unable to repay his student \nloan because he was not making enough money. During that interview, he also stated \nthat he planned to contact the Department of Education by the end of February 2018 to \nset up a payment plan and hoped to have the account current by December 2020. (Item \n3) In his SOR answer, he attributed this debt to \u201cnaivety and procrastination.\u201d He added \nthat he \u201cobtained a payment plan from the agency that allows me to return to my original \nlender next year.\u201d (Item 1) According to his two credit reports, Applicant\u2019s student loan \naccount has been delinquent since 2017. (Items 4, 5) Applicant stated in his response \nto FORM, \u201cI have already beg[u]n payments with a creditor to reestablish [sic] my \nschool loan.\u201d (Item 6) \n \nAlso during his OPM PSI, Applicant stated that his child support account became \ndelinquent in 1994 and at that time he owed approximately $8,000. He stated that his \npaycheck was being garnished and his tax refunds were withheld. In 2006, he was \ninformed by the court that his child support arrearages had increased to $30,000. \nApplicant disputed that amount because his pay was being garnished and his tax \nrefunds were being withheld. Applicant had taken no further action to resolve the matter \nsince 2006 because he could not afford a lawyer and his paycheck was still being \ngarnished for child support arrearages. He stated that he intended to get this debt \nresolved, but was unable to afford a lawyer. (Item 3) In his SOR answer, Applicant \nstated, \u201cI have a payment plan with the state of [\u2026] since, I believe, 1994 on my child \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nsupport, therefore, that not only shows my intention of fully paying this debt but also \nmade me current.\u201d (Item 1). In Applicant\u2019s FORM response, he stated that he \u201cwill be \nspeaking with an attorney next week to reduce or expunge my child support.\u201d (Item 6)  \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM discussed specific shortcomings of Applicant\u2019s \nSOR answer, and emphasized long-standing DOHA case law concerning the necessity \nfor applicants to provide mitigating documentation. Applicant submitted numerous \nfavorable whole-person work-related evidence; however, he failed to submit any \ndocumentation that addressed the two SOR debts.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his May 2017 SF-86, he failed to disclose his student \nloan collection account and his child support collection account, as required. He denied \nthat he intentionally omitted disclosure of these delinquent debts, claiming oversight or \nmisinterpreting the questions. In reviewing his OPM PSI, I note that he also failed to list \nother required information or provided incorrect information on his SF-86, such as \nincomplete identifying information, information related to his residence, an incorrect \nschool name, mistakes or incorrect information about his employment, and incorrect or \nincomplete information regarging alcohol issues. I also note that he provided adverse \ninformation concerning his criminal history. (Items 2, 3) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d Based on the information in the SOR, the record \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c).   \n  \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potentially mitigating conditions under these facts: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n  \nThe Appeal Board explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility to prove applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nWith regard to financial considerations, no mitigating conditions fully apply. In \naddition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate adjudicative factors under \nGuideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed for the majority of his \nadult life, and he is presumed to be a mature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without \nsufficient information suggesting that his long-standing financial problems are being \naddressed, doubts remain about his suitability for access to classified information. \nProtection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications. \nAccording, those doubts must be resolved against Applicant. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nApplicant admitted that, when he completed his SF-86, he failed to list his \nstudent loan collection account and his child support collection account, as required. He \ndenied that he intentionally omitted these debts, claiming oversight or misinterpreting \nthe questions. I also note that he made other mistakes or failed to report required \ninformation when completing his SF-86. He discussed these shortcomings during his \nOPM PSI. Based on the available information, it appears Applicant became confused \nwhen completing his SF-86. His lack of attention to detail cannot be construed as a \nwillful and deliberate attempt to undermine the investigative process. Although the \ninformation he provided regarding his financial situation, and other issues, on his SF-86 \nproved to be incorrect, I attribute these lapses to carelessness and am satisfied that he \ndid not deliberately and intentionally fail to disclose his delinquent debts with the intent \nto deceive.1 No disqualifying condition under Guideline E was established in this record, \nand discussion of potentially mitigating conditions is not warranted. \n \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, he failed to submit \nsufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding \nhis circumstances, articulate his position, or mitigate the financial security concerns. He \nfailed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation regarding his \nefforts to address his delinquent debt. By failing to provide such information, financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain. \n \n \n                                                          \n1 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd.

Cervi, Administrative Judge \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 20, 2017. On \nAugust 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on \nJune 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 11, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge. Another Administrative Judge was assigned and \nscheduled a hearing for January 18, 2019. On January 14, 2019, Applicant notified the \n\n \n2 \n \nAdministrative Judge and Department Counsel that he no longer wanted a hearing, and \nrequested a decision based on the written record. The Government\u2019s written brief with \nsupporting documents, known as the File of Relevant Material (FORM), was submitted \nby Department Counsel on January 30, 2019. The case was assigned to me on May 29, \n2019. \n \nA complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM but did not submit a response. \nGovernment exhibits (GE) 1 to 6 are admitted into evidence. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old network administrator, employed by a defense \ncontractor since March 2017. He was previously employed by another contractor from \nJanuary 2016 to March 2016, and reported periods of unemployment, including from April \n2016 to March 2017. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1993 and a master\u2019s degree in \n2005. He married in 1998 and divorced in 2003. He has one child. He does not currently \nhold a security clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts: a child-support arrearage; a collection \naccount; and two judgments totaling about $96,319. Applicant admitted SOR 1.a (child \nsupport) and 1.c (judgment), and denied SOR 1.b (collection) and 1.d (apartment \njudgment), with explanations. All of the SOR debts are supported by substantial evidence \nin the record. \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant noted that his debts became delinquent as a \nresult of an inconsistent work history. He stated that he is the victim of a combination of \nmany years of a poor economy, living in a poor location for his skill set, being \noverqualified, and jobs in his career field being moved overseas. \n \nSOR 1.a involves Applicant\u2019s child-support arrearage with interest charges, \nresulting in a past-due balance of $69,089. Applicant claimed to have a history of paying \ntoward this debt when he is employed, and he communicates with the agency regularly. \nHe did not provide documentary evidence supporting past payments or recent efforts to \nresolve the debt. The debt remains unresolved.  \n \nSOR 1.b is a delinquent cell phone provider account. Applicant claimed that the \ndebt was resolved and he could provide proof \u201cupon request.\u201d No such documentary \nevidence proof was provided. SOR 1.c is a loan obtained to start a mobile entertainment \nbusiness in 2007. The business failed in 2008, and the debt was reduced to a judgment. \nIt remains unpaid. SOR 1.d is a judgment from a debt from an apartment rental. Applicant \nprovided evidence that the debt was paid in 2015. \n \nNo evidence of credit counseling, current financial status, or other mitigating \nevidence was provided. \n\n \n3 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n \n4 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record supporting the \nSOR allegations are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n5 \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s unresolved debts have been a recurring problem that have not been \nsufficiently addressed. Although Applicant generally claims his irregular work history \nresulted in his inability to satisfy debts, he has not shown good-faith efforts to resolve \nthree unpaid debts and a stable financial status. I have insufficient evidence of Applicant\u2019s \nability or willingness to satisfy his current financial obligations and pay the delinquent \ndebts to which he is responsible, even though he has been employed since 2017. SOR \n1.d was satisfied. \n \nApplicant\u2019s long-standing delinquent debts without a plan and good-faith efforts \ntoward their resolution, raise significant doubts about his financial responsibility and he \nhas not shown that continued financial problems are unlikely to recur. No mitigating \ncondition fully applies to the remaining unresolved debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG 2(d). \n \n \nAlthough adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient \nfor an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be found ineligible if \n\n \n6 \n \navailable information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, \nirresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquencies remain an ongoing concern. He has not shown evidence of whole-person \nfactors sufficient to overcome the financial concerns. Accordingly, I conclude he has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Nerney, Esq., and Alan V. Edmunds, Esq.  \n \n09/12/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence shows a long-standing pattern of \nfinancial problems, which are largely unresolved and ongoing. The evidence is not \nsufficient to mitigate his history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non January 21, 2016. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on August 15, 2018, after reviewing the application \nand the information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \n\n \n2 \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  \n \nWith assistance of counsel, Applicant answered the SOR on October 18, 2018. \nHe admitted, with explanations, seven of the eight factual allegations in the SOR. His \nanswer consisted of a seven-page memorandum along with proposed Exhibits A-G. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on April 16, 2019. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on June 11, 2019. Applicant appeared with counsel. Department Counsel \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-7. Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-Q. Other than Applicant, no \nwitnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on June 20, 2019. \n \nThe record was kept open until July 11, 2019, to provide Applicant an opportunity \nto submit additional documentation. At Applicant\u2019s request, the deadline was extended \nto August 12, 2019, and then extended again to August 21, 2019. On August 19, 2019, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested, by e-mail, that I close the record. In other words, \nApplicant did not submit any post-hearing matters.     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is seeking to obtain a security clearance, although he has held a \nsecurity clearance in the past. (Tr. 5-6) He works as a principal systems engineer for a \nlarge company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since October 2017. \nHis formal education includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering awarded \nin 1997, and a master\u2019s degree in systems engineering awarded in 2011. He is 51, \nmarried, and has a 19-year-old stepdaughter.   \n \nAs reflected in his security clearance application, Applicant\u2019s employment history \nis a bit irregular, in that he has held multiple jobs in several locations over the last \ndecade. (Exhibit 1) Since completion of his master\u2019s degree in 2011, he has had three \nperiods of unemployment: (1) from April 2012 to September 2012, a period of about six \nmonths; (2) from December 2012 to March 2013, when he decided to take some time \noff after his father passed away in November 2012; and (3) from February 2017 until \nOctober 2017, when he began his current employment. His employment history \nincludes federal employment as a mechanical engineer for the U.S. Navy during 2002-\n2006, when he was granted the privilege of a security clearance in September 2002. \n(Exhibit 1 at 44) \n   \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. The \nSOR allegations consisted of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, filed in 2005 and discharged \nin 2006, and seven delinquent accounts, either charged off or in collection, ranging in \namounts from $314 to $15,139 for a total of about $57,681. In his answer, he denied the \n$314 collection account and indicated he was suing in small claims court to rectify the \nmatter. In addition to his admissions, the matters in the SOR are established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 3-7)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant attributed the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case to a business failure. (Tr. 21-\n29) He bought a business (a gas station) in about 1999 or 2000, the business was not \nprofitable, and it failed about a year after the purchase. Applicant stated that the \nbusiness failure was due to the seller\u2019s deliberate overstatement or misrepresentation of \nthe business\u2019s financials. He delayed filing the bankruptcy case until 2005 because he \nwanted to pay his debts. The bankruptcy paperwork shows he claimed $87,307 in \nliabilities of which $79,400 was unsecured indebtedness. (Exhibit 3)  \n \nPost-bankruptcy, Applicant attributed his financial problems to periodic \nunemployment as well as the time, effort, and money he devoted over a period of years \nproviding care for his ailing father, who eventually passed away in November 2012. (Tr. \n29-34, 74-75) Per his security clearance application, he reported full-time employment \nfor a state government as a caregiver from March 2008 to October 2011. (Exhibit 1 at \n23) He also explained that his ability to resolve his financial problems was hindered by a \nloss of documents due to storm damage from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. (Tr. 36-37; \nExhibit E) \n \nConcerning the seven delinquent accounts for about $57,681, Applicant \nestablished that he settled the $1,282 charged-off account for $400 in October 2018, \nand paid in full the $1,253 charged-off account in July 2018. (Exhibits K and J, \nrespectively; Tr. 51-54) Applicant did not present documentation to show that the five \nremaining delinquent accounts were paid, settled, compromised, in a payment \narrangement, cancelled, or forgiven.  \n \nApplicant disputes the validity of the $314 collection account, which stems from a \nclaim of money owed after he vacated an apartment. (Tr. 54-58) He claims the \napartment was in good condition when he vacated, and he refuses to pay the debt. In \nMay 2019, he initiated a small-claims court action suing the creditor. (Exhibit Q) \n \nThree of the delinquent accounts are with the same creditor, a federal credit \nunion, consisting of a charged-off account for $13,506, a charged-off account for \n$12,916, and a collection account for $15,139. (Tr. 37-46, 75-80) The delinquent \naccounts are reflected in credit reports from February 2016, October 2017, June 2018, \nand November 2018. (Exhibits 4-7) The $15,139 collection account is not reflected in \nthe most recent credit reports from 2018, while the two charged-off accounts are \nreflected in all four credit reports. Applicant discussed these accounts at length during \nthe hearing, he disputed the validity of a third delinquent account with the credit union, \nbut I found his testimony to be unclear. Given the ambiguity, and based on the clarity of \nthe four credit reports, I find the current existence of the two charged-off accounts for \n$13,506 and $12,916, but not the $15,139 collection account. Applicant stated that he \nmade some efforts to resolve the accounts, including an impromptu in-person inquiry at \na branch office of the credit union. (Tr. 77-80) But the two charged-off accounts are still \noutstanding, and Applicant did not have a plan in place to address them. The two \ncharged-off accounts are unresolved.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe other delinquent account is a $13,271 charged-off account stemming from a \ndeficiency balance on an automobile loan after involuntary repossession. (Tr. 46-51, 63-\n73) Applicant purchased the vehicle in 2015 for his job at the time. He made the \nmonthly payments on the loan until he defaulted in about June 2017, which was during \nhis most recent period of unemployment from February 2017 until October 2017. He did \nnot make any payments on the deficiency balance, leading to the charged-off account. \nApplicant stated that the account was purchased by another creditor, and that he will do \nhis best to resolve it. The account is unresolved.  \n \nApplicant stated that his current financial situation is under control, that he is \nmeeting his current living expenses, and he is not incurring new delinquent debts. (Tr. \n58-60) His annual salary is about $135,000. His wife is not employed outside the home. \nHe has a 401(k) account with a balance of about $22,000. He reported having about \n$1,500 in a checking account and two paid-off automobiles. A checking account \nstatement reflected a balance of $2,540 as of April 30, 2019. (Exhibit H) \n  \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n\n \n5 \n \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nWith that said, it is important to note that a security clearance case is not a debt-\ncollection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt \nalleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement \nthat an applicant make payments on all the delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is \nthere a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n                                                          \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n6 \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTo begin discussion of the delinquent accounts, I am not concerned about the \nunpaid $314 collection account stemming from the apartment rental. Applicant disputes \nthe validity of the debt under the terms of AG \u00b6 20(e), and experience teaches that such \ndebts are often bogus. More to the point, the debt is so minor that it does not raise a \nconcern, either alone or together with the other delinquent accounts. It is resolved under \nthe mighty legal doctrine of de minimis non curat lex (= the law does not concern itself \nwith trifles).  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are due to a \ncombination of factors: (1) the business failure in the early 2000s, which led to the 2005-\n2006 Chapter 7 bankruptcy; (2) the time, effort, and money he devoted caring for his \nailing father over a period of years, which ended with his father\u2019s passing in November \n2012; and (3) his three periods of unemployment during 2012-2017. Those \ncircumstances were largely beyond his control. Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances by seeking employment and attempting to pay his debts. Nevertheless, \ndespite full-time work since October 2017, the financial problems persist to this day, as \nevidenced by the remaining three charged-off accounts in amounts of $13,506, \n$13,271, and $12,916, for a total of nearly $40,000. Given the circumstances, the \nmitigation condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part, but Applicant does not receive full \ncredit in mitigation.    \n \n \nIt is too soon to tell if Applicant will initiate and adhere to a good-faith effort to \nresolve the remaining delinquent debts. With that said, he receives credit for the \nprogress he made in 2018 for paying off or settling the two smallest charged-off \naccounts for a total of less than $2,000. But Applicant is still facing a small mountain of \ndelinquent debt, nearly $40,000 for the three charged-off accounts. The record does not \nsupport a conclusion that he can formulate a realistic plan and then follow through on \nthat plan to address the indebtedness. Indeed, I got the impression that he intended to \ndo nothing further with the charged-off accounts with the credit union. In light of the \nhigh-dollar amount and age of some of the debts, it is unlikely that those debts will ever \n\n \n7 \n \nbe paid. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply \nin Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant presented some evidence in mitigation, I am not persuaded \nthat he is making an honest effort to repay his creditors for the three remaining charged-\noff accounts for nearly $40,000. There are not clear indications that he is repaying the \nthree charged-off accounts, or that he has realistic plans to do so in the near future. \nTaking everything into account, the evidence shows a long-standing pattern of financial \nproblems, which are largely unresolved and ongoing. The evidence is not sufficient to \nmitigate his history of financial problems. The financial considerations concern is not \nmitigated.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/31/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the decision of the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) that it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. The \nDOD CAF alleges in its Statement of Reasons (SOR) that Applicant has significant \ncontacts with Chinese citizens and used a Chinese-based online chat program to meet \nChinese women who resided in China. Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient to \nsupport a favorable decision. Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is revoked. \nStatement of the Case \nIn March 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in \nconnection with the periodic review of his security clearance, which he has held since \nabout 2005. Following an investigation, the DOD CAF issued its SOR on September 7, \n2018, setting forth allegations under Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant timely \n\n   2 \nresponded to the SOR and requested a decision based upon the written record in lieu of \na hearing. He was living and working in Africa at the time. \nOn April 22, 2019, Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) with seven government exhibits (GE) attached along with a request for \nadministrative notice with respect to the People\u2019s Republic of China (China). Applicant \nreceived the FORM on April 27, 2019, and over the period May 2-29, 2019, he submitted \nmultiple responses to the FORM in emails and sometimes with attached documents. On \nJune 18, 2019, the case was assigned to me. Absent any objection, all of the parties\u2019 \ndocumentary evidence is admitted into the record.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn his SOR response, Applicant denied the first two SOR allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b, and admitted the remaining allegation, SOR \u00b6 1.c. He also provided some \nadditional information. I have incorporated his admissions in my findings of fact. \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA, FORM Item 5, and a \nNovember 2010 security clearance application (2010 SCA), FORM Item 4, unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.  \nSince 2004, Applicant, 60, has worked as a contractor in U.S. facilities in overseas \nlocations, including two years in Beijing, China (2006-2008). He has a high school \ndiploma. He was granted a security clearance in 2005, which was reviewed and continued \nin 2010-11. (FORM response at 26-28.) \nApplicant\u2019s marital history is complicated, and his marital status has changed since \nhe submitted his SCA in March 2016. He married his first wife, a U.S.-born citizen, in \n1986. They divorced in 1995, but then remarried in 1999 only to separate a year later and \ndivorce again. They have three children, who are all adults at this time.  \nIn April 2008, Applicant married a Chinese citizen and resident, who he met in \n2007 while working in China. They dated in China for about six months until his security \nofficer imposed a cease and desist order, requiring Applicant to terminate all contact with \nthis woman or lose his clearance and job. He chose to stop seeing her, though when his \ncontract in China ended in October 2007, they reconnected and married in China in April \n2008. Applicant\u2019s second wife, who was 24 years old when they married, received her \nvisa to enter the United States in March 2009. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \n2014. They have one child, who was born in the United States in 2010. His wife had a \nsecond child two years later. This child was fathered by an illegal immigrant from Latin \nAmerica, who the second wife met in an English class. Applicant\u2019s wife had an ongoing \naffair with this person since 2011. The second child has Applicant\u2019s last name, and \nApplicant refers to the child as his child. At one point, the lover of his second wife moved \ninto Applicant\u2019s house while Applicant worked overseas. Applicant and his second wife \ndivorced in August 2017. She married her lover a week later. She has told Applicant that \n\n   3 \nonce her new husband becomes a legal U.S. resident alien, she wants to divorce him and \nremarry Applicant. (FORM response at 26; FORM Exhibit 7 at 2, 9; FORM Exhibit 6 at 2, \n4; FORM Item 3 at 2, 4.) \nBeginning in April 2009, the mother of Applicant\u2019s second wife spent part of each \nyear living in Applicant\u2019s marital home in the United States. At that time, she was a \nChinese citizen and resident. After his 2008 marriage, Applicant provided his then mother-\nin-law $330 per month of financial support. Applicant\u2019s former father-in-law is a Chinese \ncitizen and resident. Applicant last saw him in 2009 when Applicant traveled to China to \nbring his second wife to the United States after she received her U.S. visa. In his SOR \nresponse, he wrote that he stopped the payments to his second wife\u2019s mother \u201cyears \nago,\u201d which was presumably after his 2016 SCA, where he reported the support \npayments. He also represents that his wife\u2019s mother \u201chas no current husband\u201d and that \nshe has become a legal U.S. resident. (FORM Item 7 at 8-9; FORM Item 6 at 4, 5; FORM \nItem 3 at 1.)  \nIn 2011, the sister of Applicant\u2019s second wife, who was a Chinese citizen and \nresident at that time, entered the United States with her two children and spent time living \nin Applicant\u2019s marital home. In 2016, the sister-in-law married Applicant\u2019s son from his \nfirst marriage. Despite Applicant\u2019s divorce, the former sister-in-law remains Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter-in-law and the former mother-in-law remains his son\u2019s mother-in-law. The two \nchildren of Applicant\u2019s former sister-in-law\u2019s are now his son\u2019s stepchildren. (FORM Item \n7 at 8-9; FORM Item 6 at 4, 5.) \nIn an April 2017 follow-up background interview, Applicant disclosed that a week \nearlier he had met a Chinese woman over a Chinese-based online chat program. She is \na Chinese citizen, and she resided in China at that time. He met this woman online after \nanother person suggested online that he chat with her. Applicant did not identify the \nperson who introduced them. He told the interviewer that if his divorce was finalized, he \nwas interested in having a relationship with this Chinese woman. He told the interviewer \nthat he does not know anything about her employment or relationship to the Chinese \ngovernment, military, or intelligence service. (FORM Item 6 at 9.) \nIn November 2017, after his divorce from his second wife was official, Applicant \ntraveled to China to meet his new romantic interest. Upon his return a week later, he \nreported to his security official in an email that he intended to marry her. Applicant\u2019s \nremarriage occurred after his 2016 SCA and his January and April 2017 background \ninterviews. The date of their marriage does not appear in the record evidence. As a result, \nthe DOD CAF adjudicators were unaware of Applicant\u2019s marriage to a second Chinese \ncitizen and resident. Applicant\u2019s remarriage to a Chinese citizen and resident is not \nalleged in the SOR. In her FORM, Department Counsel declined to amend the SOR, \nalthough she noted that Applicant\u2019s marriage to another Chinese citizen is relevant to the \nissue of mitigation and the facts set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.c about his efforts to seek out \nrelationships with Chinese citizens. (FORM Response at 2-8; FORM at 5.) \n\n   4 \nApplicant\u2019s third wife is 48 years old and has a 20-year-old child, who is a student \nin a Chinese technological institute. Applicant pays her school expenses. His new wife \npresently lives with him at his job location in Africa while he sponsors her to become a \nU.S. resident alien. Before they married, his wife was a general manager of an insurance \ncompany in China. Everything the U.S. Government knows about this woman is limited \nto some details in his FORM response. (FORM Item 6 at 9; FORM response at 2, 4, 9, \n10-13, 22, 26-27; FORM Item 3 at 1.)\nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c that he \nregularly uses a Chinese online chat program to meet and communicate with Chinese \ncitizens. In his April 2017 background interview, he reported contact with the woman who \nwould become his third wife and three other women. Women in China would contact him \nusing a search function in the chat program. The contacts with these women were \ntypically of a limited duration. In his SOR response, he wrote that he now uses a different \nChinese chat system, which he uses to stay in contact with his new wife and her adult \nchild, his second wife and their two children, and his second wife\u2019s mother, sister and the \nsister\u2019s two children. He claims he only talks to his second wife and her mother if he is \ncontacting his two children with his ex-wife. (FORM Item 6 at 6; FORM Item 3 at 1; FORM \nresponse at 9, 27.) \nApplicant submitted a number of character reference letters. The references praise \nApplicant as dedicated and trustworthy. In his FORM response, he wrote that neither his \ncurrent wife nor his second wife have any affiliation with the Chinese government, but \nthat he was aware that either of them could be exploited by the Chinese government. He \nwrote further that if he ever faced that \u201chypothetical scenario,\u201d he would report it to his \nsecurity officials and remove himself from his overseas project. He writes further that he \nhas always reported his travel to China and that he has always followed the rules and \nintends to do so in the future. (FORM Response at 22-26.) \nApplicant\u2019s U.S. connections and contacts are largely limited to real estate \ninvestments he owns in this country and his immediate family, which includes his father, \ntwo brothers and a sister, and his three children from his first marriage, all of whom are \nU.S. citizens and residents. The record is silent on the nature of his relationships with \nthese family members. He also has some relationships with other U.S. contractors with \nwhom he has worked overseas since 2004, though he rarely stays in contact with other \ncontractors unless they happen to work on the same overseas project again. Applicant \nhas limited connections with other Americans. He describes himself as a \u201chomebody\u201d and \nis \u201cnot social.\u201d (FORM Item 6 at 5; FORM Item 7 at 12.) \nChina \nAdministrative or official notice was taken of certain facts concerning China as \nset forth in Department Counsel\u2019s rather extensive written request (FORM Item 8). The \nmost pertinent of those facts are the following: (1) China is an authoritarian state in which \n\n   5 \nthe Chinese Communist Party is the paramount authority; (2) China is actively engaged \nin intelligence gathering (industrial and military) that targets U.S. information and \ntechnology; (3) China\u2019s intelligence services, as well as private companies and other \nentities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China, \nwho can use their insider access to steal secrets; (4) the intelligence services also \nroutinely monitor communications, including telephone conversations, facsimile \ntransmissions, e-mail, text messaging, and Internet communications; and (5) China has \na poor record of human rights regarding respect for the integrity of the person (e.g., \nfreedom from arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life, disappearance, torture, and \narbitrary arrest or detention), respect for civil liberties, respect for political rights, \ncorruption, lack of transparency in government, worker rights, as well as discrimination, \nsocietal abuses, and trafficking in persons. The maltreatment and oppression of the \npeople of Tibet is but one example of China\u2019s poor record of human rights. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant\n\n   6 \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant was put on notice in 2007 that his relationship with a Chinese national \nwas an unacceptable security risk. Nevertheless, he married his very young Chinese \n\n   7 \ngirlfriend in 2008 brought her to the United States in 2009. She was closely followed by \nher mother, sister, and her sister\u2019s two children joining them in Applicant\u2019s marital home. \nWhen he was divorced by his Chinese wife in 2017, he married another Chinese citizen, \nwho he met online on a Chinese chat program. His admissions in his SOR response and \nFORM response and the documentary evidence in the record, taken as a whole, establish \nthe following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and, \nAG \u00b6 8(e): sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant has not established mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a). The nature of his \nrelationships with his second wife, her mother, and her sister, as alleged in the SOR, is \n\n   8 \nongoing despite his divorce from his second wife because they share two children. He \nmaintains a direct relationship with her as well as an indirect relationship with her through \ntheir two children. He also maintains a relationship with the sister of his second wife \nthrough his son\u2019s marriage to her and the son\u2019s stepchildren. Moreover, he has entered \ninto a new relationship with a woman he met through a Chinese website and subsequently \nmarried, which was one of the security concerns raised in the SOR. In light of the facts \nadministratively noticed regarding China\u2019s intelligence operations and its human rights \nviolations of its own citizens, Applicant has not established that it is unlikely Applicant will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States. \nSimilarly, mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b) has not been established. The record \nevidence demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s sense of obligation to his second wife, her sister, \nand mother is not minimal. Also, Applicant\u2019s choice, even before his divorce was finalized, \nto search for a new wife in China using a Chinese online chat program undercuts his \nevidence in mitigation. Furthermore, Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence of his \nties and loyalties in the United States, especially since he has not lived in the United \nStates for much of the past 15 years. He has provided no evidence about the strength of \nhis ties to his American family, specifically, his father, brothers, sister, and three children \nfrom his first marriage. Applicant states that he would resolve any conflicts of interest in \nfavor of the United States, but it cannot be concluded that \u201cthere is no conflict of interest\u201d \nbecause of his deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United States. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is established with respect to the father of Applicant\u2019s second wife. The \nrecord does not support the same conclusion with respect to his second wife, her mother, \nher sister, and her sister\u2019s children. Applicant has provided insufficient evidence about his \ncurrent relationship with his wife and her family to show that he has become sufficiently \ndistant or estranged from these women and related family members so as to create little \nlikelihood that those contacts could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s stepchild, an adult with whom he communicates, is a Chinese \ncitizen and resident studying technology at a university in China. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: (1) \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \n\n   9 \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating evidence in the record, I have given \nconsideration to Applicant\u2019s maturity and history of serving the United States working \noverseas for most of the last 15 years. This work has come with considerable personal \nsacrifices by Applicant. I have also considered his history of having lived in the United \nStates for the first 45 years of his life and having married a U.S.-born woman and raised \na family with her. I have weighed, however, Applicant\u2019s ties to the United States in light \nof having been warned in 2007 that his relationship with a Chinese national while working \nin that country with a security clearance presented a security risk that the U.S. \nGovernment was unwilling to accept. Nevertheless, Applicant proceeded to marry this \nwoman shortly after the conclusion of his work in China. With the knowledge of the \nGovernment\u2019s unwillingness to accept the security risk of Applicant having a relationship \nwith a Chinese national, he married another Chinese national after his divorce from his \nsecond wife and maintains a close relationship with his third wife and her child, a student \nin a Chinese technological institute. Applicant\u2019s use of a Chinese online chat program in \nthe past to meet women, including one who would become his third wife, shows a serious \nlack of concern for security, since his actions could readily be monitored by the Chinese \nsecurity services. He continues to use a different Chinese online chat program to maintain \ncontact with his present and former Chinese relatives. This pattern of careless or even \nreckless behavior over the last 11-12 years undermines Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation \nand raises serious questions about his judgment and trustworthiness. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his multiple contacts and connections \nwith Chinese citizens. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n\n   10 \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is \nrevoked. \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations and personal \nconduct trustworthiness concerns. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is \ndenied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The action was taken under \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 12, 2018, and elected to have \nher case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant \nreceived it on October 23, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as \n03/04/2019\n\n \n2 \nItems 1 through 6. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt \nof the FORM. She did not provide a response, submit documents, or object to \nany of the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 11, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except those in \u00b6\u00b6 1.x and \n2.a, which she denied. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings \nof fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. She married in 1999 and divorced in 2009. She \nhas a 17-year-old child from the marriage. Her ex-husband pays court-ordered \nchild support. She remarried in 2010. She has a 12-year-old stepchild. She has \nbeen employed by a government contractor since March 2011.1  \n \n \nIn July 2017, Applicant completed an electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). Section 26 inquired if in the past seven years \nApplicant had any property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or foreclosed; \ndefaulted on any type of loan; had any bills or debts turned over to a collection \nagency; had a credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay \nany as agreed; was evicted for nonpayment; had wages, benefits, or assets \ngarnished or attached for any reason; had been over 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt not previously entered; or was currently over 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt? Applicant responded \u201cno.\u201d2 \n \n \n \nIn February 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator. She was confronted with each of the debts subsequently alleged in \nthe SOR, except those in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.q. She acknowledged each debt \nand explained she failed to disclose each one due to oversight. She did not know \nthe amount of each debt or when each debt became delinquent. She said the \nreason for the delinquencies was because she did not have enough money due \nto her husband\u2019s unemployment. She told the investigator that she intended to \npay each debt. She gave the investigator a time period for when each debt would \nbe paid. It ranged from one week and up to five years. She also indicated she did \nnot know when she would satisfy one of the debts.3  \n \n \nApplicant told the investigator that she paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.x owed to \nan apartment complex for a broken lease from 2011. She provided a document \nto the investigator, but it did not confirm the debt was paid. The investigator told \n                                                          \n1 Items 3, 4. \n \n2 Item 3. \n \n3 Items 3, 4. \n\n \n3 \nher that she could provide additional information to show it was paid. None was \nprovided.4 This debt is not resolved.  \n \n \nApplicant told the investigator that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was for a car \nrepossession from 2004. She said she had reached a settlement agreement with \nthe creditor that required her to make monthly payments for six months. The \ninvestigator gave her an opportunity to provide documents after the interview to \nsubstantiate the settlement. She did not provide documents to the investigator or \nin her SOR answer.5  \n \n \nApplicant told the investigator that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was for a broken \nrental agreement from an apartment she lived in from June 2011 to July 2013. \nShe intended to settle the debt with monthly payments for six months. She did \nnot provide supporting documentation.6  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR regarding her failure to disclose any \ndelinquent debts on her e-QIP, she stated:  \n \n \nThis information was entered in as an error due to multiple \ncorrections being made to my e-QIP. I would never do anything that \nwould falsify my facts. The mistake was made after the attempt to \nmake several correct[ions] to my e-QIP.7  \n \n \nApplicant subsequently provided an additional statement where she \nadmitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, but stated: \n \nThis information was entered in as an error due to corrections being \nmade to my E-QIP. I would never intently falsify any information. \nOnce again this mistake was made after correcting information \n(providing my address from 10 years ago) to my E-QIP.8. \n \n \nApplicant did not voluntarily disclose her delinquent debts when she was \ninterviewed by the government investigator. She told the investigator that her \nfailure to disclose each delinquent debt when confronted was due to an \noversight. There is no evidence supporting her assertions that she told the \ninvestigator she had previously disclosed her delinquent debts on her e-QIP or \nthat there was a problem when she tried to correct other mistakes. I do not find \nApplicant\u2019s statements credible. I find she intentionally failed to disclose \ndelinquent debts on her e-QIP.  \n                                                          \n4 Items 3, 4. \n \n5 Item 4. \n \n6 Item 4. \n \n7 Item 2. \n \n8 Item 2.  \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are corroborated by her admissions and \ncredit reports from August 2017 and May 2018. Applicant did not provide \nevidence about when her husband lost his job; how long he was unemployed; \nher income; whether she has a budget; any proof that she paid any of the debts; \nor documents to substantiate that she paid a debt she disputed, or settlement \nagreements she indicated she had entered.9  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, next to each debt (except \u00b6 1.x), she \nadmitted owing that debt and said that she had hired a credit repair company. \nShe provided a letter from the company from September 2018, stating that it had \nbeen retained by Applicant to remove several fraudulent and/or inaccurate \naccounts from her credit file. It stated that its fraud department was investigating \nher accounts. Applicant acknowledged to the credit repair company that any \naccounts that she is financially responsible for will be negotiated and paid.10 \nApplicant did not provide any statements, explanations, or other evidence that \nany of the alleged accounts, which she admitted owing, were due to fraud or \nwere inaccurate. There is no evidence Applicant has received financial \ncounseling from this company or other entity.11 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, \nthe administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in determining an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a position of trust. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n                                                          \n9 Items 2, 3, 4. \n \n10 Item 2. \n \n11 Item 2.  \n\n \n5 \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, states that the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty \nhours. The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in \nindividuals to whom it grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, \nrisk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial \nconsiderations is set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial \ndistress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a \npossible indicator of, other issues of personnel security concern \nsuch as excessive gambling mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in \nillegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence \nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might \nknowingly compromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting sensitive information. An individual who is \nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in \nhandling and safeguarding sensitive information.12 \n                                                          \n12 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App.Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n6 \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nThe following are potentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in \nabout 2004, which she has been unable to pay or resolve. There is sufficient \nevidence to establish the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or \nidentity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a \nnon-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documentary proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute \nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that she has paid or resolved any of \nher delinquent debts. Her debts are recent and ongoing. She has not established \na reliable financial track record. There is insufficient evidence to conclude future \nfinancial problem are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to the loss of income due to her \nhusband\u2019s unemployment. This was beyond her control. For the full application of \n\n \n7 \nAG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. She \ndid not provide details as to when her husband lost his job; how long he was \nunemployed or if he is still unemployed. She told the government investigator \nthat she had payment agreements with some creditors. She also said she would \npay some debts within a week and other debts within future time periods. She did \nnot provide proof that she paid any of the creditors. The evidence is insufficient to \nshow she has acted responsibly regarding her delinquent debts since they began \naccumulating. AG \u00b6 20(b) only partially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that she has participated in credit or \nfinancial counseling or has a budget to show responsible financial management. \nAlthough she recently hired a credit repair company, there is insufficient evidence \nto conclude that there are clear indications that her financial problems are being \nresolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \n  \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve \nany of her debts. She disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.x, but did not provide \nevidence to substantiate her dispute and actions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(e) do not \napply.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is \nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the \nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with \nthe security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern \nand may be disqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities. \n \nApplicant has had financial issues since at least 2004 when her car was \nrepossessed. She accumulated numerous delinquent debts since then. She did \nnot disclose any of the delinquencies on her e-QIP. She did not voluntarily \ndisclose them when she was interviewed by a government investigator. When \nconfronted with each delinquent debt, she told the investigator that her omissions \n\n \n8 \nwere due to oversight. She did not mention to the investigator that she had \npreviously disclosed them on an earlier version of her e-QIP, but after editing the \ne-QIP the debts were not saved or entered. I did not find her explanation \ncredible. I find Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her delinquent debts. The \nabove disqualifying condition applies. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered the following \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant made a prompt good-faith \neffort to correct the omissions and disclose her financial problems before being \nconfronted by the government investigator. She told the investigator that she \nfailed to disclose each of her delinquent debts was due to oversight. Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to provide answers on her e-QIP truthfully is not minor. The Government \nrelies on those seeking positions of trust to honestly disclose information, which \nmay sometimes be derogatory. Failure to do so raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and \n17(c) do not apply.  \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or \nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment.  \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. She has a history, beginning in 2004, of financial \nproblems. She deliberately failed to disclose these issues on her e-QIP. She told \nthe government investigator that she had settlement agreements with some of \nher creditors, but failed to produce documentary evidence to substantiate her \nstatements. She recently hired a credit repair company to dispute fraudulent or \ninaccurate debts, but this action does not mitigate her failure to address or \nresolve the numerous delinquent debts she admitted she owed. She failed to \nprovide information about her current finances or the period of time her husband \nwas unemployed. Applicant has not established a sufficient reliable financial \ntrack record. There is insufficient evidence to overcome the trustworthiness \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.x: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility \nfor access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 23, \n2017, seeking clearance eligibility required for his position with a federal contractor. \nAfter reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 19, \n2018, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on November 13, 2018, and initially requested a decision based on \nthe administrative record, without a hearing. On a later date, Applicant requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on February 28, 2019, and issued a notice of \nhearing on April 3, 2019, setting the hearing for April 30, 2019. At the hearing, the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment offered five exhibits (GE 2 through 6). GE 1 is the discovery letter that was \nmarked for the record, but it is not evidence. Applicant testified and submitted ten \nexhibits (AE 1 through 12). AE 11 and 12 were received post-hearing. All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 13, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 16 charged-off, in-collection, or delinquent \naccounts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.p) totaling about $36,000; that he failed to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017 (\u00b6 1.q); and that he owes $6,295 in \npast-due federal taxes for tax year 2015 (\u00b6 1.r), and $2,492 for tax year 2017 (\u00b6 1.s). \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n, and admitted all of the remaining allegations. \nHis SOR admissions, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is a 2002 high \nschool graduate, and he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 2002, where he served \nhonorably until his discharge as an E-4 in November 2010. He believes that he \npossessed a clearance during his service, but is not sure. Applicant married in 2003 and \ndivorced in 2014. He has four children, ages 19, 18, 7, and 2. Applicant attended \ncollege between 2007 and 2010, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. His student loans \nwere in forbearance as of April 2018. (GE 3)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history (2017 SCA) indicates that after his discharge from the \nservice he worked part-time between November 2010 and March 2013; was employed \nas a transportation driver between March 2013 and October 2016; and was hired by the \nfederal contractor currently sponsoring his clearance in October 2016. His interim \nclearance was withdrawn pending the adjudication of the financial concerns in the SOR, \nand he was laid off. Thereafter, he has been working for different companies for less \nincome.  \n \nIn his response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2017 SCA, Applicant \ndenied having financial problems and responded \u201cNO\u201d to questions asking whether he \nhad any delinquent, in-collection, or charged-off accounts. He also failed to disclose that \nhe did not timely file his federal income tax return for tax years 2016 and 2017 and that \nhe owe federal taxes for tax years 2015 and 2017.  \n \nApplicant timely filed his federal income tax returns for tax year 2015. He \nrequested an extension to file his tax year 2016 federal income tax return, but failed to \nfile it on time. He filed his 2016 and 2017 federal and state income tax returns in August \n1, 2018, and was assessed penalties and interest for not pre-paying his taxes and for \nfiling late. (AE 4, GE 4, AE 7) Applicant received a $2,991 refund for tax year 2018 that \nwas applied to taxes owed for tax year 2015.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nConcerning the SOR accounts that he denied, Applicant is disputing SOR \u00b6 1.k \nbecause he believes this is a credit card opened by his ex-wife in his name, but without \nhis consent. In his April 2018 interview, Applicant claimed that the creditor promised not \nto hold him responsible for the delinquent account if he submitted documentary \nevidence of his divorce. Applicant presented no documentary evidence at the hearing to \nshow he disputed this account through the credit bureaus or with the creditor; that he \nwas released from responsibility by the creditor; or that the account belonged to his \nwife. \n \nApplicant is disputing SOR \u00b6 1.l because he believes that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) was required to pay for his college tuition under the GI Bill \neducation benefits program. However, Applicant failed to complete the semester. Thus, \nthe VA will not likely pay for this tuition expense. Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.n, and \ninitially stated he disputed it. However, at his hearing he admitted that this was his \naccount and it is delinquent. (Tr. 46)  \n \nApplicant retained the services of a debt relief company seeking help to pay off \nhis debts on November 8, 2018. He stated his intention to pay off his delinquent debts \nthrough this program. He testified that all of the SOR accounts were included in the debt \nrelief program, except for his tax debts. However, only the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.m were enrolled in the program. Applicant apparently made \ntwo payments into the program and stopped. He presented no documentary evidence to \nshow how much and how frequently he has been contributing into the program, and \nwhether any accounts have been paid through it. Applicant presented little documentary \nevidence to show that he has many any payments, established payment arrangements, \ndisputed any accounts, or otherwise resolved any of the accounts alleged in the SOR. \n(Tr. 42) He documented a one-time payment to the debt alleged in SOR 1.h. \n \nApplicant is not interested in addressing his delinquent accounts promptly. He \nbelieves that the longer he waits to address them the better settlement offers he will \nreceive from his creditors. (Tr. 43) His seven delinquent medical accounts resulted from \nperiods of unemployment or when he did not have insurance.  \n \nConcerning his delinquent taxes, Applicant explained that in 2015 he was \nworking as an independent contractor for the first time and he did not understand his tax \nresponsibilities. He failed to pay estimated taxes, and when he filed for tax year 2015, \nhe realized he did not have the documents he needed. As a result, he was assessed a \nlarge tax liability. The problem was aggravated when he failed to timely file his income \ntax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017 because he was afraid of his possible tax \nliability. \n \nApplicant entered into a payment agreement with the IRS to pay his delinquent \ntaxes for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 on November 8, 2018. He agreed to pay $112 \non the first of each month. He submitted documentary evidence showing he made two \npayments. Applicant testified that he had to stop making the payments because his \nearnings were insufficient to pay for his debts and living expenses. He claimed he told \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe IRS to suspend the payment agreement until he was making more money. (Tr. 50-\n51) \n \nApplicant noted that he has made substantial progress paying his delinquent \ntaxes. The IRS has been applying his refunds to his tax debt. He owed $3,686 for tax \nyear 2015. In 2016, he received a $1,255 refund that was applied to his debt. In 2017, \nhe was assessed a tax liability of $2,575. In 2018, he received a refund of $2,991 that \nalso was applied to his debt. As of his hearing date, Applicant owed federal taxes in the \namount of $2,215 for tax years 2015 and 2017. (AE 9) Applicant believes that if he had \ntimely filed his income tax returns he would not have had any problems, but since \u201c[he] \nlet it go so far it became a problem.\u201d  \n \nApplicant explained that when he was discharged in 2010, he was working, going \nto school, and had his own security business. Then his wife had a baby, they divorced \nin 2014, and within a year everything went haywire. His ex-wife went her own separate \nway and money was just pouring out of his pockets. During that time, he was only \nthinking about his survival, paying child support, helping out his ex-wife, while at the \nsame time trying to keep a roof over his head, and his financial situation became \nunbearable. (Tr. 47) \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for not filing his income tax returns on time. He \nclaimed that he has learned a hard lesson and promised to timely file his income tax \nreturns and to pay his taxes in the future.  \n \nAt hearing, Applicant stated: \u201cI have been in this process for my security \nclearance for over two years and it really made me take a look at how I\u2019m handling my \nfinances. These are my problems and they are something that I have to fix.\u201d He believes \nthat he is doing the best he can do in his current circumstances. He noted that he has \nnot been consistently employed since he was in the service. He is concerned about not \ngetting his clearance and losing his job.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. He has 16 \naccounts delinquent, in collection, or charged off: seven of the accounts are for \ndelinquent medical services from periods when he had no medical insurance, two are \nfor repossessed vehicles, three are for utilities, and one is for tuition fees. He failed to \ntimely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017, and he owes \n$2,215 in taxes for tax years 2015 and 2017. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions \nthat raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record established the \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions.  \n \nSix mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013), the Appeal Board \nconcisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that none of the mitigating conditions \nare sufficiently raised by the evidence and are not applicable. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are frequent, recent, and ongoing. \nAdditionally, he failed to timely file his 2016 and 2017 income tax returns and owes \npast-due taxes for tax years 2015 and 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant established circumstances beyond his control that may have \ncontributed to or aggravated his financial situation, such as his discharge from the \nservice in 2010, periods of unemployment or underemployment, and his 2014 divorce. \nNotwithstanding, I find that Applicant failed to establish that he was financially \nresponsible under the circumstances. He presented little evidence of reasonable efforts \nto pay, settle, dispute, or otherwise resolve his delinquent accounts until after he was \nserved with the SOR in October 2018.  \n \n \nI give Applicant credit for filing his 2016 and 2017 income tax returns in August \n2018, and for establishing a payment arrangement with the IRS in November 2018. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant failed to comply with the terms of his payment arrangement \nwith the IRS and only made two payments. I also give Applicant credit for hiring a debt \nrelief company to help him pay, settle, and resolve his delinquent accounts in November \n8, 2018. However, Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence is insufficient to show that he \ncontinued making contributions to the debt relief company program, or that any of his \naccounts were paid, settled, or resolved. Applicant presented little evidence of any \npayments made, payment arrangements established, disputes filed, or resolution of any \nof the accounts alleged in the SOR, except as indicated above. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare not under control. He failed to establish a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, and \nto establish a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the two disputed debts. \nAdditionally, Applicant neglected his legal obligation to timely file his income tax returns \nover two years. \u201cFailure to comply with federal and state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding to well-established Government rules and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nregulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for protecting \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). This is \ntrue even if the returns have been filed. See, ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 27, 2016).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his federal income tax returns in a timely manner, and \nhis failure to pay his debts does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information. See, ISCR Case \nNo. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). Applicant failed to demonstrate financial \nresponsibility. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 36, has about 10 years of active service in the Navy and working for \nfederal contractors. He apparently held a clearance while in the service. He failed to \ndemonstrate good judgment and reliability. His failure to timely file his tax returns and to \npay his debts shows that he has a problem complying with well-established rules. At this \ntime, his evidence is insufficient to establish a track record of financial responsibility. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.s:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a decision without\n2\nhearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The record in this case\nclosed 8 February 2019, when Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due. Applicant\nprovided no additional documents.

He is a 43-\nyear-old project manager employed by a U.S. defense contractor since February 2015.\nHe served honorably in the U.S. military from March 1995 to March 2015, when he\nretired. He was recently divorced from his second wife (June 2018). They had two\nchildren together before separating in April 2016. He seeks to retain the clearance\nwhich was most recently renewed in February 2006 (GE 2).\nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits (Items 2-7) substantiate, and Applicant\nadmits 11 delinquent debts totaling over $66,000 (SOR 1.b-1.k and 1.m). Applicant\ndenies SOR 1.l, which is established by Item 6. Applicant also admits having his house\nforeclosed upon in November 2016 (SOR 1.a), filling for Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nprotection in October 2015 (SOR 1.n), and having a state tax lien in March 2015 (SOR\n1.o).3\nApplicant reported filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on his November\n2015 clearance application (Item 2). The October 2015 filing, listed $106,000 in\ndelinquent debt, and encompassed most of the SOR debts. Applicant discussed the\nSOR debts during his October 2016 interview with a Government investigator (Item 3),\nbased on his November 2015 credit report (Item 4). The Chapter 13 petition had been\ndismissed for non-payment in April 2016, when he and his wife separated.\nApplicant\u2019s December 2018 Answer (Item 1) enclosed copies of the final divorce\ndecree and supporting documents, and some records from a consumer credit\ncounseling organization. It also contained a September 2018 letter from Applicant\u2019s\nbankruptcy lawyer to Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s divorce lawyer, proposing that Applicant and\nhis ex-wife jointly file separate bankruptcy petitions to resolve their marital debt. The\ndivorce decree specifies that Applicant is responsible for most of the marital debt, and\nhis credit reports (Items 4-6) indicate that most of the debts are his individual accounts.\nThe record contains no indication whether or what response was received to Applicant\u2019s\noffer, which included Applicant paying for his ex-wife\u2019s bankruptcy-filing expenses.\nApplicant attributed their financial problems to his then-wife losing her teaching\njob in 2011, and remaining unemployed until August 2015. They used their credit cards\nto pay their ongoing living expenses. Yet, there is no evidence of any efforts undertaken\nby her to regain employment or cut their living expenses during that time. When she\nbecame re-employed, they tried Chapter 13 bankruptcy but that effort was overtaken,\nand their finances further complicated, by their April 2016 separation. \nApplicant presumably received the credit counseling required as a precondition\nfor filing his bankruptcy petition in 2015.

A Chapter 7\ndischarge would give him a fresh start. A Chapter 13 plan would require a\ndemonstration of sufficient income to manage the plan payments. Finally, he provided\nno work or character references, or any evidence of community involvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties which date back to at least 2011. The financial problems were due to\nApplicant\u2019s wife losing her job in 2011 and were compounded by their separation in\n2016. Nevertheless, Applicant has not explained his relative inaction on his finances\nsince his October 2016 interview with the Government investigator.5\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history\n5\nof not meeting financial obligations;\n3\n\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. \nHis financial difficulties are both recent and multiple, although his financial situation may \nbe considered unlikely to recur.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due to\n6\ncircumstances beyond his control; but it is debatable whether he dealt responsibly with\nhis delinquent debts.  Applicant documented no efforts between 2011, when his wife\n7\nlost her job, to October 2015 when he first attempted bankruptcy, for his wife to find new\nemployment, or for them to try to reduce their living expenses. Moreover, bankruptcy\ncan be a legitimate and responsible means of addressing debt, but Applicant\u2019s case\nwould be much stronger if his plans for a future bankruptcy had progressed beyond the\ndiscussion stage with his ex-wife.\nApplicant presumably received credit counseling as part of his unsuccessful 2015\nbankruptcy petition, and is likely to receive it again if he files or has filed for bankruptcy\nprotection after his final decree, as contemplated. Yet now, his delinquent debts remain\nin limbo. Thus, it is too soon to conclude that this debt was being resolved or under\ncontrol.  Similarly, it is too soon to establish that he has made a good-faith effort to\n8\naddress this debt.  Moreover, he provided no \u201cwhole person\u201d evidence upon which I\n9\nmight base a favorable result. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline F against Applicant.\n Formal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-n:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph o:\nFor Applicant\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . . and there are clear\n8\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n9\nresolve debts.\n4\n\nConclusion\nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n06/13/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nJ, criminal conduct and Guideline D, sexual behavior. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 15, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J, criminal \nconduct and Guideline D, sexual behavior. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 2, 2018, and requested an \nadministrative determination. Pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.7 of enclosure 3 of the Directive, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel converted this case to a hearing case. (Hearing exhibit (HE I)) As \nsuch, the case was assigned to me on February 27, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 15, 2019, and the \nhearing was held as scheduled on May 21, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) \n1 through 8, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s \ndiscovery letter to Applicant was marked as HE II and the Government\u2019s exhibit list was \nmarked as HE III. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A through E, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJune 5, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer, he admitted both allegations in the SOR, with \nexplanations. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. He married in 1989 and divorced in 1998. He has two \nadult children and a stepchild from this marriage. He remarried in 2000 and divorced in \n2013. He has a 16-year-old daughter from this marriage. He is seeking an information \ntechnology (IT) position with the defense contractor for whom he worked before his \nfelony conviction. He is a high school graduate who has taken some college courses. \n(Tr. 4-5, 26, 29; GE 1, 6)   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant was convicted of possession of child pornography, a \nfelony, in August 2012. He was sentenced to 5-10 years of confinement (suspended) \nand placed on supervised probation for 10 years. He is required to register as a sex \noffender (SOR \u00b6 1.a). This conduct, including electronically searching, downloading, \nand viewing numerous still pictures and at least one video containing child pornography \nbetween 2010 and April 2011, was cross-alleged as sexual behavior under Guideline D \nin the SOR. (SOR \u00b6 2.a). His admissions in his investigative interview, his Answer, and \nat his hearing, along with court documents, establish the allegations by substantial \nevidence. (Tr. 26-27; GE 2-5) \n \n \n \nIn March 2011, the state\u2019s Internet Crimes Against Children task force (ACAC) \nexecuted a search warrant on Applicant\u2019s home based upon information that he \npossessed child pornography. Applicant\u2019s computers and hard drives were seized. \nBased upon the evidence derived from the search, Applicant was charged with \npossession of child pornography. In December 2012, he pleaded guilty to felony \npossession of child pornography. His sentence included: 5-10 years confinement \n(suspended); 10 years of supervised probation; requirement to register as a sex \noffender; and completion of a sex offender class. His probation is scheduled to end in \n2022. (GE 2, 6) \n \n \nApplicant admitted to a defense investigator and a forensic psychologist (who \nexamined him at times from June 2011 to September 2011, before his guilty plea at the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nrequest of Applicant\u2019s attorney) that he has had an addiction to pornography (adult) \nsince he was a teenager. He acknowledged that he knowingly downloaded the specific \nchild pornography to which he pleaded guilty, but he claims that he just \u201cgrabbed large \nchucks of files\u201d on the Internet. He claimed to the psychologist that his only sexual \ninterest is in fully adult females. He also admitted to the psychologist that he was \nfamiliar with some child specific search terms. The psychologist noted that based upon \nhis evaluation, Applicant\u2019s risk of using child pornography in the future is low, however, \nhe further indicated that Applicant\u2019s lack of a good marital relationship along with his \ncontinued use of \u201cregular\u201d pornography creates the most high-risk circumstance for him \nto reoffend. (GE 2, 6) \n \n \nAs stated above, Applicant is currently on probation and will remain so until 2022. \nUnder the terms of his probation, he is prohibited from possessing or viewing any sort of \npornography, from any type of media, including computers. A violation of his probation \ncould subject him to revocation of its terms and imposition of his original sentence to \nconfinement. During his testimony, when asked if he was in compliance with his \nprobation terms he responded, \u201cI have kept the requirements of my probation.\u201d This was \na false statement because he later admitted under questioning by Department Counsel \nand myself that he has been viewing pornography as frequently as monthly, almost the \nentire time he has been on probation\u2014seven years. He has not disclosed his \npornography viewing to his probation officer. He claims he is receiving counseling from \nhis church for this problem, but presented no documentation to support that claim. He \ndocumented completing court-ordered counseling in December 2015, with a letter from \nhis counselor. It acknowledged that he attended all sessions and was an active \nparticipant. (Tr. 30-35, 37-38; GE 5) \n \n \n \nApplicant presented five reference letters from a colleague, his ex-wife, a friend, \nhis current supervisor, and his former facilities security officer (FSO). Applicant is \ndescribed as accurate, professional, a good father, dedicated, loyal, knowledgeable with \ncomputers, honest, having great integrity, a great asset to his employer, and trustworthy \nin the work place. A friend and his former FSO recommend him for a security clearance. \n(AE A-E) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\n \n4 \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted; and  \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \nApplicant was convicted of possession of child pornography, a felony, and was \nsentenced, inter alia, to 10 years\u2019 probation, which runs until 2022. I find that both \ndisqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s possession of child pornography conviction occurred in 2012. \nAlthough he is several years removed from that conviction he remains on probation until \n2022. In that regard, he has consistently violated the terms of his probation by \ncontinuing to view pornography (adult). His actions cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His rehabilitative efforts have not been successful \ngiven his continuing probation violations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply.   \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of possession of child pornography, a felony. The above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for sexual behavior under \nAG \u00b6 14 and considered the following potentially relevant:   \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b) does not fully apply as explained above under the criminal conduct \nguideline. Applicant was seen by a psychologist before his guilty plea and he completed \ncourt-mandated counseling. Despite these strides, he has not overcome his compulsion \nto view adult pornography, which puts him at greater risk to reoffend with child \npornography. AG \u00b6 14(e) does not fully apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s letters of \nrecommendation, his psychological evaluation, his counseling, and his personal \ncircumstances. I weighed these factors against his conviction for possessing child \npornography and his continuing probation violations.   \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines J and D. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 22, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign \ninfluence) and E (personal conduct). Applicant responded to the SOR on October 13, \n2018, and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn January 21, 2019, Applicant changed his request to a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nFebruary 25, 2019, and reassigned to me on June 3, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled on June 26, 2019.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was \nadmitted without objection. \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Afghanistan. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not \nbe repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of \nterrorism and ongoing human rights problems in Afghanistan. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer as a linguist in Afghanistan since 2015. He previously worked for \nthe same employer or another defense contractor in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011, \n2012 to 2013, and 2013 to 2014. He attended college for a period, but he has not \nearned a degree. He is married with five children. \n \n \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan to Afghan parents. He worked under \ndangerous conditions in Afghanistan as a linguist for a defense contractor in support of \nthe U.S. military from 2006 through 2009. Because of his work, he was eligible for a \nspecial immigrant visa. He immigrated to the United States with his family in 2009. He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2015. His work as a linguist in support of the U.S. military since \n2010 has also been under dangerous conditions. \n \n \nFour of Applicant\u2019s children were born in Afghanistan; one was born in the United \nStates. His wife and all of his children are U.S. citizens. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. He was a farmer. His mother, two siblings, \nparents-in-law, and four siblings-in-law are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. He \nhas another brother-in-law who immigrated to the United States on a special immigrant \nvisa. Applicant\u2019s mother does not work outside the farm. Applicant has provided her \nfinancial support on an as-needed basis, predominantly for her cancer treatment. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a former judge. He is currently a farmer on the family\u2019s \nfarm. Applicant\u2019s sister and her husband are also farmers. Two of Applicant\u2019s brothers-\nin-law used to work as clerks at the Afghan agency involved in intelligence. Applicant \nbelieves his brothers-in-law left the agency before 2013, and that they are now \nshopkeepers. His father-in-law used to work as a clerk in the executive branch of the \nAfghanistan government. Applicant believes his father-in-law retired about ten years \nago.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has not returned to Afghanistan since she immigrated to the \nUnited States. She maintains telephonic contact with her family. Applicant will \nsometimes also speak with them. Applicant is prohibited from visiting his family in \n\n \n3 \n \nAfghanistan when he is there working. He has not seen his family in Afghanistan since \nhe immigrated to the United States in 2009. Applicant credibly testified that his family in \nAfghanistan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified \ninformation.  \n \n \nApplicant \ncompleted \nCounterintelligence-Focused \nSecurity \nScreening \nQuestionnaires in 2010, 2013, 2015, and 2017. He reported the information discussed \nabove about his relatives in Afghanistan, including specifically discussing his brother\u2019s \nand brothers-in-law\u2019s positions with the Afghanistan government.  \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nApril 2015. Under the relatives section (Section 18), he listed his foreign relatives, \nincluding his brother and father-in-law. He reported that his brother was a judge and that \nhis father-in-law worked in the executive branch of the Afghanistan government. The \nsection did not require him to report siblings-in-law. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to the foreign \ngovernment contact question under Section 20B. He thought that was the correct \nanswer as none of his relatives worked for the Afghanistan government when the SF 86 \nwas submitted. I find that he did not intentionally provide false information on the SF 86. \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nAfghanistan. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion, both directly and through his wife. The above disqualifying conditions have \nbeen raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable:  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Afghanistan. The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in \nAfghanistan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified \ninformation. The Appeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of \nlimited value, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar \nmanner in the past in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous \ntrack record of complying with security regulations and procedures in the context of \ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the \nnational security. See, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). In \nISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed \nthis issue as follows: \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist for the U.S. military in \nAfghanistan from 2006 to 2009, which earned him a special immigrant visa. He returned \nto work in Afghanistan as a linguist in 2010, and has spent much of the last nine years \nthere. I find that Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant did not list his family members who worked for \nthe Afghanistan government under Section 20B of the SF 86. He reported that his \nbrother was a judge and that his father-in-law worked in the executive branch of the \nAfghanistan government under a different section (Section 18) of the SF 86. He \n\n \n7 \n \nreported all his foreign relatives who worked for the Afghanistan government on \nprevious questionnaires. He thought that he answered Section 20B correctly because \nnone of his relatives worked for the Afghanistan government when the SF 86 was \nsubmitted. Applicant did not intentionally provide false information on his 2015 SF 86. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) has not been established. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Afghanistan earned him a special \nimmigrant visa. He returned to Afghanistan as a linguist in 2010, and he has spent \nmuch of the last nine years there. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s \nproven record of action in defense of the United States is very important and can lead to \na favorable result for an applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007). The complicated state of affairs in Afghanistan places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his foreign family \nmembers do not pose an unacceptable security risk. He has met that burden.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nthe personal conduct security concerns, and he mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 42-46; AE C, D, H. \n \n7 Tr. at 52-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE A, L, M. \n \n8 Tr. at 30-32, 60-61, 68-69. \n\n \n4 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe $570 defaulted student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a duplicate of one of the \ntwo defaulted student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h. When the same conduct is \n\n \n5 \n \nalleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations \nshould be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.f is concluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment wherein he was \nunable to find full-time work. Those conditions were beyond his control. \n \n \nThe student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($3,555) and 1.e ($1,397) were \nresolved through payments of $2,237 in March 2017; $2,138 in March 2018; and $815 \nin August 2018, which indicates that Applicant started addressing his financial problems \nmore than a year before the SOR was issued. He contracted with a credit-counseling \ncompany in about August 2018. He enrolled four debts in the company\u2019s DMP, including \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($4,810), 1.d ($288), and 1.e ($145). He is also paying \na $1,451 debt to his state for overpaid unemployment compensation through the DMP. \nHe completed the payment of the $288 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d outside the \nDMP. He is making payments toward the $8,464 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n  \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but a security clearance \nadjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to \nresolve the financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There \nis no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts \nsimultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid \nfirst. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nI believe Applicant is honest and sincere in his intentions to address all his debts. \nI find that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant action \nto implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made a \n\n \n6 \n \ngood-faith effort to pay his debts. It may take time, but I am convinced that he will \neventually resolve his financial problems.9 The above mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n9 See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay. 31, 2011): \u201cDepending on the facts of a given case, the fact that an applicant\u2019s debts will not be paid \noff for a long time, in and of itself, may be of limited security concern.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 1, 2018. \nOn August 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F and Guideline E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was \nassigned to me on March 7, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \n\n2 \n \nissued a notice of hearing on June 13, 2019, scheduling the hearing for August 29, 2019. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n \nI marked the Government\u2019s discovery letter as Hearing EX (HE) I. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection.  Applicant testified, \nand presented Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-E without objection. The record was kept open \nuntil September 30, 2019 for supplemental documentation. Applicant requested an \nadditional 30 days and the Government did not object. The record closed on October 30, \n2019. Applicant did not submit any evidence. However, on November 7, 2019, Applicant \nsubmitted a packet of documents, which was marked as AE F. The Government did not \nobject and the document is entered into the record. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nSeptember 9, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 1989 and attended college courses in chemistry, but he did not complete \nhis degree. (GE 1) Applicant has obtained various certifications throughout his career. \n(Tr. ) He is married and has two children. He has held a security clearance since 2005.  \nApplicant has been employed with his current employer for about a week. (Tr. 16). He \nhas  his own firm, which he began in 2008. He has been a contractor for the federal \ngovernment since 2005. (GE 1) \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a-1.h delinquent debts totaling approximately $175,000.  \nApplicant disputed the financial allegation listed in the SOR 1.a, and states the other \naccounts are settled or in payment plans. He noted that SOR 1.c is a duplicate account \nwith 1.h. Applicant denied the personal conduct allegation listed in the SOR at 2.a for \nfailure to disclose his debts on his SCA. (GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed for nine months in 2018. (Tr. 18) He noted in his 2016 \nSCA that until 2008, his financial situation was ideal. He went into debt caring for his \nparents, his in-laws and others, such as his sister, who needed help. (GE 1) His parents \ndied in the time period of 2009 to 2011. He incurred substantial medical bills.  Applicant \nalso stated when he was interviewed for his security clearance in 2017, he had received \nabout $50,000 from his father\u2019s life insurance policy and about $35,000 from a house sold \nin 2006. He stated that he paid larger loans and left the smaller ones unpaid. (GE 2)  \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.a, Applicant is disputing this account for $37,521 because he was a \nvictim of fraud. He explained that he had a bank loan for a vehicle which he signed to an \nout-of-state car dealership. He sent a bank check in the amount of $50,000 so that he \ncould obtain a luxury car. He never received the car nor his money. Applicant contacted \nthe fraud department of the bank. In 2016, the dealership sent $13,000 to the bank. (AE \nA) Applicant received advice to pursue action through an attorney to possibly recoup his \nmoney. This happenend in 2017. The bank is holding Applicant liable for the remainder \n\n3 \n \nof the loan. Applicant contacted the bank in August 2018, but he has not set up a payment \nplan because he believes the matter is still \u201cpending.\u201d (Tr. 60) He was emphatic that the \nbank has not asked him for any money, but it is showing on his credit report as \u201ccharged \noff.\u201d ( Tr. 58, GE 3) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.b, this is a charged-off amount of $6,852 owing to the same bank as \n1.a. Applicant presented a letter dated November 11, 2018, that stated a payment has \nresolved the debt and it is settled in full. (AE A, Tr. 32) \n \n \nAs to  SOR 1.c, it is a  charged-off account in the amount of $5,831, which was \nopened in 2006. This account is the result of a bank check  in the amount of $7,000 that \nApplicant  gave to his brother-in-law so that he could get a car.  He did not make the \npayments and Applicant realizes that he is liable for the amount. (Tr. 66) Applicant \nreceived a letter from the company and agreed to a payment plan of $165 a month in \nAugust 2018. (AE B) There is no evidence of any payments and he did not know the \ncurrent balance. Applicant states that this is the same account as in 1.h. He did not submit \nany receipts or payments for either account. In his post-hearing submission this account \nis listed on a 2019 creditor debt list in the amount of $4,595. (AE F) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.d, a charged-off account in the amount of $14,755, Applicant stated \nthat the account is settled. He also stated that this is the same account as listed in SOR \n1.f. He submitted a 2018 letter that showed the account was settled for $4,000 in 2018. \n(AE C) The 2016 credit report shows that the account was charged off in 2010. (GE 4) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.e, a charged-off account opened in 2008 in the amount of $7,663. \nApplicant explained that he used the loan money to help his family and others. (Tr. 84) \nHe produced no documentation of current payments on his plan. His credit report states \nthat the account was charged off in 2010. (GE 4) In his post-hearing submission this \naccount is listed in his debt relief program. (AE F) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.f, is  a charged-off account in the amount of $13,381 to the same \nbank as 1.d. Applicant stated that this is the same account. There is no documentary \nevidence of duplication. The other account was settled for $4,000 in October 2018. (AE \nC) Applicant stated that he would produce evidence after the hearing, but he did not. \n \n \nSOR 1. g, is an account past-due in the amount of $87,962, with a total balance of \n$220,550.  Applicant bought a house in 2005 and rented the property.  His tenants moved \nout and he could not replace them. (Tr.43) Applicant was late on his payments due to his \nfather and brother dying. He paid for the costs of their funerals. This mortgage loan was \nnot modified and Applicant stated the process took about three years but was not \napproved. ( AE E, Tr. 44) The house went to  foreclosure. Applicant knows the house was \nsold but does not know if there is a deficiency that is owed. He thinks the deficiency  might \nbe $2,000. (Tr. 90) He has not contacted the bank, but stated that he would pay the \namount. (Tr. 93)  \n \n\n4 \n \n \nAs to post-hearing submissions, Applicant presented a copy of a debt resolution \nagreement, dated November 6, 2019. The agreement has terms of 47 months with a total \nenrolled debt of $80,152. The program is to start on November 29, 2019, with a total \nmonthly payment of $1,204. The creditors listed on the account are not all the same as \nthe SOR allegations. Applicant also enclosed a 2016 credit report showing a score of 737. \nHe submitted a copy of a 2016 transaction history from a credit union for a used auto loan \nthat does not appear to match any of the SOR accounts. (AE F) \n \n \nApplicant earns about $150,000 a year. He received some advice from his church \nabout finances but not formal counseling. (Tr. 94). He has a savings account and a 401(k) \nin the amount of $10,000. There was no information about a budget or payment plans, \nbut in his 2019 debt relief program a budget is included. (AE F) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under the personal conduct guideline at 2.a. that he falsified \nmaterial facts on his 2016 SCA when answering Section 26: Financial Record. Applicant \ndid not list any delinquent debts, defaults, charged-off accounts or collection accounts. \nHe answered \u201cNo\u201d to each subsection in the Section. Applicant admitted that he did not \ndisclose any financial issues because he did not know about them. (Tr. 98) He \nacknowledged that he knew about the account in 1.a that he claims is fraudulent, but he \ndid not consider that as a debt since it was being disputed, and he was never asked for \nany payments. (Tr. 99) \n \n \nApplicant was confused at the hearing about the various accounts and said that \nsome of them were old. He also stated that he obtained loans for others because that \nwas what his father did to help people. He stated that he is trustworthy and intends to pay \nall his debts. (Tr. 102)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted six letters of reference from colleagues, friends, a cousin, and \nteam leader who attest to his technical skill and loyalty. He also submitted various \ncertifications that he has obtained over the years. (ANSWER) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n\n5 \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports and failure to provide \nsufficient documentation, establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \n\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \n\n7 \n \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant is disputing the debt concerning the car that he believes was a fraud \nperpetrated on him. He  settled two accounts in 2018. He stated that he was unemployed \nfor nine months and that he cared for his family for several years. However, he also gave \na check to his brother-in-law for $7,000 and did not follow up to see if payments were \nmade. He knew it was his responsibility, but he did not do anything. He stated that he has \nseveral payment plans but given an extension of time to provide evidence of such, he did \nnot do so. The evidence that he submitted did not related to the SOR allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant waited until 2018 to address any of the SOR allegations. He sent in \ndocumentation untimely that reflect he just signed a debt relief program and the payments \nhave yet to start. This is not sufficient mitigation in the case. He may have had \ncircumstances beyond his control but did not act responsibly. He has no track record of \nfinancial responsibility. He also took out loans so that he could help others. While that is \nlaudable, it does not show good judgment. He had nine months of unemployment and \ncould not pay all his own debts. He provided no evidence of payment arrangements or \nreceipts for any of the debts that he claimed he had in place. He waited until more than \nsixty-days after the hearing to obtain debt relief services to begin to address his financial \nissues.  He promises that he will pay all the debts. Promises to pay in the future are no \nsufficient for mitigation. Applicant acted too late in this case and has not met his burden \nof proof. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied allegation 2.a that he did not disclose any delinquencies \nand remained emphatic that he did not deliberately falsify his security \n\n8 \n \nclearance application by not disclosing any delinquent debts or colletion \naccounts in response to Section 26. He noted that he had not checked his \ncredit report and that he knew of the one debt that he was disputing. He \nstated that he was confronted with the other debts when he received the \nSOR and had the investigative interview. I found him credible in his \nassertion that he did not consider the mortgage a debt because he was in \nthe process of modification. He did not deliberately falsify his SCA in 2016.  \nAG 16(a) does not apply. \n \nHere, Applicant did not report information accurately on his SCA in addition to \nmaterial information about his debts on his  2016 SCA in Section 26. It is understandable \nthat he was not focusing on the fraud debt or the mortgage loan at the time he completed \nhis 2016 SCA and did not intentionally falsify his SCA. He met his burden under the \npersonal conduct guideline. AG 16(a) does not apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant is a generous man who has helped his family and others by gving them \nmoney. However, he obtained loans to do so. He acknowledged that he took loans to help \nothers as his father would do. After the hearing, he contacted a debt relief company. The \nterms are for 47 months and the monthly payment is $1,200. The payments do not begin \nuntil the end of November. There is no track record for applicant at this time. He did settle \ntwo accounts in 2018. However, this is not sufficient to mitigate the financial security \nconcerns.   \n \n \nHe was unemployed for nine months and took care of his family. However, he \nallowed himself to get into debt by doing so. He had some circumstances beyond his \n\n9 \n \ncontrol but did not act responsibly. He intends to pay his debts but promises to pay in the \nfuture are not sufficient for mitigation.  \n \n \nApplicant did not intentionally falsifiy his 2016 SCA in section 26. He was credible \nin his testimony that hedid not report the account that he believes was fraudulent and the \nhome loan mortgage was in the process of modification. He did not think that there was \nanything to list under the financial section. The personal conduct security concerns are \nnot established. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant:  \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), effective June 8, 2017 (AG).  \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 17, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 2, 2018. The evidence \n03/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 3-5 (Items 1 and 2 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on October \n16, 2018. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not file objections or submit any \nadditional evidence. Items 3-5 are admitted into evidence without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on February 14, 2019. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Iraq. Department Counsel \nprovided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide context for the requested \nfacts. The specific facts noticed are included in the Findings of Fact.1 \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings.2 Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from U.S. Government reports.3 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the SOR allegations. The \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s father, mother, two brothers, two sisters, and his \nbrother-in-law are citizens and residents of Iraq. It further alleged that one brother (B1) \nworks for the Ministry of Defense, Military Intelligence Branch. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c).  \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1977. He remained there until \nJanuary 2007 when he resided in Damascus, Syria, with his father. He was unemployed \nwhen he was living in Syria. He remained there until February 2008, when he returned \nto Iraq. He immigrated to the United States in 2010 through an international refugee \nprogram. He is seeking a clearance for a translator position with a federal contractor. \nFrom 2010 to the present, he has worked for a private employer. He is single, never \nmarried, with no children. He owns a home in the United States, but no further details \nare included in the record.4   \n \n                                                          \n1 The Government\u2019s request and the supporting background documents were marked as AD EX I. \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. \nBd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986). \n \n3 See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for \nadministrative notice).  \n \n4 Items 3-5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn 2014 and 2016, Applicant visited Iraq for approximately 30 days per visit. He \ntraveled to Iraq to see his family. While he was in Iraq in 2016, he renewed his Iraqi \npassport. He possesses current Iraqi and U.S. passports. From July to November 2004, \nApplicant was employed as a translator/linguist for a U.S. contractor in Iraq. He quit the \nposition because he felt it was too dangerous. In 2004, His brother-in-law was killed \nworking for the same contractor.5 \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \n \nApplicant has the following relatives who are residents and citizens of Iraq:  \n \n \n1. His mother. His mother is 68 years old. She is not affiliated with the \ngovernment or the military. Applicant has weekly telephone contact with her. In April \n2016, Applicant sponsored her for entry into the United States seeking U.S. permanent \nresidency status. So far, her visa has not been approved and she remains in Iraq.6  \n \n \n2. His father. His father is 71 years old. He was a counselor at the Ministry of \nJustice until he retired in 2004. Applicant has daily contact with his father. In April 2016, \nApplicant sponsored his father for entry into the United States seeking U.S. permanent \nresidency status. He was approved and moved to the U.S. to live with Applicant. When \nApplicant\u2019s mother\u2019s status remained unresolved, his father moved back to Iraq where \nhe currently resides. The record is unclear when this occurred. His father owns property \nin Iraq worth approximately $250,000. Applicant will inherit a portion of this property \nupon his father\u2019s death.7   \n \n \n3. Applicant\u2019s two brothers (B1 and B2). B1 is 38 years old. He is employed by \nthe Iraqi Ministry of Defense-Military Intelligence. He has worked there since \napproximately 2007. Applicant has monthly contact with B1. B2 is 33 years old. He \ncurrently resides in the United States with Applicant. He is a permanent resident alien \n(green card holder). He is employed by a private-sector company. Applicant has daily \ncontact with him.8 \n \n \n4. Applicant\u2019s sister (S1). His sister is 41 years old. She is a teacher in Iraq. She \nis married. Applicant has monthly telephone contact with S1.9 \n \n \n5. Applicant\u2019s sister (S2) and brother-in-law. S2 is 42 years old. She is a teacher \nin Iraq. Applicant has monthly telephone contact with S2. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is \n                                                          \n5 Item 5. \n \n6 Items 3-5. \n \n7 Items 3-5. \n \n8 Items 3-4. \n \n9 Items 3-4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmarried to S2. His brother-in-law worked for the Ministry of Higher Education and \nScientific Research until his retirement (date unknown).10 \n \nIraq \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq as \nconditions within the country remain dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. \ncitizens are at high risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel \nto Iraq. The U.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. government \npersonnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict \nsecurity guidelines. The Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) remained the greatest \nterrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Iraq and Syria. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n                                                          \n10 Items 3-4. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nrelationship between Iraq and the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith his relatives living in Iraq does not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be \nplaced in a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United \nStates and a desire to assist his relatives living in Iraq who might be coerced by \ngovernmental entities or pressured to assist Iraq.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d11 Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Iraq seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his relatives \nliving in Iraq, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s family members who are residents and citizens of \nIraq. AG \u00b6 7(c) also applies because B2 currently resides with Applicant. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n \n                                                          \n11 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s potential translator position could cause \nhim to be placed in a position to choose between the interests of his relatives and those \nof the United States. Applicant testified that he has regular contact with his relatives in \nIraq. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \n \nApplicant has not met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He worked as a translator for several months in \n2004 for U.S. forces in Iraq before he quit because of the dangers associated with the \njob. Additionally, he visited Iraq in 2016 and renewed his Iraqi passport. He is \napparently a homeowner in the United States, but additional details about his \nconnections to this country are lacking. His father owns substantial property in Iraq, \nwhich Applicant is due to inherit. The evidence supports the conclusion that Applicant \nhas substantial ties to Iraq. Because of those ties, it is unclear that he would resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s clearance are less significant than the factors weighing \ntowards denying his clearance. I also considered his ties to Iraq are just as strong, if not \nmore so, than his ties to the United States. At this point, the evidence does not support \nhis long-standing ties and connections to the United States. Therefore, he provided \ninsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence \nconcerns were not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On August 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 14, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 6, 2018.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November \n15, 2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 6, 2018. The \nGovernment offered six exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which \n\n \n2 \n \nwere admitted without objection. The Applicant offered one exhibit, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A which was admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his \nown behalf. The record remained open until close of business on December 13, 2018, \nto allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional supporting documentation.  \nApplicant submitted one document, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, \nwhich was admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non December 17, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 30 years old.  He is not married and has no children.  He has a high \nschool diploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a field technician.  He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR identified twelve delinquent debts totaling in excess of $42,000.  \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, except 1.a.  Credit reports \nof the Applicant dated June 24, 2017; and October 29, 2018, reflect that the debts are \nstill owing.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.) \n       \n \nApplicant admits that over the years he has lived beyond his means.  He has \nspent money he really could not afford, on his hobby, which is electronics.  He \nexplained that he enjoys buying computer parts in order to prepare to do graphic design \nand web design.  Until July 2015, he was able to pay his bills.  In July 2015, he was laid \noff from a previous job, and he did not find work for about three to four months.  (Tr. p. \n47.)  During this period, his credit cards were his only source of income and he \ncontinued to use them as though his income had not been effected.       \n \n \nApplicant started working for his current employer in 2017.  He states that he \ncould not find anyone affordable to help him with his finances until recently.  In October \n2018, Applicant hired a credit counselor to help him resolve his debt.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A.)  However, during his interview with an investigator in July 2017, when his \ndelinquent debts were brought to his attention, Applicant stated that he was planning to \npay his debts in full and/or would be setting up payments plans for his delinquent \naccounts by the end of 2018.  (Tr. p. 33, and Government Exhibit 2.) \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe following delinquent debts, consisting of bank and department store credit \ncards and personal loans, are still owing: \n \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to BMW Financial for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $14,874.  Applicant states that he co-signed for a friend for a car \nloan that his friend could not afford to pay.  (Tr. pp. 25 -26.)         \n \n1.b.  Applicant was indebted to Portfolio for an account that was placed in collection in \nthe approximate amount of $7,845.  (Tr. pp. 31 - 33.)    \n \n1.c.   Applicant was indebted to Wells Fargo Bank for an account that was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $4,880.  (Tr. pp. 33 - 34.)          \n \n1.d.  Applicant was indebted to Portfolio for an account that was placed in collection in \nthe approximate amount of $3,442.  (Tr. pp. 34 - 35.)           \n \n1.e.  Applicant was indebted to Wells Fargo Bank CD SVC for an account that was \ncharged off in the approximate amount of $2,643.  (Tr. pp. 35 - 36.)        \n \n1.f.  Applicant was indebted to SYNCB/PayPal for an account that was charged off in \nthe in the approximate amount of $413.  (Tr. p. 35.) \n \n1.g. Applicant is indebted to Portfolio for an account that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $2,373.  (Tr. pp. 36 - 37.)        \n \n1.h.  Applicant was indebted to Midland MCM for an account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $1,500.  (Tr. p. 37.)    \n \n1.i.   Applicant was indebted to TBOMMILSTN for an account that was past due in the \namount of $160 with a total approximate balance of $509.  Applicant states that he \nsettled the debt for about $350.  (Tr. p. 37.)        \n \n1.j.  Applicant was indebted to Midland MCM for an account that was placed in \ncollection in the approximate amount of $474.  (Tr. p. 39 - 40.)           \n \n1.k.  Applicant was indebted to SD County for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $232.  (Tr. p. 40.)      \n \n1.l.  Applicant was indebted to Midland Funding for an account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $3,654.  (Tr. p. 41.)  \n \n       Applicant admits that he got into this financial situation because he was spending \nbeyond his means.  He still has a lot of responsibilities that include helping his parents \npay the rent and taking care of other expenses, besides his own bills.  At the end of the \nmonth he is left with a very small amount of money that he has to manage to use for \ngas, food and other things.  (Tr. p. 46.)  Applicant states that he is currently trying to find \n\n \n4 \n \na better paying job.  He wants a stable income where he can use a portion of that \nincome to pay his bills and place the rest in savings.  (Tr. p. 50.)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n5 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has spent beyond his means and now has twelve delinquent debts.  He \nremains delinquently indebted in the amount of approximately $42,000.  Of the twelve \ndebts listed in the SOR, he has paid one of them.  Even his smaller debts have not \nbeen paid.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand   \n  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n  \nBut for a three or four month period following Applicant\u2019s job lay-off, Applicant \nhas been consistently employed and has received income.  Even so, since obtaining \nfull-time employment with a defense contractor in 2017, Applicant has done little to \nshow that he can or will resolve his debts.  He states that he hired a debt counselor, yet \nthere is nothing in the record to show that they have done anything to help him resolve \nhis debts.  Applicant has settled one debt, but the other eleven remain owing.  Even the \nsmaller debts that one would assume he could pay if nothing else, have not been paid.  \nHe has not set up payment plans with the creditors that he is following, nor has he paid \noff the outstanding debt.  There is no clear evidence in the record that he has acted \nreasonably and responsibly under the circumstances.  His actions reflect unreliability, \nuntrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

During his December 2017 \ninterview, Applicant stated that he stopped making payments and wanted verification of \nthe debt, because he never signed a promissory note with Bank B. He believed that his \nactions were valid based upon information he learned from the news.  He did not consult \nwith an attorney before he ceased making payments to the mortgage or HELOC \naccounts. Applicant testified that Bank B did not respond to his request for validation. The \noutstanding loan balance is nearly $320,000, and the account is almost $50,000 \ndelinquent. (GE 2 at 1; GE 3 at 6; AE 5; AE 11 at 2-3; AE 13; Tr. 26, 34-36, 40-42, 44-47, \n50) \n  \nIn February 2017, Bank B sent Applicant notice of its intent to foreclose on his \nhome. A month later, Applicant and his wife, representing themselves, filed a lawsuit \nagainst Bank B, claiming they no longer owed Bank B any money. In April 2018, a stay \nwas entered to prevent Bank B from foreclosing on Applicant\u2019s home pending the \noutcome of his lawsuit against Bank B. (GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; AE 5; AE 11 at 2-3; AE 13; \nTr. 46-48, 50-) \n \nIn June of 2018, the court found in favor of Bank B and dismissed Applicant\u2019s \nlawsuit. That same month, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to prevent Bank B \nfrom foreclosing on his home. Shortly thereafter, the Chapter 7 bankruptcy was \ndismissed, because it was determined that Applicant had sufficient income and resources \nto pay his financial obligations. In July 2018, Applicant appealed the court\u2019s dismissal of \nhis lawsuit. (GE 5; GE 6; GE 7; Tr. 27-29, 48, 50) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that in August 2018, the Chapter 7 bankruptcy was converted \ninto a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to allow him to resolve the mortgage and HELOC debts. He \nalso wanted the trustee to determine if the mortgage and HELOC debts were valid. There \nwas no evidence presented during the hearing that Applicant made any bankruptcy \npayments. (GE 7; Tr. 27-28, 49, 51-53)  \n \nIn October 2018, the Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed based upon \nApplicant\u2019s request. According to Applicant, the bankruptcy was no longer necessary to \nprotect his interest in his home, because the mortgage debt and HELOC were \u201cpaid in \nfull\u201d and he wished to \u201cpursue his claims against\u201d Bank B and Bank C in state court. At \nthe hearing, Applicant reiterated that he paid in full the mortgage debt and HELOC, and \nthis belief is reflected in his personal financial statement. (GE 7; AE 2; AE 3; AE 6; AE 7; \nAE 8; AE 9; AE 10; AE 12; Tr. 27-28, 33, 51-52, 67)  \n \nApplicant testified that his failure to pay his primary mortgage and HELOC is based \non a civil dispute, not an inability to pay the mortgages, as he is able to live within his \nmeans. If he is found to be legally responsible for the two mortgage debts, he claimed he \nwill pay both debts. Applicant continues to reside in the home with his family, and the \nforeclosure proceedings are stayed, pending the outcome of Applicant\u2019s appeal. Applicant \nis representing himself in the appeal process. (GE 5; GE 6; Tr. 28, 33, 52-57, 62, 67) \n \nDespite his multiple claims that the mortgage and HELOC have been paid in full, \nat the hearing, Applicant admitted that he has not paid $320,000 plus interest to Bank B, \nnor has he paid $70,000 plus interest to Bank C. His claims that he paid both accounts in \nfull are based upon Bank B and Bank C failing to provide the validation that he requested. \nApplicant\u2019s wife has been continuously employed throughout their dispute with the \nlenders. (Tr. 28, 52, 63) \n \nApplicant owes the Internal Revenue Service approximately $3,500 for tax year \n2017, and at the time of the hearing he did not have a payment arrangement. Additionally, \nhe owes approximately $1,000 in property taxes for his house. (Tr. 57-59) \n \nApplicant works with charity organizations. (Tr. 25) His work has been recognized \nwith numerous certificates of appreciation, and he was awarded an employee of the year \naward from his current employer. He is proud that he has contributed to creating secure \nnetwork systems for the government. (Tr. 25-26) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n5 \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant purchased a home in 2002, he made payments toward his mortgage. In \n2004, the debt was transferred to a second mortgage company. At that time, Applicant \ndid not dispute the legitimacy of the transfer or Bank B\u2019s ownership of the loan. He \ncontinued to make monthly payments for over ten more years. In 2005, Applicant opened \n\n \n6 \n \na HELOC and made payments for over ten years. There is no evidence that this debt was \ntransferred or held by a secondary company. \n \nIn approximately 2015, Applicant developed a belief, based upon information he \nlearned from a news program, that if he requested validation from both Bank B and Bank \nC, and they failed to provide proof of the promissory notes that he signed, he no longer \nowed either company any money. He did not consult with an attorney to determine if this \nwas a valid dispute, but discontinued making payments toward the mortgage and HELOC \naccounts. Applicant continued to reside in the home, but has not made mortgage \npayments since approximately early 2017.  \n \nApplicant filed a lawsuit against Bank B in 2017, this lawsuit was dismissed in June \n2018. He is currently appealing that decision; however, he did not consult with an attorney \nduring the initial court proceeding, nor did he consult with an attorney when he filed an \nappeal. Applicant filed for bankruptcy to prevent Bank B from foreclosing on his home, \nbut there is no evidence that he made any payments into the bankruptcy. \n \nApplicant\u2019s assertions that he is not responsible for the mortgage and HELOC \ndebts because he has a valid basis to dispute the legitimacy of the debts are insufficient \nto mitigate the SOR allegations. There is no evidence that either bank acted in an \ninappropriate manner, which was validated by the lower court\u2019s dismissal of Applicant\u2019s \nlawsuit. Additionally, there is no evidence that Applicant was unable to pay the alleged \ndebts due to financial issues beyond his control. Rather, it was a conscience choice and \nremained a choice, even after the lawsuit was dismissed, and the SOR was issued.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues further demonstrate that his financial issues are not isolated \nand raise additional questions regarding his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nMitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) was not established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n \nI conclude Applicant did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. He failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E.

Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.            \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn September 12, 2016, Applicant signed a security clearance application (SCA). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On October 12, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines F and B. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nOn January 24, 2019, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he \nrequested a hearing. On June 5, 2019, the case was assigned to me, and on the same \nday, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, \nsetting the hearing for June 25, 2019. Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.   \n  \n\n2 \n                                         \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant did not \noffer any exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. At Department Counsel\u2019s request, I took judicial notice of relevant facts about \nThailand. (Tr. 65-67) I held the record open for 30 days in the event either party wanted \nto submit additional documentation. (Tr. 9-11, 13-14; GE 1-4) On July 8, 2019, DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript. After the hearing, the Government timely provided one \nexhibit, a current credit report, which was admitted without objection. (Tr. 12; GE 5) The \nrecord closed on July 25, 2019.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, but he \nlisted these debts had been charged off and he was no longer responsible. He denied the \ndebts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, and 1.f-1.h. He admitted the single SOR allegation under Guideline B \n(\u00b6 2.a). He did not provide any supporting documentation at the hearing, or during the 30-\nday period the record was held open. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 61 years old and he is seeking employment as a truck driver for a \ngovernment contractor. He obtained his high school diploma in 1975. Between 1978 and \n2005, Applicant was married on five separate occasions, and one woman he married \ntwice. He does not have any children, and he is currently married to a U.S. naturalized \ncitizen from Thailand. His wife is a truck driver for a government contractor and she \ncurrently possess a DOD security clearance. Applicant has been her partner on \nunclassified cargo assignments. They operate as owner operators of their personally \nowned truck. They are leased through a limited liability company, where his wife is the \nowner. He is not currently employed and has no source of income. His wife makes about \n$25,000 annually and she financially supports Applicant. (Tr. 8, 39-40, 43-47, 49; GE 1, \nGE 2)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe amount of debt alleged in the SOR is approximately $38,000. Applicant listed \nin his SOR response and testified at the hearing that after his accounts were charged off, \nhe may be morally responsible for the charged-off debt, but he is no longer legally \nresponsible for resolving the debt. Applicant claimed he received this legal advice from \nhis attorney. (Tr. 15-16) \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, and the record establishes the status of \nApplicant\u2019s accounts as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $16,910. Applicant opened the account \nto pay for his back and neck surgeries in 2014. He made payments totaling approximately \n$1,000 in 2014. He claimed that he obtained a letter from his medical insurance, Medicaid, \ninforming him that his medical account had been paid in full. The creditor disagreed that \nhis medical insurance fully paid the cost of his medical procedures. Applicant has not \nmade any payments on this account since 2014, and since it has been charged off as a \nbad debt, he stated he is no longer legally responsible for this account. The July 2019 \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \ncredit report showed this account as charged off. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 16-22, 54-\n55, 61; GE 5) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e allege three credit card accounts charged off as bad \ndebts in the total amount of $10,779. Applicant testified that he recognized these accounts \nas his, but since they have been charged off, he is no longer legally responsible for these \noutstanding credit card accounts. The July 2019 credit report verified that these accounts \nwere charged off. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 22-25, 27-29; GE 5) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a credit card debt referred for collection in the total amount of \n$5,580. Applicant testified that he is uncertain if this is his debt. He received letters from \nthe collection agency, but he has never made any inquiries with the creditor to determine \nwhether this is his account. All of the letters he received from the collection agency were \nplaced in the trash. During his November 2017 background interview, Applicant admitted \nthis credit card account. The July 2019 credit report showed this outstanding account as \ndisputed by the consumer. Applicant does not intend to pay or resolve this debt. (Tr. 25-\n27, 64; GE 2, GE 5) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a medical debt referred for collection in the total amount of \n$3,000. Applicant denied this allegation in his SOR response. At the hearing, he stated \nthat he does not know what this account pertains to, so he has not paid it or made any \ninquiries with the creditor. He was asked about this debt and the other SOR delinquent \nobligations during his November 2017 background interview. Again, he knew they were \na concern to the government in January 2019 when the delinquent accounts were \nincluded in the SOR. Yet by June 2019, he has still not investigated them. Obviously, he \ndoes not care about his finances and is a poor security risk. The October 2016 credit \nreport in evidence documented the debt, and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 29-30, 55; GE \n3)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, and 1.h allege medical debts referred for collection in the total amount \nof $725. Applicant denied these allegations in his SOR response because he believed \nthese debts were paid in full for $1,100. The October 2016 credit report documented the \ndelinquent debts. He testified that he had a cancelled check showing his payment in full. \nApplicant failed to provide supporting documentation during the 30-day period the record \nwas held open. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 30-31, 55, 57-58; GE 3) \n \nDuring his November 2017 background interview, Applicant had about $50,000 in \nsavings. At the hearing he stated that he currently had about $16,000 in savings. He will \nnot use this money to pay off delinquent debts. He is saving this money for the time when \nhe begins to draw Social Security benefits, and he will use the money to supplement his \nincome. He and his wife are current on their monthly expenses, and they have not \ndeveloped any new delinquent debt. Applicant has not participated in any financial \ncounseling. (Tr. 8, 31-32, 63; GE 2) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens and residents of \nThailand, and he provides them with monthly financial support. Applicant admitted this \nallegation in the SOR response. His spouse speaks with her parents on the telephone \nthree to four times a week. Appellant and his wife provide them with approximately $100-\n$200 monthly financial support. Appellant does not communicate with his in-laws due to \ntheir language barrier. His mother-in-law is a homemaker, and his father-in-law is a retired \nbus driver. Applicant\u2019s in-laws do not have any affiliation with the Government of Thailand. \n(Tr. 35-38, 65-67; GE 2) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n5 \n                                         \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n  \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant suffered a serious medical condition that required two surgeries in 2014, \nwhich is a circumstance beyond his control. The medical expense contributed to his \nfinancial issues. However, to receive full credit for this mitigating condition, Applicant must \nshow that he acted responsibly under the circumstances, which he failed to do. Applicant \nsimply chose not to pay these debts after they were charged-off accounts. At the time of \nhis background interview, he had sufficient funds in savings to satisfy all of his outstanding \naccounts, but he did not to take any responsible action to resolve his debts. There is no \nevidence that he received financial counseling, or that he initiated a good-faith effort to \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nrepay his financial obligations. Applicant failed to provide documentation that he has a \nlegitimate basis to dispute any of his outstanding accounts, and he failed to provide a \ncopy of a cancelled check to show that he has paid or resolved a debt alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant has known about the Government\u2019s concern over his delinquent accounts since \nhis November 2017 interview, and the debts remain unpaid and unaddressed. Under all \nof these circumstances, Applicant failed to establish that financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated.  \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nAlthough the United States and Thailand have had disagreements after the 2014 \nmilitary coup which deposed an elected civilian government, the U.S.-Thai alliance \nremains in place and Washington and Bangkok are mending relations after a period of \ntension. Thailand is generally regarded in the United States as a friendly country. \nHowever, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes \na risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a close relationship with an individual \nliving under a foreign government. The mere possession of a close relationship with an \nindividual in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. \nIf an applicant has such a relationship, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential \nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation.   \n \nAs noted in the Government\u2019s Administrative Notice documents, a heightened risk \nis associated with Thailand with its persistent violence and human-rights problems. The \nevidence and Applicant\u2019s admission that his wife maintains frequent and regular contact \nwith family members in Thailand, coupled with continuing financial support for his parents-\nin-law, are sufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are \nestablished.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant has lived in the United States all of his life. Based on his deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, I am confident that Applicant \nwould resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is \nestablished. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is established since Applicant\u2019s contacts with his parents-in-law are \ninfrequent and extremely limited due to their inability to communicate. His mother-in-law \nis a homemaker, and his father-in-law is a retired bus driver, with no affiliation with the \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nThai Government. There is little likelihood that his parents-in-law could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s honesty in self-reporting his foreign connections, and the candor he \nexhibited at hearing are sufficient to fully mitigate the security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s familial connections to Thailand. Applicant can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest with respect to Thailand in favor of the United States. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nB are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 61 years old, and he is seeking employment as a truck driver for a \ngovernment contractor. He mitigated the security concerns raised by his foreign family \nmembers in Thailand. \n \nApplicant did not provide any evidence of payments, payment plans, or other \nactions to resolve the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He has taken the position that \nhe is no longer legally responsible for any charged-off accounts. His actions show a lack \nof financial responsibility and raise unmitigated questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Corrales, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. Eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 9, 2016, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a set of interrogatories. On September 11, 2018, \nApplicant responded to those interrogatories. On October 15, 2018, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n04/23/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n2016) (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse), J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed \nreasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on October 30, 2018. In a notarized statement, dated \nJanuary 3, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case decided \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on March 1, 2019, and he \nwas afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the \nFORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on March 7, 2019. His \nresponse was due on April 6, 2019. Applicant timely submitted one document in response \nto the FORM, and it was admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on \nApril 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the factual allegations \npertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse of the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c.); \nand two of the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d. and 2.f.). \nHe denied the remaining allegations as well as the principal allegation pertaining to \npersonal conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and \nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a mechanic with his current employer since February 2014. A 2000 high school \ngraduate, Applicant attended a technical institute and received a heating, ventilation, and \nair conditioning (HVAC) certification in 2001. He has never served with the U.S. military. \nHe was granted an interim security clearance at some unspecified point between \nSeptember 2016 and February 2018.1 Applicant has never been married, but he has six \nchildren, born in 2002, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2016. \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.): Applicant was a substance abuser whose primary substance of \nchoice was marijuana. He started using and purchasing marijuana in 1997, when he was \napproximately 15 years old. He started smoking marijuana at least weekly, and that \n                                                          \n1 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February 19, 2018), at 8. \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nfrequency continued until approximately 2012 or 2013. Thereafter, until December 2017, \nhe purportedly reduced his marijuana use to one or two times per year. During his \ninterview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in \nFebruary 19, 2018, Applicant admitted that his most recent use of marijuana occurred two \nweeks before he was interviewed.2 However, he changed his story in his response to the \ninterrogatories when he stated that his last and most recent use of marijuana occurred in \nDecember 2017.3 Regardless of the most recent date, Applicant\u2019s last use was well after \nhe submitted his 2016 e-QIP. Applicant indicated that marijuana made him calm and \nenabled him to relax. While he did not consider himself to be dependent upon marijuana, \nas of his OPM interview, he was unable to quit altogether. Applicant never grew \nmarijuana, and he generally purchased it \u201coff the streets,\u201d as he does not have a supplier. \n   \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): In November 2015, while in a foreign country, Applicant was arrested \nby the local police for suspected violations of the Cannabis Control Act and the nation\u2019s \ncustoms law. A female friend whom Applicant had met during a temporary assignment in \nthe United States shipped him a package containing marijuana cookies. Applicant \nclaimed that he was unaware that the package had been shipped to him, that he never \nexpected it, and that he never received it. The package was intercepted by customs \nauthorities. On November 23, 2015, pursuant to a search warrant, the police searched \nhis hotel room and seized a glass pipe containing traces of marijuana. Applicant was \narrested and taken to the local precinct where he was held for 21 days, after which the \nlocal prosecutor declined to prosecute Applicant. He was released.4  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he decided to stop using marijuana due to new religious \nbeliefs; that he no longer associates with persons using illegal substances; and that he \nno longer frequents locations where drugs are being used. In his responses to the \ninterrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that he had never participated in a drug or \nalcohol treatment rehabilitation program, or received any counseling. Instead, he \npractices self-control and prays. However, in his response to the FORM, he stated that \nhe planned to attend his first Narcotics Anonymous meeting on April 1, 2019.5 \n \nIn addition to marijuana, Applicant also had a relationship with cocaine, not by \nusing it, but rather by selling it as a sideline activity to raise extra cash. He contended that \nhe last did so about seven years before his 2018 OPM interview, which would make his \nmost recent sale as taking place in approximately 2011.  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c.): On or about July 2, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with \npossession of a firearm while in possession of drugs, a felony; and manufacturing, sales, \nand possession of a controlled substance, also a felony. The controlled substance was \n                                                          \n2 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 8. \n \n3 Item 4 (Response to Interrogatories, dated September 11, 2018), at 1. \n \n4 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 7-8. \n \n5 Item 4 (Response to Interrogatories), supra note 3, at 1; Response to the FORM, undated. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \napproximately one gram of cocaine. The charges were dismissed in September 2003.6 \nApplicant contended that the charges were dismissed because the search of his vehicle \nwas \u201cillegal.\u201d7 \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nIn addition to the criminal conduct associated with Applicant\u2019s drug involvement \nand substance misuse, described above, Applicant has a history of arrests and charges \nfor a variety of activities:  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b.): On May 24, 2010, he was charged with contempt of court for failure \nto appear, a misdemeanor. On December 9, 2011, he was found guilty of the charge, and \nhe was ordered to pay restitution;8 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 2.c.): On November 24, 2010, he was charged with contempt of court. No \ndisposition was recorded;9 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 2.d.): On October 28, 2011, after being in a bar fight protecting the mother \nof one of his children from an assault, he was arrested and charged with malicious \nwounding, a felony. He and the other individual involved remained in jail overnight. At the \nsubsequent court hearing in February 2012, no witnesses appeared, and the charge was \nnolle prossed;10 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 2.e.): On May 1, 2014, he was charged with contempt of court. In \nSeptember 2014, the charge was dismissed;11 and \n \n(SOR \u00b6 2.f.): On June 24, 2016, he was arrested and charged with assault and \nbattery on a family member, a misdemeanor, after he slapped his daughter in the face, \nbusting her lip. The child\u2019s mother called the police. Applicant appeared in the juvenile \nand domestic relations court in July 2017, and the court ordered a two-year deferment \n(under advisement) with eventual and dismissal, providing Applicant completes a \nparenting class and an anger management course.12 Thus, he remains in this status until \nJuly 2019. As of February 19, 2018, Applicant claimed that he had completed the \n                                                          \n6 Item 5 (Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Identification Record (IR), dated September 17, \n2016), at 5; Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 6. \n \n7 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 6. \n \n8 Item 5 (FBI IR), supra note 6, at 5. \n \n9 Item 5 (FBI IR), supra note 6, at 5. \n \n10 Item 5 (FBI IR), supra note 6, at 6; Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5. \n \n11 Item 5 (FBI IR), supra note 6, at 6. \n \n12 Item 6 (Case Details, dated September 25, 2018); Item 5 (FBI IR), supra note 6, at 6; Item 4 \n(Enhanced Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5-6. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nparenting class at a local church, one evening per week for six weeks, but he \nacknowledged that he had not yet taken the anger management course, and such a \ncourse was not yet scheduled.13 As of the closing of the record, Applicant had not \nsubmitted any evidence that he had completed the anger management course, that the \ncharges had been dismissed, or that he remains \u201cunder advisement.\u201d \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a.): This allegation cross-references the SOR allegations associated \nwith Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse, and criminal conduct. \n(SOR \u00b6 3.b.):  On September 9, 2016, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he \nresponded to certain questions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found \nin Section 23. The most significant question, and the one alleged in the SOR, was \nessentially as follows: In the last seven (7) years have you illegally used any drugs or \ncontrolled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance includes injecting, snorting, \ninhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming any drug or controlled \nsubstance. Two other questions, while not alleged in the SOR,14 were also asked: In the \nlast seven (7) years have you been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, \ncultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, handling or sale of any \ndrug or controlled substance?; and Have you ever illegally used or otherwise been \ninvolved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other \nthan previously listed? Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the combined questions.15 He omitted \nthe November 2015 violation of the foreign Cannabis Control Act and customs law for \nwhich he was in jail for 21 days; his admitted use of marijuana that continued until after \nthe e-QIP was completed; his purchases of marijuana; and the fact that he held an interim \nsecurity clearance at some unspecified point between September 2016 (when he was still \nusing marijuana) and February 2018. He certified that his responses to those questions \nwere \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, because \nof his omissions, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.  \nOther than simply denying that he had deliberately falsified material facts in his e-\nQIP, Applicant has not offered any explanations for the omissions. He did not claim, for \n                                                          \n13 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 6. \n \n14 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged \ndrug activity will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.  \n \n15 Item 3 (e-QIP, dated September 9, 2016), at 31. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nexample, that he misinterpreted the questions, or that he forgot his drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d16 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d17   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d18 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.19  \n                                                          \n16 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n17 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n18 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n19 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d20  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d21 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n                                                          \n \n20 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n21 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and  \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \nApplicant admittedly purchased, possessed and used marijuana for approximately \ntwo decades; was arrested in a foreign country in 2015 for receiving marijuana, and \npossession of a glass pipe containing traces of marijuana; and was arrested in 2003 for \nmanufacturing, sale, and possession of a controlled substance (cocaine). He also \nadmittedly sold cocaine. Although Applicant claimed during his OPM interview, and \nthereafter in his responses to the SOR and the FORM that he would no longer use illegal \nsubstances, because he continued to use marijuana even after he completed his e-QIP, \nhis recent conversion does not rise to the level of clearly and convincingly being \ncommitted to discontinuing such substance misuse. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), 25(f), and 25(g) \nhave been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) minimally apply. Applicant\u2019s two decades of drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse associated with marijuana was not infrequent, and it \ncontinued until at least December 2017 or February 2018, depending on which version of \nApplicant\u2019s story is to be believed. On the other hand, his involvement with the sale of \ncocaine apparently ceased with his arrest in July 2003, and there is no evidence that he \nhas had any more recent involvement. Although Applicant denied any drug involvement \non his e-QIP, upon being confronted by the OPM investigator, he finally acknowledged \nhis history with drugs. However, because of his changing narrative regarding his most \nrecent use of marijuana and the commencement of his supposed abstinence, there is \nsome question regarding the accuracy of his current claim of abstinence and his claim \nthat he has avoided drug-using individuals and locations where drugs are being used. \nApplicant claimed that one of the reasons for his new attitude regarding drugs is due to \nhis new religious beliefs, but he failed to explain what those beliefs are with respect to \ndrugs, and when he first started following those beliefs. \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s purported period of abstinence from illegal and authorized \nsubstances is to be encouraged, considering the lengthy period of his drug involvement \nand substance misuse, even accepting Applicant\u2019s stated period of such abstinence, the \nperiod of abstinence is simply too brief to establish confidence that a relapse will not \noccur. Under the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s actions continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security concerns: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;  \n \n(c)  individual is currently on parole or probation; and \n \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse is \nadopted herein. Applicant has established a lengthy pattern of criminality involving \nfelonies and misdemeanors, commencing with his 2003 arrest and continuing through his \n2016 arrest. They include a variety of charges, police involvement, court involvement, \nand results. He was jailed from overnight to three weeks, and is currently under \nadvisement. Some charges were dismissed or nolle prossed. Applicant\u2019s willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations is suspect, for he routinely ignored the law when \nhe consistently purchased, possessed, and used marijuana; possessed and sold cocaine; \nwas in contempt of court on several occasions; got into a bar fight; and assaulted a family \nmember. The \u201cunder advisement\u201d designation is akin to a probation. Moreover, while \nApplicant is to be under advisement until July 2019, and he has offered no evidence that \nhe has completed one of the requirements set out by the court \u2013 completion of an anger \nmanagement course \u2013 it appears that he has not, and may not, complete the court-\nmandated program. Based on the actions described above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), 31(c), \nand 31(d) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense;  \nand  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. While a substantial period may have \nelapsed since his 2003 arrest, Applicant\u2019s other more recent criminal behavior simply \ncontinued until at least December 2017 or February 2018. He is a recidivist, displaying a \nlong pattern of drug involvement and substance misuse from 1997, with and without \npolice or court involvement; contempt of court charges; and two incidents involving \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nphysical assaults (malicious wounding in 2011, and assault and battery of a family \nmember in 2016). Furthermore, he is still under advisement for his most recent charges. \nApplicant did not offer any evidence of a good employment record or constructive \ncommunity involvement.  \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, but \nin this instance, the most recent criminal conduct, in this case involving his continued drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, was in December 2017 or February 2018. Given his \ncavalier attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, Applicant\u2019s history of criminal \nconduct, under the circumstances, continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse, and \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct, are adopted herein. At the time Applicant completed his e-\nQIP in September 2016, he concealed any references to his history of drug involvement \nand substance misuse, although at that time, he was still using marijuana. Applicant\u2019s \ncomments provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions were deliberate \nfalsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely inaccurate answers that were the result of \noversight or misunderstanding of the true facts on his part. Proof of incorrect answers, \nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when \nthe falsification or omission occurred. As an administrative judge, I must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the alleged \nfalsifications or omissions occurred.  \n \nI have considered the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s denial of the SOR \nallegation, and have noticed his failure to address the allegation with any specific \nexplanation.22 Applicant\u2019s simple denial, without any explanations for his e-QIP response, \nin my view, is simply not persuasive evidence of Applicant\u2019s actual intent. In addition, \naside from his lack of candor with respect to the e-QIP, there is Applicant\u2019s lengthy history \nof drug involvement and substance misuse, his criminal conduct, and his personal \nconduct. As to the deliberate falsification on the e-QIP regarding his drug activity, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(a) and 16(c) have been established. As to the combined drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, criminal conduct, and Applicant\u2019s personal conduct allegations, AG \u00b6 \n16(c) has been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n                                                          \n22 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden \nof persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). See also ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (noting an applicant\u2019s level of \neducation and other experiences are part of entirety-of-the-record evaluation as to whether a failure to \ndisclose [significant facts] on an application was deliberate).  \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nNeither of the conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse continued until at least December 2017 or February 2018; and his false \nresponse to the e-QIP inquiries occurred in September 2016, before he supposedly \nstopped using marijuana. Applicant was confronted with the true facts by an OPM \ninvestigator in February 2018, but before that interview, he made no efforts to correct the \nomissions, concealments, or falsifications. Far from being infrequent, Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse was routine for decades, and his attitude towards \nlaws, rules, and regulations also lasted for a lengthy period. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.23  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 37-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a mechanic with his current \nemployer since February 2014. A 2000 high school graduate, Applicant received an \n                                                          \n23 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nHVAC certification in 2001. He has purportedly been abstinent from illegal substances \nsince December 2017 or February 2018. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant admittedly purchased, possessed and used, marijuana; possessed and sold \ncocaine; violated a foreign country\u2019s Cannabis Control Act and customs law; was arrested \nand charged with a variety of criminal violations; and lied on his e-QIP when he denied \ndrug involvement and substance misuse during the last seven years when, in fact, he was \nstill using marijuana. Because of his assault and battery charge of a family member in \n2016, he is still under advisement until July 2019, and he has not yet completed the court-\nmandated requirements. In addition, while the SOR did not allege it, Applicant held an \ninterim security clearance at some unspecified point between September 2016 (when he \nwas still using marijuana) and February 2018.  \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse; criminal conduct; and personal conduct. See SEAD \n4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a. and 3.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n__________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/29/2019 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant caused the improper shipment of classified hardware to a foreign \nmilitary in February 2013, in violation of security and export control requirements. In June \n2014, he placed an order for classified parts from a foreign vendor without contract \nsecurity classification specifications in existence to ensure that the classified hardware \nwould be protected. Applicant and his employer have implemented procedures to \npreclude a recurrence. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 22, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline K, handling protected information, and explaining \nwhy it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue his access to classified information. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \n\n2 \n \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn November 19, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). On April 10, 2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing \nto determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. On April 15, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for \nMay 7, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) \nwere admitted in evidence, which included as GE 2 administrative inquiries detailing the \nsecurity violations alleged in the SOR. A December 27, 2018 letter forwarding the \nproposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked as hearing exhibits (HEs \nI-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Four Applicant exhibits (AEs A-D) were \nadmitted in evidence without any objections. Applicant testified, as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received by DOHA on June 4, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline K that, in about April 2016, Applicant was \nfound culpable by his employer for the improper shipment/unauthorized export of \nclassified hardware in 2013 from his employer to a foreign country (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that, \nin about May 2016, he was found culpable by his employer for placing a purchase order \nwith a foreign supplier per the direction of the lead engineer without verifying that a \ncontractual relationship outlining security procedures was in place (SOR \u00b6 1.b). When \nhe answered the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted his role in the violations. He \nprovided a detailed response in which he attributed the violations to his failure to \nvalidate information provided by the program engineer manager, who had given him \n\u201cincorrect or overly broad advice.\u201d Applicant detailed steps taken to address the \nsystemic issues and knowledge gaps within his company that contributed to the \nviolations. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old married father with two daughters, ages 21 and 20. He \nhas a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in June 1989. He has worked for his employer since \ncollege. He has held his current Secret clearance since June 2004. He received annual \nsecurity trainings to as recently as January 2019. (GE 1; Tr. 40-43.)   \n \n \nA violation of the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) prompted \nApplicant\u2019s employer to have an independent party review all shipments in the previous \nfive years involving a technical program (program). The review discovered two security \nviolations involving the program for which Applicant and an engineering manager in the \nprogram management office (engineer X) were deemed culpable. The details of those \nviolations are as follows. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nThe first violation (SOR \u00b6 1.a) involved the shipment of classified hardware as \nunclassified to a foreign military in 2013. In February 2011, a foreign military placed a \n\u201creplenishment spares order\u201d (RSO) for ten units of a part that was identified in the RSO \nas Confidential. A supply chain manager, Applicant processed the order for his \nemployer. He identified an authorized supplier, who requested the classified drawing \nneeded to build the part. In March 2011, the then lead engineer on the program notified \nApplicant and three export/import (EX/IM) managers that there was no license \nauthorizing the export of the classified hardware to the foreign country, and that \nshipment of the parts was dependent on approval of a DSP-85 export license for \nclassified material. The export license was approved in early June 2011. (GE 2; Tr. 45-\n46.) \n \n \nIn November 2012, the manufacturer sent ten units of the hardware to a \ncompany approved for off-site storage and shipping (shipping agent) of the program\u2019s \nrepair and return hardware. After nine of the ten units failed an onsite inspection by \nApplicant\u2019s employer, the hardware was returned to the manufacturer for repair. The \nrepaired parts were received by the shipping agent in early December 2012. In mid-\nJanuary 2013, the shipping agent notified Applicant and a procurement specialist, who \nas a subordinate assisted Applicant in export control matters, that it would export the \nparts under the export license to the attention of the security officer. Two days later, on \nApplicant\u2019s order, Applicant\u2019s assistant notified the shipping agent that the hardware \nwas not classified, so the shipment should be marked for the supply department. In mid-\nFebruary 2013, the ten units were exported as unclassified hardware by the shipping \nagent to the foreign military, who received the parts, but did not alert Applicant\u2019s \nemployer about the improper shipment. (GE 2; Tr. 46-48.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed on March 3, 2016, about the shipment during an \nadministrative inquiry by his employer into the violation. Applicant explained that the \nprogram team was aware the parts were classified when the purchase order was \nplaced. However, in late 2012, he had a discussion with engineer X, who was new to his \nposition in the program management office and was the authorization official for the \npurchase order. Applicant indicated that engineer X told him that the part was not \nclassified in a steady state, but that the frequency data inputted during testing was \nclassified, so it then became a classified part. He and engineer X jointly decided that \nbecause the part would be shipped in a steady state without the frequency data, it was \nnot classified. (GE 2; Tr. 34, 49-50.) Applicant relied on engineer X, who had been the \nquality inspection manager and had more expertise about the hardware. (Tr. 51-52.) \nApplicant acknowledged during his employer\u2019s administrative inquiry that he had told his \nassistant to notify the shipping agent to ship the order as unclassified. (GE 2; Tr. 52.) \nApplicant and the lead engineer were deemed culpable for causing a security violation \nin that the classified hardware was not shipped in accord with the marking and \npackaging requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual \n(NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M. They also committed an ITAR violation because the \nhardware was shipped under a DSP-5 export license for unclassified parts and not a \nDSP-85 export license for classified parts. (Tr. 52.) Applicant\u2019s employer concluded that \nbecause the classified parts were not properly marked or packaged, the parts were \n\n4 \n \nvulnerable to unauthorized disclosure for the duration of the shipment, which was \napproximately 16 days, and that compromise was suspected. (GE 2; Tr. 53.) Applicant \nnow understands that he should have sought additional guidance to verify the \nclassification level for the parts. (Tr. 50-51.) \n \n \nThe second violation (SOR \u00b6 1.b) involved the placement of an order for \nclassified parts with a foreign supplier without the proper security agreements. In June \n2014, engineer X sent an email to Applicant that a Technical Assist Agreement (TAA) \nwith the foreign supplier allowed for the procurement of \u201cpretty much anything classified \nor unclassified.\u201d (AEs A-B; Tr. 54.) The TAA itself provided that \u201c[c]lassified information \nand material generated under this agreement must be assigned a security classification \nas specified by the separate contract(s) security classification specifications provided \nwith the contract(s).\u201d (GE 2.) Under the TAA, the foreign supplier was specifically \nauthorized to produce unclassified electromechanical parts and assembly components \nfor the system. (GE 2.) Acting on the advice of engineer X, who as \u201cAuthorization \nOwner\u201d for program licenses served as liaison between the EX/IM staff and the \nprogram, Applicant placed a purchase order by email with the foreign supplier for ten \nunits each of two parts that were classified as Confidential. (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 26, 56.) \nThe purchase order contained a mix of classified and non-classified line items. \nApplicant identified those parts which were classified on the purchase order. (AE A.) \nThe purchase order indicated in the header \u201cClassified Items Exist: No.\u201d However, in the \ndetails about the order, Applicant noted \u201cL/I 10 and 20 MUST BE MARKED AS \nCLASSIFIED.\u201d (AE B; Tr. 27.) Before placing the order, Applicant was responsible for \nensuring that there was a current Contract Security Specification (a DD 254) or a \nSecurity Aspects Letter, which was utilized by the company for classified production \nwith foreign vendors without a DD 254. Applicant did not review the TAA and did not \nverify that a contractual relationship outlining security procedures was in place. There \nwas no DD 254 or Security Aspects Letter for the foreign supplier. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 26-27, \n59.) Applicant understands that he should have sought clarification or validation about \nthe scope of the procurement authorization. (Tr. 55.) He cites the low volume of \nclassified purchase orders placed by him as a factor in his failure to ensure that there \nwas a DD 254 for the vendor. (Tr. 58.)  \n \n \nThe classified parts were to be imported for inspection by Applicant\u2019s employer \nbefore being exported. Four days after Applicant placed the purchase order, he \nreceived shipping instructions and an import control worksheet from his employer\u2019s \nEX/IM office. The import control worksheet did not include a space to identify the items \nas classified.  Applicant was instructed that the material should be imported on an \u201cATF\u201d \nexemption rather than on a DSP-85 license issued for classified material. (Tr. 28.) The \nimport control worksheet listed the TAA as the document authorizing the import. The \nshipping instructions did not include any handling instructions for classified material. (AE \nB.) \n \n \nAt the request of the EX/IM official assigned the purchase order, on January 6, \n2015, Applicant gave the EX/IM office a separate material classification worksheet for \neach classified part. Those worksheets were required to import the parts from the \n\n5 \n \nforeign supplier. On each worksheet, the classified part was identified as \u201cClassified\u201d as \nto the security classification of the product. The following day, Engineer X advised \nApplicant that their export license compliance manager had said \u201cit is OK to import the \ntwo classified and the other unclassified line items against [the TAA].\u201d (AE B; Tr. 29.) \n \n \nOn January 26, 2015, the foreign supplier notified Applicant and one of \nApplicant\u2019s co-workers (a buyer) that \u201c[a]ll 20 items are marked as classified on their \nindividual boxes and are packed in a crate, which was shipped on Friday.\u201d (AE B.) On \nFebruary 3, 2015, new inventory control worksheets were issued for EX/IM officials, \nwhich again listed the TAA as the import authorization. On February 11, 2015, the \nEX/IM official managing the purchase order advised engineer X and a procurement \nspecialist in Applicant\u2019s office that if the items were to be imported only temporarily and \nthen shipped right back out, they \u201cshould have come in on a DSP61.\u201d (AE B.) \n \n \nThe crate containing both classified and unclassified hardware was sent by \nunsecured means from the foreign supplier to Applicant\u2019s employer. (GE 2; AEs A-B; Tr. \n59.) Approximately one month later, Applicant had no information that the shipment had \ncleared U.S. customs, so he alerted the warehouse about the shipment. He indicated in \nhis email that shipments would soon be in transit to the warehouse, including some \nclassified items; that multiple shipments shipped from the foreign vendor were currently \nin U.S. customs; and that, for the items that are classified, \u201cthey will be identified with a \nlabel on individual boxes inside the crate.\u201d (AE B.) Applicant wanted to ensure that the \nwarehouse was aware of the need to segregate and secure the classified hardware. On \nMarch 3, 2015, Applicant received a status report from the warehouse that did not list \nthe classified shipment. (Tr. 31.) Concerned because the shipment should have been \nreceived by then, Applicant asked the warehouse for proof of the shipment\u2019s delivery. \nThe freight forwarder showed that the shipment was received in the warehouse on \nFebruary 16, 2015. After Applicant provided proof of delivery to the warehouse, the \nshipment was located and the classified material, which was marked as Confidential, \nwas then properly segregated and secured. (GE 2; AEs A-B; Tr. 31-32, 60.) \n \n \nWhen questioned in January 2016 about his role in the security violation, \nengineer X asserted that he was told by the export license compliance manager that he \ncould order classified parts from the foreign supplier under the existing TAA. When the \ncompliance manager was interviewed, she stated that she more likely told him that the \nagreement had a classified component or element, but that he should read the \nagreement and validate it himself, and contact the EX/IM official assigned the matter. \nEngineer X never contacted the EX/IM official on the TAA. As a result of his incorrect \ntranslation of the TAA and his directions to Applicant, the classified parts were not \nproperly shipped. They were vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure for about four days \nwhile in transit and for approximately two weeks while unsecured in the warehouse. \nApplicant was deemed culpable by his employer for failing to ensure that there was a \ncurrent contract security classification specification or Security Aspects Letter with the \nforeign vendor. The foreign vendor held a NATO Secret facility clearance, but the lack \nof proper security classification guidance raised questions about the methods used by \n\n6 \n \nthe foreign vendor for the protection of classified information within its control. \nCompromise was suspected because it could not be ruled out. (GE 2; AE A.) \n \n \nNeither Applicant nor engineer X had any previous security infractions on their \nrecords. For his role in the security violations, Applicant received a two-week unpaid \nsuspension from work, which was consistent with his employer\u2019s published disciplinary \nprocess. He was also ineligible for supplemental compensation (merit pay) from his \nemployer in 2017. Applicant was reeducated on the importance of safeguarding \nclassified information. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 44.) His security violations were reported to the \nDOD on June 3, 2016. (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant immediately set out on March 3, 2016, to establish a procurement \nprocedure to ensure that classified purchase orders would be properly marked. Among \nthe procedures, he established that, on receipt of a classified customer requisition \norder, supply chain management would identify a supply source and then make a DD \n254 determination. Requisitions from the program management office would include in \nthe request the classification for the material. Purchase orders would be required to \nstate \u201cYes\u201d in the header for \u201cClassified Items Exist,\u201d and the buyer would have to note \nin the header that a DD 254 is required, and to add in the text of the purchase order \n\u201cThe PN for this PO is CLASSIFIED. Department of Defense contract security \nclassification specification, DD form 254 has been forwarded under separate cover.\u201d  \n(AEs A, C.) His employer improved its processes to ensure that classified purchase \norders and shipments are executed in compliance with regulations. License \nauthorization authority moved from the program management office to an EX/IM role. All \ncompany technical information/services and material orders are now vetted to \ndetermine whether a U.S. export or import authorization or license is required from the \nU.S. State Department or U.S. Commerce Department. Checks were established to \nensure that new orders are compliant with the authorization. To avoid any ambiguity, for \nthe two systems in his supply chain accountability, Applicant had all the classified \nmaterial listed in the security classification guidance (SCG) for the systems entered into \na material-tracking database against which any new order is matched. If an item is \nflagged in the database, it is treated as classified. (AE A; Tr. 35-37.) His employer also \ninstituted a transportation plan, and Applicant set up a process to track the \ntransportation of any classified material. (Tr. 32-33, 39.) \n \n \nApplicant completed more than 40 hours of security authorization and \nexport/import training after the violations were discovered in 2016. (Tr. 44.) As of May \n2019, he had issued two classified purchase orders and managed or participated in nine \nclassified shipments since the violations. (AE A; Tr. 61.) There is no evidence that he \nfailed to comply with his company\u2019s procedures or NISPOM requirements in those \ninstances. (AE A; Tr. 40.) He sought guidance from his employer\u2019s security staff before \ninitiating any purchase order or equipment. (Tr. 61.) In 2019, Applicant was recognized \nby his employer for his trustworthiness. He has a reputation for always doing the right \nthing for his company and for maintaining open and honest dialog with leadership and \ncustomers. (AE D.) \n \n\n7 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. \nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe security concern for handling protected information is articulated in AG \u00b6 33: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information\u2014which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information\u2014raises \ndoubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or \nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern. \n \n \nApplicant violated the NISPOM in several aspects when he caused classified \nhardware to be shipped as unclassified in February 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The evidence \nshows that, in February 2011, he processed a RSO for a foreign military customer for \nparts that were classified Confidential under the program\u2019s SCG. As a supply chain \nmanager, Applicant lacked technical knowledge about the parts, so he consulted with \nengineer X in the program office, who told him that the parts were not classified unless \nmatched to the frequency data. Together, Applicant and engineer X determined that the \nparts were not classified because they would be shipped in a steady state. NISPOM \u00b6 \n4-103 indicates that classification guidance is the exclusive responsibility of the \ngovernment contracting activity (GCA). Under NISPOM \u00b6 4-104, issues about the \nclassification level are to be discussed with the pertinent GCA. While engineer X may \nhave had some expertise about the parts, Applicant violated his security responsibilities \nby failing to verify the classification level for the parts. \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s direction to handle the shipment as unclassified, the shipping \nagent sent the parts to the foreign military in February 2013 without the markings, \npackaging, and other security protections required of the NISPOM, and on an export \nlicense for unclassified material in violation of ITAR regulations. Under \u00b6 4-200, \nclassified material is to be physically marked at the appropriate level to warn and inform \nholders of the degree of protection required. NISPOM \u00b6 5-400 requires that classified \nmaterial be transmitted in a manner that prevents loss or unauthorized access. NISPOM \n\u00b6 5-401 specifies that classified information be enclosed in opaque inner and outer \ncovers with the inner cover to bear the appropriate classification markings. NISPOM \u00b6 \n5-405 sets forth certain requirements for transmission of classified material to a location \noutside the United States. Applicant\u2019s actions led to hardware classified as Confidential \nin the SCG being vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure for the duration of the shipment. \nCompromise was suspected because it could not be ruled out. \n \n \nApplicant also violated his security responsibilities in June 2014 when he placed \nan order for both classified and unclassified parts with a foreign vendor that lacked the \nproper security agreements for supplying the classified hardware. Applicant relied on \nthe erroneous advice of engineer X, who told him that classified items could be \npurchased from the foreign supplier under the TAA. Applicant did not review the TAA, \n\n9 \n \nwhich stated, in part: \u201cClassified information and material generated under this \nagreement must be assigned a security classification as specified by the separate \ncontract(s) security classification specifications provided with the contract(s).\u201d The TAA \nspecifically authorized the foreign supplier to produce unclassified electromechanical \nparts and assembly components. No DD 254 or Security Aspects Letter existed for the \nproduction of classified hardware by the foreign vendor. As set forth in \u00b6 4-103 of the \nNISPOM, the contract security classification specification (DD 254) is a contractual \nspecification necessary for performance on a classified contract. Applicant knew that \nsome of the items in the order were classified. In early January 2015, before the parts \nwere imported, Applicant gave the EX/IM office the material classification worksheets \nrequired for the import of the parts from the foreign supplier. The worksheets for each \nclassified part indicated \u201cClassified.\u201d While Applicant may have been misled by engineer \nX about the TAA, and he listed on the material classification worksheets that the parts \nwere classified, neither circumstance relieved him of his security obligation to ensure \nthat a security agreement and security classification guidance existed before he placed \nthe order. His violation of this fundamental security requirement led to classified parts \nbeing manufactured by a foreign supplier without adequate security agreements and \nsecurity measures in place; to the shipment of classified parts by unsecured means to \nApplicant\u2019s employer; and to the classified parts not being properly protected or secured \nin his employer\u2019s warehouse for some two weeks. Compromise was suspected because \nit could be ruled out. \n \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 34(g), \u201cany failure to comply with rules for the \nprotection of classified or sensitive information,\u201d and \u00b6 34(h), \u201cnegligence or lax security \npractices that persist despite counseling by management,\u201d apply. Although compromise \nwas suspected in both instances, it was not proven that protected information was \naccessed by anyone without the appropriate clearance level and need-to-know. AG \u00b6 \n34(i), \u201cfailure to comply with rules or regulations that results in damage to the national \nsecurity, regardless of whether it was deliberate or negligent,\u201d is not established. \n \n \nApplicant handled classified information without any problems before the \nincidents at issue. Nevertheless, he has a significant burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by his noncompliance with the rules and regulations for handling \nprotected information. AG \u00b6 35(a) has some applicability because the infractions were \ninfrequent. AG \u00b6 35(a) provides: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nEven so, the seriousness with which his employer considered the violations is \nevident in the discipline imposed. Applicant was suspended without pay for two weeks \nand ineligible for extra (merit) compensation in 2017. \n \n\n10 \n \n \nApplicant has a case for mitigation under AG \u00b6 35(b), \u201cthe individual responded \nfavorably to counseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates a positive \nattitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d Notwithstanding engineer X\u2019s \ntechnical expertise about the classified hardware sent to the foreign military, Applicant \nunderstands his error in not seeking additional guidance and verification before notifying \nthe shipping agent to treat the parts as unclassified. He accepts responsibility for failing \nto verify whether the advice from engineer X was accurate about the TAA allowing the \nprocurement and import of classified hardware from a foreign vendor. He also \nacknowledges that he failed to ensure that there was a current contract security \nclassification specification with the foreign vendor before he placed the order for \nclassified parts. He completed more than 40 hours of security and export/import control \ntraining after the violations were discovered. He immediately began taking remedial \nmeasures by creating a procurement procedure for classified material. Applicant\u2019s \nemployer, with some assistance from Applicant, established and implemented \nprocesses to ensure that all technical information and material orders are vetted for the \nproper export/import license or authorization; that classified material is properly \nidentified under the SCG and then handled appropriately (documented in compliance \nwith EX/IM requirements, packaged, inspected, stored, and transported); that classified \nshipments are tracked; and that classified purchase orders are properly marked and \nidentified. Applicant\u2019s unrebutted testimony is that he has issued two classified \npurchase orders and managed or participated in nine classified shipments since the \nviolations with no problems. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 35(c), \u201cthe security violations were due to improper or inadequate training \nor unclear instructions,\u201d warrants some consideration. Engineer X was culpable in \nadvising Applicant that the hardware to be exported to the foreign military became \nclassified only when matched to the frequency data and that the TAA with the foreign \nvendor permitted the requisition of both classified and unclassified hardware. As a \nsupply chain manager, Applicant would not have had the same level of technical \nunderstanding of the program hardware as engineer X, who had experience as a parts \ninspector and, as an \u201cauthorization owner,\u201d was the point person for ITAR requirements; \ninitiated EX/IM licenses and TAA requests; and was liaison with EX/IM officials. EX/IM \nofficials knew or should have known that the TAA was being relied on for the import of \nclassified items from the foreign supplier because the TAA was listed as authorization \nfor the import of the classified parts. Even so, Applicant can reasonably be faulted for \nnot ensuring that a foreign supplier was authorized to manufacture or supply classified \ncomponents for such a sensitive military system before he placed the order. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 35(d), \u201cthe violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern,\u201d has some applicability. \nApplicant should have questioned engineer X\u2019s assessment that the hardware subject \nto the February 2011 RSO was not classified in a steady state. However, it was not \nshown that he deliberately chose to circumvent security requirements for shipping \nclassified hardware. Applicant\u2019s behavior with regard to the June 2014 purchase order \nfor classified and non-classified items from the foreign vendor shows that he attempted \nto ensure that security procedures were followed for handling and shipping classified \n\n11 \n \ninformation. Available documentation shows that Applicant identified the classified parts \nin the text of the purchase order submitted to the foreign vendor. He identified the parts \nas classified on material classification worksheets. He alerted EX/IM officials about the \nclassified nature of the hardware to be supplied by the foreign vendor. When the \nwarehouse had no record of receiving the shipment containing the classified items, \nApplicant requested a proof of delivery from the freight provider, which showed that the \nitems were in the warehouse. AG \u00b6 35(d) does not fully apply, however. Applicant may \nnot have fully understood at the time that the hardware sent to the foreign military in \nFebruary 2013 was in fact classified, or that the TAA with the foreign supplier in June \n2014 required a security agreement for classified parts. He knew in March 2015 that the \ncrate containing both classified and unclassified items had been in his employer\u2019s \nwarehouse for approximately two weeks without the classified items being properly \nsegregated and secured. There is no evidence that he alerted his security office about \nthe security violation. Instead, it was discovered approximately one year later, during a \nfive-year review for ITAR violations by his employer. As a longtime employee with a \nsecurity clearance, Applicant can be expected to have known to report security issues \nthat came to his attention, even if his experience handling classified information was \nlimited. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guideline K, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Although it does not excuse Applicant\u2019s role in the \ntwo security violations, his culpability is minimized somewhat because he relied in good \nfaith on the advice of a lead engineer, who had some technical knowledge of the \nprogram as program engineering manager and had authority for requesting TAAs and \nexport/import licenses. Applicant was motivated to perform his duties as supply chain \nmanager properly. He understands now that he should have taken a more active role in \nensuring he was complying with security procedures.  \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the \n\n12 \n \nDirective. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not designed to \npunish applicants for past mistakes or shortcomings. He presented evidence of the \nprocedures instituted by him and his employer to ensure a culture of security \ncompliance at the company. His employer entrusted him with classified information \nsince the violations, and there is no evidence that he failed to comply in any regard with \nsecurity practices and procedures. While his role in the security violations is not \ncondoned, after considering all the facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 22, 2015. \nHe was interviewed by a government investigator on May 2, 2017, and responded to \ninterrogatories on June 27, 2018. After reviewing the information gathered during the \nbackground investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) on August 13, 2018, alleging security concerns under Guideline F \n(financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR on September 21, 2018, and \nrequested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), containing the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter dated \nJanuary 8, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on January 17, 2019. He was granted a \nperiod of 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any objections to the FORM and \n\n \n2 \n \n \nto provide material to refute, extenuate, and mitigate the concerns. Applicant did not \nrespond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on April 12, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that the FORM included an \nunauthenticated summary of interview with a government background investigator on \nMay 2, 2017. (FORM, Item 4) Applicant was informed he could object to the summary \nof his interview, and it would not be admitted or considered, or that he could make \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and update the document to make it accurate. \nApplicant was informed that his failure to respond to the FORM or to raise any \nobjections could be construed as a waiver and the proposed FORM evidence would be \nconsidered. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. I admitted the FORM\u2019s proffered \nevidence and considered it. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted SOR financial allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, \nand 1.g. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f, by stating that he was unaware of these \naccounts. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is 30 years old. He graduated from high school in 2007, and completed \nsome college courses between 2007 and 2009, but did not earn a degree. He has never \nbeen married, but has a son, four years old.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows that he was unemployed between August \n2007 and March 2010. He worked for a federal contractor between March 2010 and \nSeptember 2013. He was unemployed between October 2013 and October 2014, and \nemployed between October 2014 and October 2015. A federal contractor hired \nApplicant as a mail truck driver in October 2015, and is sponsoring his clearance. This \nis Applicant\u2019s first SCA.  \n \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2015 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed he had financial problems caused by periods of employment and lack of \nfinancial backing. He disclosed delinquent student loans and a delinquent television \nservices account. He promised to establish payment arrangements with both creditors \nas soon as possible. \n \nDuring his 2017 interview with a government investigator, Applicant was \nquestioned about most of the accounts alleged in the SOR. He explained that \nunemployment and low earnings prevented him from paying his debts. He volunteered \nthat he had a judgment filed against him and his bank account was levied. He failed to \nfile his 2013 income tax returns and had to file them before filing income tax returns for \n2015 and 2016. He claimed he immediately paid whatever taxes he owed. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nConcerning his student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e), Applicant claimed he had \nconsolidated his student loans, established a payment plan, and was making his \npayments. He stated that he acquired the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b in 2013, when \nhe was unemployed and could not make the payments. He claimed that he established \na payment agreement with the creditor and paid the account in 2014. Applicant claimed \nthe medical account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was paid by his insurance company. SOR \u00b6 \n1.g alleges the same delinquent television services account Applicant disclosed in his \n2015 SCA, which is in collection by a collection agency. Applicant failed to present \ndocumentary evidence to support any of the above claims. \n \nIn his responses to the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility interrogatories, \ndated June 27, 2018, Applicant stated that he had failed to obtain the IRS account \ntranscripts that he was asked to provide for tax years 2013 through 2017, and failed to \nprovide documentation showing the he had filed his state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2013 through 2017. Applicant claimed that he had filed his federal and state \nincome tax returns for the years in question. He failed to present documentary evidence \nto substantiate his claims. Concerning the delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.g, Applicant answered that he had not paid or made payment arrangements \nregarding his delinquent accounts. \n \nApplicant lives at home with his parents. As of his June 2018 answer to \ninterrogatories, his gross monthly income was $2,692. After paying his deductions and \nmonthly expenses (including $980 in car expenses and $600 child support obligation), \nApplicant has an $11 monthly net remainder. He did not present evidence to show that \nhe has a working budget or that he has participated in financial counseling. \n \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of any contacts with creditors, \npayments made, or payment agreements established concerning any of the SOR debts. \nHe promised to address the SOR debts sometime in the near future.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n5 \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. The delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR are established by the record evidence. He was unemployed \nbetween August 2007 and March 2010, and between October 2013 and October 2014. \nHe has been fully employed with federal contractors since March 2010, except for the \nperiod between October 2013 and October 2014. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying \nconditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) \ninability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The \nrecord established these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nI considered the seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20; however, only one is potentially applicable: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nThe AG \u00b6 20(b) financial considerations mitigating condition is not fully raised by \nthe facts in this case and does not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems started before 2015, and are ongoing and unresolved. Applicant\u2019s evidence is \ninsufficient to establish that circumstances beyond his control contributed to his financial \nproblems. Even if they were, he failed to establish that he has been financially \nresponsible under the circumstances. He did not present sufficient evidence of good-\nfaith efforts to pay his debts; that he has been in contact with his creditors, of any \n\n \n6 \n \n \npayments made since he acquired the debts, of any payment agreements, disputed \ndebts, or of efforts to otherwise resolve his delinquencies.  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to \ndemonstrate financial responsibility or that his financial problems are being resolved. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment: \n \nApplicant, 30, has been employed with federal contractors since 2010, except for \na one-year period between October 2013 and October 2014. This is his first SCA. His \nevidence is insufficient to establish a track record of financial responsibility. It is well \nsettled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.

The record in this case \nclosed 11 April 2019, when Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due. Applicant \nsubmitted no additional documents. DOHA assigned the case to me 7 May 2019. \n1Consisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-9. \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective 8 June 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted failing to timely file his 2011-2013 Federal income tax returns, \nand his 2009, 2011, and 2012 state income tax returns, and accumulating almost \n$10,000 delinquent debt (SOR 1.a-1.d); he claimed to have brought his delinquent \nmortgage current (SOR 1.e). He is a 61-year-old flight mechanic employed by a U.S. \ndefense contractor since August 2003. He seeks to renew a security clearance first \nissued in June 2000, and reissued in April 2004 (Item 2). \nApplicant disclosed his failure to file his 2010-2013 Federal income tax returns on \nhis March 2016 clearance application (Item 2), and discussed those returns, as well as \nhis 2014-2015 returns, and eight delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR, during his \nAugust 2017 interview with a Government investigator (Item 3), based on his June \n2016 credit report (Item 7). He attributed his failure to file his Federal income tax returns \nto having to care for his ill mother. His Answer to the SOR (Answer) also recounts six \nsignificant surgeries\u2014most work related\u2014between January 2011 and July 2018. Each \nof these surgeries incurred significant, largely unpaid, time off from work. \nApplicant\u2019s 29 October 2018 response to DOHA interrogatories (Item 4) stated \nthat he had now filed his 2009-2012 state and Federal income tax returns He provided \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) account transcripts for 2009-2017, but has not provided \nany state documentation. His account transcripts showed that his 2009-2010 tax returns \nwere timely filed, his 2011-2012 returns were each filed three years late, his 2013 return \nhad not been filed as of February 2017, and his 2014-2017 returns were filed late, albeit \nwithin periods ranging from two weeks to two months after they were due. Several of \nthese returns resulted in refunds which were seized to satisfy taxes due for earlier tax \nyears. \nApplicant\u2019s February 2019 Answer (Item 1) stated, without corroboration, that he \nhad paid the past-due amount on his mortgage (SOR 1.e) in full. He provided no \nevidence of a resolution for SOR debt 1.d. \nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a \nbudget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community \ninvolvement. He submitted no current credit reports which might have corroborated his \nclaimed payments. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability \nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, \nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s multiple surgeries and \ntime off from work explain why he fell delinquent on various credit accounts, including \nthose alleged in the SOR. However, these financial pressures do not explain his failures \nto timely file his state and Federal income tax returns. Applicant failed to timely file his \n2011-2013 Federal income tax returns and his 2009 and 2011-2012 state income tax \nreturns. He has stated no credible reason for his failures, and while his IRS tax \ntranscripts chronicle his 2009-2017 tax filings, he did not otherwise corroborate any \nefforts to reach any repayment agreement other than having future tax refunds seized. \nMoreover, his 2013 Federal income tax return has still not been filed, and he did not \ndocument the filing of his state income tax returns. Finally, he did not document his \nclaimed catch-up payments on his delinquent mortgage, and provided no information on \nhis single largest debt.4 \nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access \nto classified information. Indeed, the Board has previously \n3See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n4\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a history \nof not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnoted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their \nlegal obligation to file income tax returns may be said not to \nhave demonstrated the high degree of judgment and \nreliability required for access to classified information.\u201d5 \nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful6 or attributed to the press of other \ncircumstances.7 As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of \nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal \nor state income tax returns for 10 years. \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal \nobligation. Applicant\u2019s . . . failure to have done so for many \nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling \nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that \ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A \nperson who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 \n(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the \nJudge noted, Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 19(g) explicitly \nprovides that failure to file tax returns is a circumstance that \ncan raise a security concern. Moreover, the Directive \npresumes a nexus between admitted or proven conduct \nunder any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nclearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 9, 2015). \nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an \nApplicant is financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case \nhis failure to timely file his Federal returns for at least eight years has created significant \ntax debt that he has not addressed. \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His \nfailures to timely file his Federal returns are multiple, recent, and the circumstances are \n5ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge\u2019s favorable decision. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years). \n6See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester). \n7See, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file). \n4 \n\n                                              \nnot demonstrated to be unlikely to recur.8  Moreover, he has not demonstrated that his \nfailures to timely file and his subsequent failures to timely pay or make pay \narrangements were due to circumstances beyond his control, and it is clear that he has \nnot been responsible in addressing his taxes.9  Similarly, while his delinquent debts are \narguably due to his medical issues, they are all recent and are either not addressed at \nall, or not documented, and thus cannot be considered to have been responsibly \naddressed. \nApplicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, and he has not \ndocumented that the debts are being resolved.10  The absence of documentation means \nApplicant cannot demonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve his \ndebts. 11  The missing details of his current tax status requires the same conclusion \nregarding his taxes. 12  Moreover, he submitted no work or character evidence which \nmight support a whole-person assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by \nhis conduct. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\n Formal Findings \nParagraph 1.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 4, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on November \n14, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on November 14, 2018, scheduling the hearing for December 4, 2018. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through \n6, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and called \nthree witnesses, his wife, his father, and his brother. Applicant presented seven \ndocuments, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through G, which were \n\n \n2 \n \nadmitted into evidence. The record was left open until February 4, 2019, for receipt of \nadditional documentation. On February 4, 2019, Applicant offered one additional \ndocument, which was marked as AppX H and admitted into evidence. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (TR) on December 13, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the two allegations of the SOR, \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., and 1.b. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 10.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since August of 2014. \n(AppX 1 at page 10.) He is married, and has three adult children. (GX 1 at pages 21, \nand 24~25.) Applicant attributes his alleged financial difficulties to the crash of the \nhousing market in 2008, and to a year of unemployment prior to his present \nemployment. (TR at page 25 line 25 to page 29 at line 13, and GX 1 at page 11.)  \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a Applicant admits a past-due debt for landscaping to Creditor A in the amount \nof about $33,000. (TR at page 62 line 23 to page 64 line 12.) He has settled this debt for \n$15,000, and has made the first of three $5,000 payments as evidenced by \ndocumentation from Creditor A. (AppX H.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admits a past-due debt as the result of a foreclosure to Creditor B. \n(TR at 66 line 3 to page 68 line 12.) This debt was satisfied more than six years ago \nthrough the foreclosure, as evidenced by the Government\u2019s July 2012 credit report. (GX \n4 at page 4.)  This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife corroborated his testimony, and his father and brother testified \nas to Applicant\u2019s good character. (TR at page 40 line 15 to page 49 line 6, at page 78 \nline 6 to page 80 line 19, and at page 82 line 3 to page 84 line 5.) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \n\n \n3 \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n\n \n4 \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant had a foreclosure and a significant past-due landscaping debt. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems have been addressed. His foreclosure was \nsatisfied years ago, and he his addressing his landscaping debt through agreed \nsettlement payments. Applicant has thus demonstrated that future financial problems \nare unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n5 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines B and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines implemented on June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \n \nApplicant answered (Ans.) the SOR on February 14, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On April 18, 2019, the case was assigned to \n\n \n2 \n \n \nme. On May 15, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for June 4, 2019. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and request for administrative notice were \nmarked as hearing exhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified and offered exhibit (AE) A, \nwhich was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 13, \n2019. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Iraq. Department Counsel \nprovided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide context for the requested \nfacts. The specific facts noticed are included in the Findings of Fact. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from U.S. Government reports. (See \nISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, \n2004) and McLeod v.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1962. He graduated from high \nschool and completed three years of college in Iraq. He immigrated to the United States \nin 2007. He became a U.S. citizen in 2012. He is employed in the private sector, but is \npursuing a linguist position with a federal contractor, for which he is seeking a security \nclearance. He has been married for 26 years and has three children. His wife and \nchildren are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. 24, 39, 44; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Lebanon and resident of \nIraq and that two brothers are residents and citizens of Iraq. The SOR further alleged \nthat Applicant provided financial support to one brother and his mother in Iraq; that he \nshares ownership of a home in Iraq with his siblings; and that he maintained a bank \naccount in Iraq. The SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to disclose his Iraqi bank \naccount during an official security screening interview on May 11, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant was hired locally as a linguist from 2005 to 2007 for U.S. forces in Iraq. \nHe provided linguist services supporting the mission of training Iraqi police officers. He \nworked in hostile areas requiring him to wear a helmet and body armor, and carry a \n\n \n3 \n \n \nweapon. In 2007, he and his family immigrated to the United States using a special \nimmigrant visa based upon his work with U.S. forces. In 2008, he was hired by a \ngovernment contractor to fulfill a linguist position in Iraq. He served in various linguist \npositions. He worked for both U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army units during this time. \nOnce again, he was consistently exposed to hostile areas while performing his duties. In \n2011, with the drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq, Applicant was laid off from his position \nand returned to the United States. (Tr. 22-24, 31-32, 43-44; GE 1, 3-4) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from 2011 to 2014. He supported his family with \nsavings and his wife\u2019s and children\u2019s employment. In 2014, he began working in the \nprivate sector in the transportation field. Applicant has never traveled back to Iraq for \nany personal reasons and has no intent to do so in the future. After he gained his \ncitizenship in 2012, he sought a position as a linguist, which required a security \nclearance. (Tr. 24, 40; GE 4) \n \n \nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows: \n \n \n1. Applicant\u2019s mother (M). M is 78 years old. She remains a Lebanese citizen and \nresident of Iraq. She is a housewife and lives in the home she inherited from her \nhusband. She receives a small pension. She has no connection to the Iraqi government. \nApplicant sent his mother approximately $1,000 in 2008 or 2009, after his father died. \nHe has not sent her any other funds. Applicant has weekly contact with her using an \nInternet phone application. He loves his mother, but his most important family members \nare his wife and three children. (Tr. 26, 41-42, 46-47; GE 4) \n \n \n2. Applicant\u2019s two brothers (B1-B2).  Applicant has a third brother who is a citizen \nand resident of the United States. B1 is a resident alien of Canada, although he \ncurrently retains his Iraqi citizenship. His family resides in Canada. He works in the \nconstruction industry. Applicant previously had weekly contact with B1, but recently their \ncontact is infrequent because of a dispute among the brothers about the home they \ninherited from their father (the home where their mother currently lives). B2 is a resident \nand citizen of Iraq. B2 is self-employed. Applicant previously had monthly contact with \nB2, but because of the property conflict, he now has sporadic contact with him. Neither \nB1 nor B2 have any ties to the Iraqi government. He does not have a good relationship \nwith B1 and B2. (Tr. 27-28, 42; Ans.; GE 4) \n \n \n Applicant loaned B2 $5,000, which is being repaid. The current debt is \napproximately $3,500. Applicant inherited a 20 percent interest in his father\u2019s home. \nApplicant\u2019s share of the home could be worth as much as $100,000. He is willing to \nforego any interest in this home. He has tried to persuade his brothers into selling the \nproperty, but they refuse to do so. Applicant owns a home in the United States where \nhis family lives. He has over $100,000 worth of equity in the home. He estimated that \nhis net worth in this country is $300,000. In approximately 1979, Applicant opened a \nbank account in Iraq. With the wars and inflation over the years, the account lost value \nresulting in a de minimis amount and Applicant believed the account was closed in the \n\n \n4 \n \n \n1990s for not meeting the minimum balance requirement. (Tr. 26, 29-30, 35-37; Ans.; \nGE 4) \n \n \nIn May 2017, Applicant completed a security screening questionnaire. One of the \nquestioned asked whether he had any foreign bank accounts and he answered \u201cno.\u201d \nApplicant completed a similar screening questionnaire in 2008 and disclosed that he \nhad a bank account in Iraq. He explained the circumstances of this account when he \nwas interviewed later in May 2017 by a defense investigator. Applicant credibly testified \nthat he had no intent to deceive in 2017, and he believed the account had minimal funds \nand had been closed. (Tr. 30, 37; Ans.; GE 3-5) \n \nCharacter Evidence. \n \n \nApplicant supplied character references from two military supervisors associated \nwith his linguist duties from 2008 to 2011. Those supervisors noted that his linguistic \nskills and other positive character traits, such as honesty and being a team player, \nmade him a valuable asset. Applicant was also recognized by receiving four certificates \nof appreciation and two training certificates. (AE A) \n \nAdministrative Notice. \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq as travel \nwithin the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at \nhigh risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel to Iraq. The \nU.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to \nbe serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. The \nIslamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, \nmaintaining a formidable force in Iraq and Syria. (HE II) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nrelationship between Iraq and the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith his relatives and friends living in Iraq does not pose a security risk. Applicant \nshould not be placed in a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty \nto the United States and a desire to assist his relatives and friends living in Iraq who \nmight be coerced by governmental entities, or pressured to assist Iraq.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004)) \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Iraq seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant, his relatives, or his \nfriends living in Iraq, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n\n \n7 \n \n \n7(a) and 7(b) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s family members who are residents and \ncitizens of Iraq. AG \u00b6 7(f) applies because of Applicant\u2019s interest in the family home in \nIraq that he acquired from an inheritance. Applicant\u2019s Iraqi bank account is of nominal \nvalue and not a security concern. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and    \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he has limited contact with his relatives in Iraq. He \npresented sufficient evidence to establish that it is unlikely that he would be placed in a \nposition to choose between the interest of his relatives living in Iraq and those of the \nUnited States. He already has demonstrated that he would put the United States\u2019 \ninterests first when he worked as a linguist from 2005 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2011, \nwhile his family members were living in Iraq. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \nApplicant has met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He worked as a linguist from 2005 to 2007 and \nagain from 2008 to 2011, performing different missions for U.S. forces where he earned \npraise for his service while in harm\u2019s way. He became a U.S. citizen in 2012. He \ncurrently works and lives in the United States with his wife and three children. They own \nproperty in this country and have other substantial assets here. The evidence supports \nthat Applicant has longstanding ties to the United States and would resolve any conflict \nof interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial interests in this country are much more substantial than his \ninterests in Iraq. He has no intention of claiming his interest in the property, unless it is \nsold and the proceeds distributed among all the heirs. However, his brothers are not \namenable to a sale. AG \u00b6 8(f) applies. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \nApplicant provided information about his Iraqi bank account in 2008. When he \nwas asked about it again in May 2017 he did not think of it as an active account, which \nis why he neglected to list it on the form. He credibly testified that he had no intent to \ndeceive by failing to disclose this information. Additionally, since the account has a de \nminimis balance, it does not present a material security concern. AG \u00b6 16(a) has not \nbeen established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing \ntowards denying his clearance. I considered the comments by Applicant\u2019s U.S. military \nsupervisors, who attested to his dedication and commitment to U.S. forces. I also \nconsidered his strong ties to this country as a linguist serving in harm\u2019s way while \nassisting U.S forces. He has demonstrated his longstanding loyalty to the United States. \nTherefore, he provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence, were \nmitigated and that no disqualifying conditions were established under Guideline E.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs     1.a: - 1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph       2.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

Karoian, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant \nmitigated \nthe \ntrustworthiness \nconcerns \nregarding \nfinancial \nconsiderations. Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 18, 2016, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On September 7, \n2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \n04/26/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nto grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract \nwith the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case \nfile. In a sworn statement, dated October 26, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on December 20, 2018, and she was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as \nwell as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM \non January 15, 2019. Applicant\u2019s response was originally due within 30 days of the receipt \nof the FORM, but she was granted a 30-day extension. Applicant responded to the FORM \nby submitting a statement and associated documents on March 4, 2019, all of which were \naccepted without objection. The case was assigned to me on April 16, 2019.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted (by using the term \u201cI accept\u201d) all of \nthe factual allegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.m.). Attached to her Answer to \nthe SOR were a number of documents and comments in support of her individual \nresponses. Applicant\u2019s admissions, comments, and the information in the attachments \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a U.S. Naval hospital located overseas. \nShe has been serving as a medical assistant with her current employer since August \n2016, and previously served as a volunteer in the same facility from January 2016 until \nAugust 2016. Before that, she was a certified nursing assistant for a domestic healthcare \nprovider for several years commencing in 2006. A 2006 high school graduate, she \nreceived an associate\u2019s degree as an x-ray medical technician and medical assistant in \n2011. Applicant has never served with the U.S. military. She has never held a security \nclearance, and it is unclear if she ever held a position of public trust. Applicant was \nmarried in 2008. She has two children, born in 2008 and 2009. \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties first arose, although a review of \nher March 2016 credit report seems to indicate that some accounts became delinquent \nas early as 2013. In her e-QIP, Applicant reported that she was employed as a certified \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated May 1, 2018); Item 5 (Combined Experian, \nTransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated March 3, 2016); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 3, \n2018; and Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated October 26, 2018).  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nnursing assistant from June 2006 until at least February 2016,2 but during an interview \nwith an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in May 2018, \nshe stated that she was unemployed from April 2015 until January 2016 when she was \nmoving with her family overseas, house-hunting, job-hunting, and unpacking.3 In her e-\nQIP, she denied having any financial delinquencies within the past seven years, but \nduring her OPM interview, she acknowledged and discussed a number of delinquent \naccounts. With the exception of one credit-card account for which she was an authorized \nuser, and on which her husband failed to make payments while he was deployed to \nAfghanistan, Applicant did not identify any factors that were largely beyond her control \nthat might have resulted in her financial problems. \n  \nThe SOR alleged 13 purportedly continuing delinquent debts, including nine \nstudent loans and four commercial accounts or credit-card accounts, totaling \napproximately $52,549 that had been placed for collection, as follows:  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.f. through 1.j., and 1.m.): These are student loans with \nunpaid balances of $9,635; $7,805; $5,499; $4,491; $4,358; $4,201; $2,208; $1,981; and \n$460 that were placed for collection as reflected in her July 2018 credit report. However, \nApplicant contends that there are only three student loans which are mentioned multiple \ntimes, each time with a different balance. The account numbers in the 2016 credit report \nare all different 20-digit numbers, but the three different account numbers (or partial \naccount numbers) in the 2018 credit report are all 4-digit numbers, none of which have \nany commonality with the longer numbers. Applicant acknowledged that her wages were \nbeing garnished to pay her student loans, and every few months her entire paycheck is \ntaken.4 Attached to her October 2018 Answer to the SOR, as well as her March 2019 \nResponse to the FORM, Applicant submitted documentation reflecting that the U.S. \nDepartment of the Treasury, Bureau of Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) was offsetting her \nwages under the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) to the U.S. Department of Education.5 \nThe earliest wage offset occurred in January 2017 \u2013 18 months before the SOR was \nissued \u2013 with a payment of $1,178.6 Thereafter, there are a number of vouchers and \nstatements reflecting continuing payments through March 2019, totaling well over \n$14,000.7 The accounts, regardless of the actual number, are in the process of being \nresolved. \n                                                          \n2 Item 3 (e-QIP, dated February 18, 2016), at 13. \n \n3 Item 6, supra note 1, at 3. \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, dated March 4, 2019. \n \n5 The TOP is a centralized offset program, administered by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's Debt \nManagement Services (DMS), to collect delinquent debts owed to federal agencies and states (including \npast-due child support), in accordance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(d) (collection of debts owed to federal \nagencies), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720A (reduction of tax refund by amount of the debts), and other applicable laws. \nSee https://fiscal.treasury.gov/top/how-top-works.html \n \n6 Detail Report, dated January 10, 2017, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM. \n \n7 Item 2 (Detail Reports, various dates), attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR; Item 2 (Fiscal \nService Statements, various dates), attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR; Detail Reports, various \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c.): This is a joint installment-sales contract with an unpaid balance of \n$5,717 that was placed for collection after the last payment was made in 2013, and the \ncreditor was unable to locate the consumer. In August 2018, the creditor accepted \nApplicant\u2019s proposed payment plan under which she agreed to start making monthly \npayments of $200, commencing on September 1, 2018.8 Applicant contends she has \nbeen making the agreed-upon payments and that, as of March 2019, she has a balance \nof $4,785.9 She failed to submit any documents such as receipts, cancelled checks, or \nbank account registers to confirm that those payments were actually being made. In the \nabsence of such documentation, it is unclear if the account is in the process of being \nresolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e.): This is a credit-card account in her husband\u2019s name, for which \nApplicant is only an authorized user,10 with an unpaid balance of either $5,023 (as \nreflected in the 2016 credit report and in the SOR) or $4,973 (as reflected in the 2018 \ncredit report) that was placed for collection and charged off. Applicant contended that the \ncreditor agreed to write off the balance, and that forgiven balance was included in her \nU.S. Individual Income Tax Return for 2016 as other income.11 Applicant submitted that \nincome tax return which reflects that a credit card in the amount of $4,974 is listed as \nother income. The account has been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.k.): This is an individual credit-card account issued by a particular bank \nwith an unpaid balance of $638 that was placed for collection. In her Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant contended that the account had been paid, and she submitted an account \nstatement from the collection agent. However, that account statement refers to an entirely \ndifferent account for the following reasons: the account is an account in her husband\u2019s \nname, not Applicant\u2019s; the account number differs from the one alleged in the SOR; the \nissuing banks are different; and the balances in question are different.12 As Applicant \nfailed to address the account alleged in the SOR, that account has not been resolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.l.): This is an individual unspecified type of account issued by a bank \nwith an unpaid balance of $533 that was placed for collection and transferred or sold to \n                                                          \ndates, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM; Fiscal Service Statements, various dates, attached \nto Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM. \n \n8 Item 2 (e-mail, dated August 9, 2018). \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, supra note 4. \n \n10 Being an authorized user means an individual can use someone else's credit card in the \nindividual\u2019s name. That individual can make purchases and use the card as if it were his or her own, but \nthe individual is not the primary account holder. As an authorized user, the individual may not be legally \nresponsible to pay the credit card bill or any debts that build up. \n \n11 U.S. Individual Income Tax Return for 2016, undated, attached to both Applicant\u2019s Answer to the \nSOR and Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM. \n \n12 Account Statement, dated July 22, 2018, attached to both Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR and \nApplicant\u2019s Response to the FORM. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nanother company after Applicant stopped making payments in 2012. Applicant stated in \nher Response to the FORM that she was \u201ccurrently working on getting my debt paid,\u201d13 \nbut she failed to say what steps she had actually taken to resolve the account and did not \nsubmit any documentation regarding same. The account has not been resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s joint family adjusted gross income for the tax year 2016 was $47,866.14 \nAlthough Applicant referred to a weekly $1,280 paycheck, there is no Personal Financial \nStatement to reflect her current net monthly income, monthly expenses, or any remainder \navailable for discretionary use or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no \nevidence of financial counseling. However, while there is a dearth of financial information, \nin the absence of any additional delinquent accounts, it appears that Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation is now under control.  \nWork Performance and Character References \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, a Navy lieutenant and the head of the substance abuse \nrehabilitation department of the military hospital overseas, characterized Applicant as \nconsistently performing in a professional manner, demonstrating high reliability, and being \nproficient with her assigned duties. Applicant has freely discussed her financial problems \nwith her.15 A more senior officer on the hospital staff referred to Applicant\u2019s consistent \nperformance, reliability, and professionalism, with no evidence to question her character \nor reliability.16 The assistant station manager of the American Red Cross identified \nApplicant as a volunteer. She has a good attendance record, is reliable, responsible, and \nhas the enthusiasm and professionalism to be an asset in the healthcare environment.17 \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d18 As Commander in Chief, the President \nhas the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained \nin the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.19  \n                                                          \n13 Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, supra note 4. \n \n14 U.S. Individual Income Tax Return for 2016, supra note 11. \n \n15 Character Reference, dated February 25, 2019, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM. \n \n16 Character Reference, dated February 25, 2019, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM. \n \n17 Character Reference, dated June 13, 2016, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM. \n \n18 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n19 It should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nCounterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, \ncovers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d20 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.21  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.22 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \n                                                          \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for \ntrustworthiness determinations. \n \n20 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n21 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n22 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b619:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has had a long-standing problem with her finances, stretching back to \n2013. As a result, various accounts, including student loans, and commercial accounts or \ncredit-card accounts, totaling approximately $52,549, became delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) have been established, but AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;23 \n                                                          \n23 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.24  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies, and AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) minimally apply, but AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties make it difficult to conclude that it \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it is \u201cunlikely to \nrecur.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial problems started in 2013 and have continued through today. \nShe was unemployed from April 2015 until January 2016 when she was moving with her \nfamily overseas, house-hunting, job-hunting, and unpacking. Applicant did not identify \nany factors that were largely beyond her control that might have resulted in her financial \nproblems. In January 2017 \u2013 18 months before the SOR was issued \u2013 she entered into \nthe TOP program and started having her wages offset, sometimes her entire weekly \nwage, to the U.S. Department of Education. She has submitted documentation that \nsupports her contentions that, as of March 2019, her payments towards her delinquent \nstudent loans totaled well over $14,000. In addition, she (and her husband) have \naddressed other delinquent accounts listed in the SOR, and in one case, they resolved \nan account for which Applicant had no legal responsibility.  \n \n                                                          \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n24 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her eligibility for a public trust position is in jeopardy may be \nlacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or \nwhen there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests.25 However, while Applicant \nhas not yet addressed two of the SOR-related accounts, in this instance because she \naddressed two accounts belonging to her husband, and two accounts are in a queue \nawaiting resolution efforts, Applicant\u2019s overall resolution efforts commenced well before \nshe was formally notified that her finances could cause her eligibility for a public trust \nposition to be in jeopardy. \nAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s joint family adjusted gross income for the tax year \n2016 was $47,866, including the amount of her forgiven credit-card balance. Although \nApplicant referred to a weekly $1,280 paycheck, there is no Personal Financial Statement \nto reflect her current net monthly income, monthly expenses, or any remainder available \nfor discretionary use or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence \nof financial counseling. However, while there is a dearth of financial information, in the \nabsence of any additional delinquent accounts, it appears that Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation is now under control.  \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, especially after a multi-year delay in taking any action, without further confirmed \naction, are insufficient. In this instance, however, Applicant\u2019s delays transitioned into \npositive action, and she now has a history of fulfilling her financial obligations. Applicant\u2019s \nactions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.26 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n                                                          \n25 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n26 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.27  \n  \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant failed to \nmaintain several accounts, including student loans, and commercial accounts or credit-\ncard accounts, in a current status and a number of them became delinquent. Accounts \ntotaling approximately $52,549 were placed for collection or charged off. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a U.S. Naval hospital located overseas. She has \nbeen serving as a medical assistant with her current employer since August 2016, and \npreviously served as a volunteer in the same facility from January 2016 until August 2016. \nBefore that, she was a certified nursing assistant for a domestic healthcare provider for \nseveral years commencing in 2006. A 2006 high school graduate, she received an \nassociate\u2019s degree as an x-ray medical technician and medical assistant in 2011. She is \nconsidered by her superiors and colleagues to be a good worker, consistently \ndemonstrating high reliability, responsibility, enthusiasm, professionalism, and being \nproficient with her assigned duties. In January 2017 \u2013 18 months before the SOR was \nissued \u2013 she entered into the TOP program and started having her wages offset, \nsometimes her entire weekly wage, to the U.S. Department of Education. She has already \nmade well over $14,000 in payments towards her delinquent student loans, and  she (and \nher husband) have addressed other delinquent accounts listed in the SOR, and in one \ncase, they resolved an account for which Applicant had no legal responsibility. In the \nabsence of any additional delinquent accounts, it appears that Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation is now under control.  \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:28 \n                                                          \n27 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n28 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a fair-to-good track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, resolving, or in the process of resolving most of her debts. Overall, the \nevidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial considerations. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m.: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of public \ntrust to support a contract with the DOD.  Eligibility is granted. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 28, 2016. On \nFebruary 23, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 15, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 30, 2019, \n\n \n2 \n \nand the case was assigned to me on the same day. Applicant requested that his \nhearing be expedited and held while he was in the United States on leave from an \noverseas worksite.  \n \nOn May 3, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on \nMay 7, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant waived the 15-day notice \nrequirement of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 13 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s letter transmitting copies \nof the government\u2019s documentary evidenced is attached to the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HX) I. Applicant testified but did not submit the testimony of any other witnesses \nor any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until May 22, 2019, to enable him \nto submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \nthrough E, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments \nabout AX A through E are attached to the record as HX II. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on May 29, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, 1.n, 1.o, and 2.a-\n2.e. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f, and 1.h-1.m. His admissions in his answer and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old waterfront manager employed by a defense contractor \nsince July 1, 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from August 1984 to \nSeptember 1999. He was self-employed and owned a mortgage company from October \n2002 to December 2007. He sold the business and was unemployed from December \n2007 to June 2008. He worked in various jobs as a consultant or project manager at \nnon-government shipyards from June 2008 to October 2012. He was a federal civilian \nemployee from October 2012 to September 2013. He applied for a security clearance in \nNovember 2012, but his application was denied in December 2013. \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance was denied, he worked in \nnon-government shipyards from October 2013 and as a truck driver from March 2015 to \nJune 2016. His work history includes unemployment from December 2007 to June \n2008, April to June 2011, July to October 2012, and January to March 2015. \n \n \nApplicant married in July 1984 and divorced in March 1996. He remarried in July \n2011. He has four adult children and two adult stepchildren. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2013 and financed it with student loans. (Tr. 21.) \n \n \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2005 and received a \ndischarge in 2006. Approximately $73,000 in delinquent debts were discharged. He \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nattributed his financial problems to legal fees totaling about $70,000 for child-custody \nlitigation and travel to visit his ailing mother. Most of the discharged debts were for \nbusiness loans and a credit-card account. (GX 12 at 3.) The bankruptcy is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.n. \n \nBetween 1996 and 2007, Applicant was charged with check fraud or uttering \nworthless checks about 21 times. At a personal appearance in November 2013, he \nadmitted these offenses, which occurred when he floated checks before sufficient funds \nwere in his account. (GX 12 at 2.) In his answer to the SOR, he attributed these \nfinancial problems to mistakes while trying to start and operate a business. The bad \nchecks are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. \n \n \nIn addition to the bankruptcy and bad-check offenses, the SOR alleges multiple \nfailures to timely file federal income tax returns, failures to timely pay federal income \ntaxes, delinquent student loans, and delinquent consumer debts. The federal tax debt, \nfederal tax liens, delinquent student loans, and delinquent consumer debts are reflected \nin credit reports from December 2012, October 2016, February 2018, and May 2019. \n(GX 3-6.) The bad- check offenses are reflected in arrest records maintained by the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation. (GX 7.) The evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems is summarized below. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: failure to timely file federal income tax returns for 2000 through \n2005, 2007, and 2010 through 2017. Applicant admitted this allegation in his answer to \nthe SOR. Tax transcripts submitted by Applicant in response to DOD CAF \ninterrogatories in June 2018 reflect that substitute returns were filed in 2004 by the IRS \nfor tax years 2000 and 2001; returns for 2002 through 2005 were filed in 2006; the \nreturn for 2007 was filed in September 2009; a return for 2010 was filed in November \n2011; a return for 2011 was filed in November 2012; returns for 2012 and 2013 were \nfiled in April 2018; and no returns had been filed for 2014 through 2017. (GX 9 at 27-\n65.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b-1.f: failure to timely pay the federal taxes due for 2005, 2006, and \n2007; federal tax debt of $54,297 for 2006; federal tax debt of $3,007 for 2007; \nfederal tax liens filed in September 2007 and February 2013. In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant denied that he failed to pay the taxes due. At the hearing, he admitted \nthat he did not make any voluntary payments, but he relied on garnishments and \ndiversions of refunds to pay the taxes due. (Tr. 44-45.) In April 2006, the IRS \nerroneously filed a tax lien for $1.4 million against Applicant. After Applicant challenged \nthe amount of the lien, the lien was released on February 2007. The IRS filed another \nlien for $43,264 in September 2007, and a third lien for $37,202 in February 2013. In \nFebruary 2018, Applicant hired an attorney to help him resolve his federal tax problems. \nHe testified that he could not hire professional help earlier because he did not have \nenough disposable income to pay the lawyer\u2019s $4,000 retainer fee. (Tr. 47-48.) The lien \nfor $43,264 was released in August 2018, and the $37,202 lien was released in \nFebruary 2019. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he provided evidence from his tax \nlawyer that he had filed the delinquent federal tax returns for 2010 through 2017 in \n\n \n4 \n \nDecember 2018, and that the refunds for tax years 2015 through 2017 were sufficient to \npay the delinquent taxes for the earlier years and resolve the tax liens that had been \nfiled against him.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: delinquent debt placed for collection of $1,161. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he presented documentary evidence that the debt had been settled. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.l: five delinquent student loans totaling about $44,000. In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant denied these debts, stating that they had not been \ndelinquent since 2017. The May 2019 credit report reflects five delinquent student \nloans, on which the last payment was made in April 2017. According to this credit \nreport, the scheduled payment for each loan was $703, but the actual payments were \n$99, $255, $166, $66, and $115. The loans are reflected as past due for $5,584; \n$15,420; $9,396; $3,753; and $6,504. (GX 6 at 2-3.) The credit report contradicts \nApplicant\u2019s documentation from the Department of Education (DOE), dated March 3, \n2019, reflecting monthly payments of $599 from April 2017 to July 2017; a $418 \npayment in July 2017; a $514 payment in August 2017; monthly payments of $876 from \nMarch 2018 to July 2018; and monthly payments of $703 from November 2018 to \nMarch 2019.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: delinquent debt for $747. In response to DOD CAF interrogatories, \nApplicant submitted evidence that this debt was settled for less than the full amount. \n(GX 9 at 72.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted an SCA in November 2012, he disclosed that he had \nnot filed his federal income tax returns for 2003, 2004, and 2005. He did not disclose \nthat he had failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2011. (GX 1 \nat 45-46.) At the hearing, he testified that he did not know why he did not disclose the \npast-due tax returns for 2010 and 2011. (Tr. 64.) \n \n \nDuring a personal appearance conducted by a DOHA administrative judge in \nNovember 2013, he testified that he had filed his federal income tax returns for 2000 \nthrough 2012. (GX 13 at 31.) At the hearing, he admitted that his answer during the \npersonal appearance was false. (Tr. 66.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his most recent SCA in July 2016, he answered \u201cNo\u201d \nto the question whether he had failed to file returns or pay federal, state, or other taxes \nduring the past seven years. (GX 2 at 48.) He did not disclose that he had failed to file \nreturns or pay taxes for 2010 through 2015. At the hearing, he testified that he did not \nknow why he answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. (Tr. 64.) \n \n \nIn response to DOD CAF financial interrogatories in March 2018, he stated that \nhe had filed his returns and paid the taxes for 2006 and 2007. (GX 8 at 4.) At the \nhearing, he admitted that these answers were false. (Tr. 68.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nIn response to DOD CAF interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial \nstatement in June 2018 reflecting that he and his wife had a joint net monthly income of \nabout $12,623; debt payments (including $1,100 in student loan payments) of $6,363; \nmortgage loan payments of $3,403; and a net monthly remainder of about $3,220. (GX \n9 at 73.) They reported total wage income of $208,981 for tax year 2017 and $258,948 \nfor tax year 2018. (AX B; AX C.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife own real estate worth more than $1,000,000. They own \nfour rental properties, two undeveloped lots, and their primary residence. In 2018, \nApplicant and his wife purchased three investment properties for $95,000; $45,000; and \nabout $70,000. The entire amounts were financed by the sellers. Their monthly \npayments are $1,900; $700; and $1,400. The properties are rented and generate \nmonthly income of about $7,000 per month. Applicant testified that he was comfortable \ntaking on additional debt because he believes he could sell each of them within 30 days \nif he needed to generate income. (Tr. 34-37; 71-72.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \n\n \n6 \n \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(d): deceptive or illegal financial practices such as . . . check fraud \n. . . and other intentional breaches of trust; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nand past-due tax returns are recent, numerous, and did not occur under circumstances \nmaking recurrence unlikely. It is established for the bankruptcy alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n \nand the bad checks alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o, which are mitigated by the passage of time. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s first period of unemployment was \ncaused by his voluntary decision to sell his business. However, he had several \nsubsequent periods of unemployment and pay reductions. He incurred substantial legal \nexpenses resolving custody of his children. His federal tax problems were complicated \nwhen the IRS erroneously filed a tax lien for $1.4 million. However, he has not acted \nresponsibly. He did not seriously address his past-due tax returns and federal tax debt \nuntil February 2018, after he realized that they were an impediment to his second \nattempt to qualify for a security clearance.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant would have been required to obtain \nfinancial counseling in connection with his bankruptcy petition in 2005. However, that \ncounseling would not have been directed at his tax problems, which were not resolved \nuntil he hired an attorney in 2018. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-\n1.l and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.m. The documentation from DOE shows \nthat Applicant has been making payments on his delinquent student loans. The DOE \ndocumentation is contradicted by the May 2019 credit report, but I have given more \ncredibility to the DOE documentation. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the tax debt, \nwhich was resolved by involuntary diversion of tax refunds, which do not constitute a \n\u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to resolve tax debts. See generally ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. \nBd. Feb. 24, 2011).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable but not dispositive. To his credit, Applicant has filed the \npast-due tax returns and resolved his tax debt. However, his eventual compliance with \nhis tax obligations does not end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a \ntax-enforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations \ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 15-00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n24, 2016), citing Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d \n173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). The fact that Applicant has filed \nhis past-due returns \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness based on longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). Applicants who begin to address their \nsecurity-significant conduct only when their personal interests are at stake may be \nlacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n\n \n9 \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing establish that \nApplicant falsified his SCA in November 2012, provided false testimony during a DOHA \npersonal appearance in November 2013, failed to disclose his failures to file income tax \nreturns in his July 2016 SCA, and falsified his answers to financial interrogatories in \nMarch 2018. His falsifications establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nand \n \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not attempt to correct his \nfalsifications until confronted with the evidence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications were recent, frequent, and \ndid not occur under unique circumstances. A falsification during the adjudication \nprocess is not minor, because it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \n \n\n \nWhole-Person Concept \n10 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his tax delinquencies and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs, 1.g-1.o: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n",

She asserted she had paid four of the delinquent medical obligations and that three of the listed debts were duplications. She admitted owing the additional 28 delinquent medical debts. After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old electrical engineer, who has worked for her employer since September 2017. (Item 1) She has never married or served in the military. In December 1996, she obtained her bachelor\u2019s degree, and in June 2010, obtained her master\u2019s degree. (Ex. 2) On Applicant\u2019s September 2017 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) she listed a $20,500 second mortgage taken out for a new roof on her home on which she planned to negotiate a repayment plan whereby she would pay $200 monthly. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Ex. 3) She listed $100,000 past due on her primary mortgage and planned to pay $1,000 monthly once a modification of the mortgage loan was reached. (Ex. 2) She listed $15,000 owned on medical debts and that she was negotiating a settlement estimating her monthly payments would be $100.

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n___________ \nDecision \n___________ \nHEINY, Claude, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR)1 alleged unpaid federal taxes for tax year \n2009, a past-due mortgage, and 35 additional delinquent medical obligations. She failed \nto mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,2 on August 17, \n2018, the DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. On September 7, 2018, Applicant answered the \nSOR and elected to have the matter decided without a hearing. On September 19, 2018, \n1 The record fails to contain the final page of the SOR. It is clear from the record that no additional SOR \nallegations were alleged. \n2 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective within the DoD on June \n8, 2017.  \n03/04/2019\n\n   \n \n2 \n \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Department Counsel (DC) submitted \nthe Government's case in a File of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM contained five \nattachments (Items). Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due on December 14, 2018. \nNo response to the FORM has been received by DOHA. On February 8, 2019, I was \nassigned the case.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 3 a summary of a subject interview of \nApplicant conducted on March 27, 2018. The summary was part of the DoD Report of \nInvestigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DoD personnel \nbackground report of investigation may be received in evidence and considered with an \nauthenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of \nEvidence. The interview summary did not bear the authentication required for \nadmissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of her opportunity to \nobject to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is \nno indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant \nwas provided a copy of the FORM and advised of her opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that she wanted the administrative judge to consider. The FORM advised \nApplicant of the following: \n \nNote to Applicant: Exhibit 3 is a summary of your Personal Subject Interview \n(PSI) and is being provided to the Administrative Judge for consideration as \npart of the record evidence in this case. In your response to this [FORM], \nyou can comment on whether the PSI summary accurately reflects the \ninformation you provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can \nmake any corrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make \nthe summary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground \nthat the report is unauthenticated by a Government witness. If no objections \nare raised in your response to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the \nFORM, the Administrative Judge may determine that you have waived any \nobjections to the admissibility of the summary and may consider the \nsummary as evidence in your case. \n \n \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the \nlegal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process \nrights or protections beyond those afforded her if she was represented by legal counsel. \nShe was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that she may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nshe was advised that she is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or \nmitigate facts admitted by her or proven by Department Counsel and that she has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \n\n   \n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of her opportunity to object to the admissibility \nof the interview summary, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any \ncorrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the report. Applicant is a college \ngraduate, who can reasonably be held to have understood the note, and she did not \nrespond to the FORM. Accordingly, I accepted Item 3 in the record, subject to issues of \nrelevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted she owed $8,000 in Federal \nincome tax for tax year 2009, and admitted to the delinquency on her mortgage payment, \nbut asserted there had been a loan modification. She asserted she had paid four of the \ndelinquent medical obligations and that three of the listed debts were duplications. She \nadmitted owing the additional 28 delinquent medical debts. After a thorough review of the \npleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old electrical engineer, who has worked for her employer \nsince September 2017. (Item 1) She has never married or served in the military. In \nDecember 1996, she obtained her bachelor\u2019s degree, and in June 2010, obtained her \nmaster\u2019s degree. (Ex. 2) \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s September 2017 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) she listed a $20,500 second mortgage taken out for a new roof on \nher home on which she planned to negotiate a repayment plan whereby she would pay \n$200 monthly. (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Ex. 3) She listed $100,000 past due on her primary mortgage \nand planned to pay $1,000 monthly once a modification of the mortgage loan was \nreached. (Ex. 2) She listed $15,000 owned on medical debts and that she was negotiating \na settlement estimating her monthly payments would be $100. She also listed a $500 \ntelephone bill and $500 cable bill on her e-QIP. These two debts are not listed as debts \nof concern on her SOR. (Ex. 2) On her e-QIP, she explained her financial problems were \ndue to loss of income, underemployment, and medical expenses. (Ex. 2) During her \nMarch 27, 2018 enhanced subject interview, she was questioned about all of her \ndelinquent financial obligations and specifically about all of the SOR delinquent \nobligations. (Ex. 3)  \n \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel stated: \n \nApplicant appears to have been actively engaged in attempting to resolve \nher debt through payments in full, negotiations with creditors and arranging \npayment plans. She has a desire to solve her financial issues, but there is \nno documentation substantiating any efforts. Additional documentation \nadded to this FORM by the Applicant would be beneficial for mitigation and \nreview by the administrative judge. \n \n\n   \n \n4 \n \n \nNo response to the FORM was received, which, of course, means there is no \ndocumentation of record supporting her assertions of payment, negotiating with her \ncreditors, or repayment plans received. \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s September 2018 SOR Response, she says she was unemployed \nfrom June 2009 through June 2011 and had incurred a Federal tax debt for 2009. (Ex. 1) \nShe admitted the tax debt was unpaid, and stated an intention to \u201cstart making payments \nbeginning next year.\u201d (Ex. 1) Between May 2014 and September 2017, she was \nunderemployed at minimum wage and not working in her profession as an engineer. (Ex. \n1)  \n \n \nIn 2010, due to Applicant\u2019s unemployment, her home went into foreclosure \nproceedings. Her monthly mortgage obligation was $998. She was 36 months behind on \nher mortgage payments at the time of the foreclosure. (Ex. 3) From June 2011 through \nJune 2013, she was working full time as an electrical engineer. However, the mortgage \ncompany would not accept payments from her until the matter of her mortgage \ndelinquency was heard in court. She fails to explain why she was not setting aside her \nmonthly mortgage in a separate account while she was full-time employed so she could \napply the money to her mortgage once a court ruling was made. As of July 2017, she \nowed $101,374 on the home and was $64,641 past due on her payments. (Ex. 3)  \n \nIn September 2017, the mortgage company was ordered to modify Applicant\u2019s loan \nand in July 2018, a modification was made. Applicant asserts she began making \npayments in August 2018. The scheduled monthly mortgage payments are $1,106. (Ex. \n3) She provided no documentation supporting her assertion of payments. \n \n \nApplicant incurred an $8,000 federal tax debt (SOR 1. a) when she withdrew funds \nfrom her 401(k) retirement plan in 2009. She used the funds to prevent foreclosure on her \nhome. (Ex. 3) Initially her tax liability was $15,000, but the amount was reduced to $8,000 \nwhen a tax refund was intercepted and applied to the tax debt. (Ex. 3) She asserted she \nworked with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concerning the debt, and she receives a \nletter every six months informing her of the balance owed. (Ex. 3)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 35 delinquent medical debts, totaling $12,146. The debts include \n13 debts of less than $100 each, 12 debts of between $100 and $200 each, 7 debts of \nmore than $200 each, and 3 debts that are duplication of other debts. In July 2015, \nApplicant had a knee replacement. Her medical health insurance had a high deductible \nresulting in her insurance paying a smaller amount of her medical expenses. (Ex. 1) She \nmade her co-payments. In May 2016, she fell and broke her knee cap. Her high deductible \nagain made her insurance reimbursement low. She said she had to negotiate a settlement \nfor her medical expenses incurred in 2015 and 2016. \n \n \nIn September 2017, Applicant returned to full-time employment as an electrical \nengineer. At the time of her March 2018 enhanced subject interview, she asserted with \nher current employment she will be able to repay her delinquent financial obligations. (Ex. \n3) She expressed an intention to have all of her medical debts paid within two years. (Ex. \n\n   \n \n5 \n \n \n3) She asserts since returning to full-time employment, she is paying a bill a month. She \nasserted when she responded to the SOR she had paid the $858 medical bill (SOR 1.s, \nSOR 1.t is a duplicate debt), the $831 medical debt (SOR 1.u), the $531 medical bill (SOR \n1.v), and the $150 collection debt (SOR 1.z) in August 2018 (Ex. 1) She provided no \ndocumentation supporting her assertions of payment of these debts. \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \n\n   \n \n6 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage her finances to meet her financial obligations. \n \nApplicant owes the IRS $8,000 for tax year 2009 due to her withdrawing funds \nfrom her 401(k) retirement plan. She was also more than $64,000 past due on her \nmortgage and owed 32 medical collections accounts totally more than $12,000. AG \u00b6 19 \nincludes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern any may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and \n\u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f). The burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005)). Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of \n\n   \n \n7 \n \n \nexplanation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n (g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct. She asserts she \nhas paid some of the debts, but provided no documentation of any payments. The FORM \nput her on notice that providing documentation substantiating her efforts to address her \ndelinquent obligations would be beneficial for mitigation. No documentation was received.  \nApplicant owes $8,000 in Federal income tax for tax year 2009. The tax obligation \nremains unpaid. In her September 2018 SOR response, she said she would start making \npayments toward her tax delinquency in 2019. She also stated she had been working with \n\n   \n \n8 \n \n \nthe IRS to address her tax obligation. However, she provided no documentation \nsupporting this assertion. She says her mortgage has been modified, and she has been \nmaking her monthly mortgage payments since August 2018. She provided no \ndocumentation showing payments on her mortgage. She asserted she paid four \ndelinquent medical obligations, which totaled approximately $2,400, in August 2018. It \nwas her intent to pay one delinquent debt each month, but she provided no documentation \nshowing repayment.  \n \nApplicant timely filed her Federal income tax return for tax year 2009, but her tax \ndebt still has security implications. The Appeal Board has held as follows:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nThe Appeal Board ruled that \u201ceven in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016). \n \nApplicant has not sufficiently satisfied any of the mitigating conditions to overcome \nthe financial considerations security concerns raised by her extensive delinquencies. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply because the behavior did not happen long ago. The behavior was \nnot infrequent since there were a large number of delinquent debts. She had periods of \nunemployment, underemployment, and medical expenses, which are factors beyond her \ncontrol. However, Applicant must demonstrate she has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Even though she asserted she has acted responsibly by repaying some \nof her debts, she failed to document her actions. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \nThere is no evidence of Applicant having received financial counseling or that her \nfinancial problems are resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. She asserts \nshe has paid some of the debts, but without documentation she has failed to establish a \ngood-faith effort to repay her creditors. Even if she paid a few of her debts, those efforts \n\n   \n \n9 \n \n \nare insufficient to establish AG \u00b6 20(d) given the number of delinquent accounts with no \nrepayment plans established. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. In this instance AG \u00b6 20(g) does \nnot apply. Even though Applicant has filed her 2009 tax return, she has failed to document \nher communication with the IRS. Additionally, she has not started repaying the $8,000 \noutstanding tax delinquency.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nAs Department Counsel stated in the FORM, it appeared Applicant had been \nactively engaged in attempting to resolve her debt through payments in full, negotiations \nwith creditors, arranging payment plans, and has a desire to solve her financial issues. \nHowever, she failed to provide documentation substantiating her efforts even after being \ninformed documentation would be beneficial for mitigation.  \n \nAlthough Applicant has made assertions to the contrary, there is no documentary \nevidence Applicant has contacted her creditors and has paid some of her delinquent \nobligations. An applicant is not required to be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off \nall debts immediately or simultaneously, but she is required to act responsibly given her \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). What constitutes \nresponsible behavior depends on the facts of a given case. Applicant\u2019s poor financial \ncondition originated in part from periods of unemployment and medical problems. She \nmust document she has established a plan to resolve financial problems and taken \nsignificant action to implement the plan, which is not shown in the record.  \n \n\n   \n \n10 \n \n \nIn requesting an administrative determination, Applicant chose to rely on the \nwritten record. In so doing, however, she failed to submit sufficient information or \nevidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding her \ncircumstances, articulate her position, and mitigate the financial security concerns. She \nfailed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation regarding her \npast efforts to address her delinquent debt. By failing to provide such information, and in \nrelying solely on her explanation in her SOR Response, financial considerations security \nconcerns remain.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance is not a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under Applicant=s \ncurrent circumstances, a clearance is not warranted. In the future, Applicant may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness.  \n \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid\u2014it \nis whether her financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)). Overall, the record evidence due to a lack of documentation \nleaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nfinancial considerations concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.e \u2013 1.m,  \n1.o \u2013 1.s, and 1.u \u2013 1.kk:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d., 1.n, and 1.t: \nFor Applicant (duplicate debts) \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 7, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 27, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on November 26, 2018. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on December 28, 2018, and had 30 days to submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant responded on January 14, 2019, by \n02/19/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nproviding a two-page typed statement. This response was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \n(AE) A and it was admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s \ndocuments, identified as Items 1 through 3, were also admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on January 30, 2019.  \n \n                                      Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about Afghanistan. The request and the attached source documents \nwere not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) \nI. All of the documents referenced in the Request for Administrative Notice and the facts \nasserted therein, are from open sources and are dated. Afghanistan has been plagued \nby corruption and human rights abuses; it is often lawless; and it has been described as \na failed-nation-state. The United States has been at war there for over 17 years. \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe HE I source documents, and incorporated them by reference. The facts are \nsummarized in the written request and are incorporated by reference in this decision. \n \nDepartment Counsel also astutely withdrew SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b through 1.g in the \nGovernment\u2019s FORM. The remaining allegations include only SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.h, \nwhich both concern Applicant\u2019s mother.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old interpreter-translator sponsored for a security \nclearance by a defense contractor.

Applicant has contact with his mother by telephone \nonce every other day. She is 56 years old, lives with Applicant\u2019s brother, and she is not \nemployed outside her home. She has never been affiliated with the Afghanistan \ngovernment, or any other foreign government. His mother knows about Applicant\u2019s \ntranslator services, but does not tell others that he is working in support of U.S. \nconcerns, out of fear for his safety. Applicant sends his mother $500 to $700 dollars \neach month to help with her rent and groceries. He sent her $15,000 between 2009 and \n2017. Applicant has no sympathy, preference for, or alliance with foreign nationals \nexcept his mother.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n4 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan. Afghanistan is \ncontinuously at war and continues to have human rights problems, rampant corruption, \nand terrorist attacks. It remains a safe haven for terrorism, and has been unstable for at \nleast 17 years. Applicant\u2019s foreign contact with his mother may create a potential conflict \nof interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence. \nAlthough, he sends his mother financial aid monthly, Applicant has no expectation of \never receiving that money back. Thus, he has no financial or property interests in \nAfghanistan.  \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.3  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \n                                                          \n3 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations under Guideline B, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.h, \nin his answer to the SOR of October 2018. These contacts with his mother, and \nfurnishing of financial aid to her, together with country conditions that create a \nheightened risk of coercion or exploitation, raise security concerns.     \n \n \nApplicant came to the United States in 2006. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.  \nApplicant has gone in harm\u2019s way repeatedly in Afghanistan, and supported the U.S. \nmilitary in a war zone for 18 months.4 He has longstanding relationships and loyalties \nhere in the U.S. Although he has provided financial support to a foreign citizen in the \npast, it was reasonable under the circumstances. He is gainfully employed by a federal \ncontractor and appears to be a solid citizen. He continues to have regular contact with \nhis mother in Afghanistan, which is to be expected of a dutiful son. There is no \nindication that she is affiliated with the Afghanistan government or intelligence services. \nHis mother knows about his interpreter services and is not vulnerable to foreign \ncoercion or exploitation. Applicant is committed to his new life here. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) \nare applicable to the Afghanistan family-member-foreign contacts, which are alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.h. Because Applicant\u2019s ties to Afghanistan are minimal and \ninconsequential, I find that all foreign influence concerns have been mitigated.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n                                                          \n4 The Appeal Board has held that \u201can Applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense of the United States \nis very important and can lead to a favorable result for an Applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case \n04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. March 20, 2007). \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated foreign influence and personal conduct security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.h \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Smith, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has illegally used marijuana with varying frequency since 2010. He \nintends to continue using it. He did not mitigate the resulting security concerns. Based \nupon a review of the record as a whole, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nHistory of Case \nOn May 31, 2017, Applicant submitted his first application for a security clearance \n(SCA). On August 31, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). Applicant \nanswered the SOR in writing on October 6, 2018 (Answer), and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. \n The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on \nFebruary 7, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 12, 2019, setting the \nhearing for February 27, 2019. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 3 into evidence. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through \nD into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without objection.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. \n(GE 1) In April 2017, he began a position with a Federal contractor. Prior to this job, he \nworked for a private company. (GE 1)  \n \n \nApplicant disclosed a history of illegal drug abuse in his May 2017 SCA. He was \narrested for possessing marijuana in July 2010 and July 2016. (GE 1) The 2010 charge \nwas expunged. Applicant was fined $300 for the 2016 charge. (Tr. 21; GE 1, GE 2, GE \n3) Applicant disclosed that he first used marijuana in April 2010, and claimed that his last \nuse was in July 2014. He noted that he used it five to ten times, purchased marijuana five \ntimes while in college and high school, and used LSD twice while in college. (GE 1)  \n \n \nOn April 20, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). He told the investigator that he used marijuana beyond \nthe July 2014 date he disclosed in his May 2017 SCA. He stated he continued to use \nmarijuana infrequently after July 2014. He stated he did not feel dependent on the drug. \n(GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant intends to continue possessing and using marijuana because he \nbelieves that it does not affect his ability to perform his job. He used it twice in the week \nbefore his hearing, including the day before. He uses it socially, generally about twice a \nweek. He does not have a recognized medical reason for using it.1 He is aware that his \nrecreational use is illegal under both his state\u2019s and Federal law. He used it after he \ncompleted his May 2017 SCA. (Tr. 18-19, 28) He has never been given a drug screening \nby his current employer. He does not know if his current employer has a zero-tolerance \npolicy related to using illegal drugs. (Tr. 28-29)  \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted four letters of recommendation from members of his \nemployer\u2019s supervisory staff. All of them compliment Applicant for his high level of \nperformance and reliability. (AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D) Applicant said these people are \naware of his marijuana use, although they did not comment on it. (Tr. 25) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n                                            \n1 Medical marijuana is legal in the state in which Applicant lives. Possession of it, up to 10 grams, has been \ndecriminalized since 2016.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExecutive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \n \nThe security concerns under the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24: \n  \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he has illegally used marijuana since 2010, with varying \nfrequency, and subsequent to completing his 2017 SCA. He intends to continue using it \nin the future. The evidence establishes security concerns under the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nAG & 26 provides conditions that could possibly mitigate the drug-related security \nconcerns raised in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nThere is no evidence to establish any of the above mitigating conditions. Applicant \nhas a long history of abusing illegal drugs that began in 2010, while in high school. His \nregular marijuana use continues to date, and casts doubt on his judgment. He \nacknowledges that possessing and using marijuana, especially while working for a \nFederal contractor, is illegal and may jeopardize his employment, but expresses his \nintention to continue doing so. He has a long history of frequent marijuana use, but has \nnot been evaluated for substance abuse or addiction, or participated in a treatment \nprogram.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in this whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nAfter listening to his testimony and observing his demeanor, I found Applicant to \nbe candid about his history of marijuana use and staunchly determined to continue using \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nit, despite the fact that it violates state and Federal criminal laws and may jeopardize his \nrequest for a security clearance. Overall, the evidence creates significant doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and suitability for a security clearance. It raises serious \nconcerns about his ability or willingness to follow rules and regulations. He failed to meet \nhis burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.  \n \nStatutory Prohibition2 \n \n \nIndependent of analysis under the AG, the Bond Amendment, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3343, \nprohibits Federal agencies from granting or renewing national security eligibility to any \nunlawful user of a controlled substance.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 31, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 21, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n03/18/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on January 17, \n2019. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 8. Applicant was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant provided a timely response \nto the FORM, which is marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. There were no objections to \nany of the evidence offered. Items 1 through 8 and AE A are admitted into evidence. The \ncase was assigned to me on February 27, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He married in 1984 and has three grown children. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree and a doctorate degree from a prestigious university. He is a \nrenowned expert in his field. He started his own company in 1992, which has received \ndefense contracts throughout the years. Applicant has held a security clearance since \napproximately 1988, at various levels, including secret, top secret, and access to sensitive \ncompartment information.1  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that from about 1977 to about August 2017, he used marijuana \nwith varying frequency. He used marijuana while holding a security clearance from about \nDecember 1998 to August 2017.2 He admitted that he purchased marijuana from about \nOctober 2016 to August 2017, while granted access to classified information.3 \n \n \nApplicant completed security clearance applications (SCA) in November 2006 and \nJune 2012. He admitted he deliberately falsified material facts in both SCAs by not \ndisclosing his previous marijuana use, and his use while holding a security clearance.4  \n \n \nIn November 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \ntold the investigator that he had been told over the years, dating back to when he \ncompleted his first SCA, that he should answer \u201cno\u201d to the questions on the SCA related \nto drugs. He declined to disclose to the investigator who told him to answer untruthfully. \n                                                          \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Items 2, 3. The SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana from December 1998 to about August 2017, while \nholding a security clearance. The evidence included in the FORM shows Applicant held a clearance from \n1988 to August 2017, and during that time he used marijuana. I will only consider the time period alleged \nin the SOR for disqualifying purposes, but may consider the total period when making a credibility \ndetermination, in mitigation, and in my whole-person analysis.  \n \n3 Items 2, 3, 7; AE A. \n \n4 Items 5, 6. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHe stated that there was never an issue in his mind that his marijuana use was impacting \nnational security.5 In his answer to the SOR, he stated: \n \nIn 1986, at the age of 26 and just coming out of college and applying for my \nfirst clearance, it was recommended to me by a superior that I disavow any \nmarijuana use. I did just that, and that lie carried forward through the years \nand subsequent security clearance applications. I note that I have held a \nsecurity clearance since 1986 and there has been no other drug use, no \nother lies, and no other violations.6 \n \n \nApplicant stated in his answer and FORM responses that he used marijuana at \nsocial gatherings beginning in 1977. He said his use was more sporadic and not monthly. \nThis was a correction from what he told the investigator regarding monthly use.7  \n \n \nIn 2015 and 2016, Applicant was working a full time job, which was stressful, and \nhe also founded a non-profit foundation to purchase a recreational area he felt passionate \nabout. The stress of dealing with both affected his health. He indicated that for a variety \nof medical reasons, including stress and anxiety, two health care providers recommended \nthat he obtain a medical marijuana card, which allowed him to purchase marijuana under \nthe state law where he was living. He admitted these health care professionals were \nunaware that Applicant held a security clearance. He obtained the medical marijuana card \nin October 2016. At that point his family and friends became aware of his use.8  \n \n \nAfter receiving the medical marijuana card, he purchased marijuana from \ndispensaries. He began to use marijuana daily and multiple times a day using a vape pen. \nHe also smoked it from a pipe and consumed it through edibles. He indicated it lowered \nhis anxiety, and he continued his pattern of use until approximately April 2017, when the \neffect of the drug began having a negative impact on him. It made him paranoid and \nnervous. He continued to use marijuana daily despite the negative effects until June 2017, \nwhen he decided to stop using it. Applicant went through three days of withdrawal \nsymptoms, and then felt better. Since ceasing daily use of marijuana in June 2017, \nApplicant has used marijuana on two other occasions. He indicated that he inhaled it once \non two separate occasions. His explanation for using it two more times was to confirm \nthat marijuana still had an undesirable and unpleasant effect on him. Applicant told the \ngovernment investigator that he does not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug \nin the future.9 \n \n                                                          \n5 Item 7. \n \n6 Item 2. Presumably, Applicant is referring to no other drug use other than marijuana. \n \n7 Items 2, 3, 7; AE A. \n \n8 Items 2, 3, 7; AE A. \n \n9 Items 2, 7; AE A. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant sought legal advice about the status of his company and the effect his \ndisclosure about using marijuana while holding a security clearance would have on it. He \nwas advised to step aside from his company until his drug use issue was resolved, which \nhe did. He then reported his marijuana use to his facilities security officer and the chief \nexecutive officer.10  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM he stated:  \n \nI have used marijuana more or less most of my life, in a manner similar to \nalcohol, and I did not disclose it on my security clearance applications. In \nmy view of previous settled cases, I can truthfully think of no basis and no \nargument that would allow, under current law, for me to hold a security \nclearance.11  \n \nApplicant indicated in his answer to the SOR that his expertise in his field warrants \nreinstating his security clearance. In his FORM response, he indicated that he genuinely \nbelieves he is a good and honest person except for this one serious indiscretion. He has \nunique experience and capabilities that could benefit the safety of our country. Applicant \napologized for his actions and accepts that he let his colleagues, family, and country \ndown.12 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n                                                          \n10 Items 2, 7; AE A. \n \n11 AE A. \n \n12 AE C. \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he has used marijuana with varying frequency from \napproximately 1977 to about August 2017. He was granted a security clearance in \napproximately 1988. He purchased marijuana from about October 2016 to August 2017. \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency for approximately 40 years. Even \nafter receiving a security clearance in about 1988, he continued to use marijuana. In 2016, \nhe received a medical marijuana card from the state where he lives. He did not disclose \nto his health care providers that he held a security clearance. He purchased marijuana \nfrom October 2016 to August 2017. He began using marijuana daily. He was fully aware \nthat his actions, both prior to receiving the card and after, were illegal under Federal law \nand impermissible while holding a security clearance. He stopped using marijuana \nbecause it started to have negative health effects on him. He later decided to use it two \nmore times to see if the negative effects continued, indicating his motive for stopping was \nbecause it made him feel badly, not because it was a violation while holding a security \nclearance. His conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant stopped using marijuana when its effects made him feel physically and \npsychologically sick. After abstaining for a period, he decided to try it again to test if it \nwould continue to make him ill. He used it twice more and confirmed its negative effects. \nIt appears his last use was in August 2017. Applicant stated in the record that he did not \nintend to use marijuana in the future. I have considered his comments. Applicant did not \nprovide any evidence of participation in drug treatment, rehabilitation, or aftercare \nprograms. He did not provide a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) has minimal application. There is insufficient evidence to \napply AG \u00b6 26(d).  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 16, and one that may be \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his marijuana use on his 2006 and 2012 \nSCAs. He deliberately lied on both applications by denying he had ever used marijuana \nwhile holding a security clearance. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n  \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omissions, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or a person \nwith professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant indicated when he completed his first SCA in 1986, a supervisor told him \nto lie about his drug use, which he did. Despite being aware that illegal drug use was \nprohibited while holding a security clearance, he continued to use marijuana for decades. \nHe then repeatedly lied about using marijuana while holding a security clearance and also \nlied about his more recent drug use. The evidence does not support the application of \nany of the above mitigating conditions.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. As an expert in his field, he has provided valuable \nresearch and development that was important to our nation\u2019s defense. Unfortunately, for \nalmost 30 years while holding a security clearance, he disregarded the law by using \nmarijuana. He then repeatedly lied about it on his SCAs. Applicant stopped using \nmarijuana for a period of time because it began having a negative effect on his health. \nHowever, he was not convinced that it created a problem for him, and he decided to test \n\n \n9 \n \n \nit again by using it two more times before he quit. Although he is remorseful, his abject \nand repeated violation of the trust bestowed on him after he was granted a security \nclearance remains a security concern. The record evidence leaves me with serious \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Or) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2,1992), as amended (Directive); and by the Security \nExecutive Agent, Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 6, 2018, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on February 12, 2018, and interposed no objections to the materials in the \nFORM. Applicant did not supplement the FORM with exhibits of his own. \nIn its FORM materials, the Government requested administrative notice of facts \ndetailed in 13 official source documents that are official Government publications. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007). Administrative \nnotice is appropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well known. See \nStein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). For good cause shown, \nadministrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named official background \nreports addressing the geopolitical situation in Iraq. \nAdministrative notice was extended to the requested facts and cited source \ndocuments, consistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. \nThis notice did not foreclose consideration of information about the country not covered \nin the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice, so as to ensure accurate and \ntimely assessments of the country\u2019s changing political landscape. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged in the SOR to (a) own property in Iraq \nwith an approximate value of $620,000; (b) have a stepmother who is a citizen and \nresident of Iraq; and (c) have in-laws who are citizens and residents of Iraq. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations without explanation. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 48-year old linguist for a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted \nas relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant was born and raised in Iraq and immigrated to the United States in \nOctober 2009 on a refugee visa. (Items 1-3 and 5) In June 2015, Applicant became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen and received a U.S. passport in July 2015. (Item 3) He acquired \nan Iraqi passport in August 2007 and surrendered it in August 2015 after becoming a \nU.S. citizen. (Item 3) While Applicant still holds Iraqi citizenship, he has expressed a \nwillingness to renounce it. (Item 3) \nApplicant married in March 2003 and has three children from this marriage (ages \n14, 12, and 10). (Item 3) While the oldest two children were born in Iraq, the youngest \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nchild was born in the United States. Applicant reported no educational information or \nactive duty military service. (Item 3) \nSince June 2017, Applicant has worked as a linguist for a defense contractor. \n(Item 3) Previously, he worked for other non-defense employers in various jobs. He \nreported brief periods of unemployment in 2016 and 2009. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s family ties in Iraq \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents passed away: his father in 1984 and his mother in \n1993. (GE 3) Applicant has a stepmother, a mother-in-law and father-in-law, a sister-in\u00ad\nlaw, and a brother-in-law who are citizens and residents of Iraq. He maintains monthly \ncontact with his family members, and sometimes more frequently. (Items 3 and 5) Little \nis known about the backgrounds of his family members. His father-in-law is a retired \nmember of the Iraqi Army. His rank, pension entitlements, and ties to other members \npast and present of the Iraqi Army are unknown. (Item 5) Based on information he \nprovided in his OPM summary of interview in July 2017, one sister-in-law works for an \nArab arbitration international center; while another sister-in-law works for an Arab \nembassy in Iraq. (Item 5) What affiliations and roles each sister-in-law plays in the \nidentified Arab organizations is not reported in any of the exhibits in the record. (Item 5) \nNothing about affiliations and associations of Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is reported in \nany of the exhibits. \nApplicant owns property in Iraq, which he purchased in 2007 for approximately \n$200,000. (Item 5) He purchased this property (a single family home) for himself, and \nhis wife and children to live in when his work in the Iraqi American Green Zone ended. \n(Item 5) In 2012, he and his family occupied the home. Applicant estimated the value of \nthe home at the time to be approximately $620,000. (Item 5) Currently, he values the \nhome at just over $450,000. He hopes to sell the home when market conditions \nimprove. (Item 5) But he could provide no clear estimates of when conditions will permit \nhim to dispose of the property. (Item 5) \nApplicant comes from a family of considerable wealth. (Item 5) Before his \npassing, his grandfather acquired considerable wealth from building and operating an \ninternational trading business in Iraq. Since his grandfather\u2019s death, Applicant\u2019s relatives \nhave managed his grandfather\u2019s estate. (Item 5) Applicant has obtained some \ninheritance proceeds from his grandfather\u2019s estate (approximately $45,000) and \nanticipates more to come once the estate winds down and distributions are made to \nqualified family beneficiaries. (Item 5)  \nIraq\u2019s country status \nIraq is a country with a population of 27 million that is broken down along ethnic \nand religious lines: Shiites, Sunni, Kurds and Turkoman comprise the predominant \nethnic and sectarian groups.   Once known as Mesopotamia (the fertile crescent), Iraq is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbordered by Kuwait, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. See Background \nNote, Iraq, at 2-3, U.S. Dept. of State (Feb. 2008) \nAt the end of World War I, Iraq \nbecame a British-mandated territory, and founding member of the Arab League. (id.) \nGeneral Abdul Karim Qasim assumed power in a July 1958 coup and held power \nfor five years before succumbing to the Ba\u2019ath Party\u2019s takeover of the Iraqi government, \nand Hasan al-Bakr\u2019s selection as prime minister. See Background Note, Iraq, supra, at \n4. When Bakr resigned in 1979, Saddam  Hussein assumed the reigns of power. Under \nSaddam Hussein\u2019s direction, Iraq launched a major invasion of its neighbor, Iran, in the \n1980s. See the World Factbook: Iraq, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (Feb. 2018); \nBackground Note Iraq, supra. Iraq declared victory in 1988 and survived to claim the \nlargest military establishment in the region. Iraq then turned its forces to mounted \nattacks against the ongoing Kurdish rebellion by Kurdish elements in the northern \nmountains of Iraq.  (Id.) \nIraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and was repelled by a U.S.-led coalition in \nFebruary 1991. See World Factbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note, Iraq, supra. After \nthe war, the United Nations UN) Security Council required the Hussein regime to \nsurrender to the coalition and submit to UN inspections. When the Ba\u2019ath regime \nrefused to fully comply, the Security Council invoked sanctions to prevent further \nweapons of mass destruction (WMD) development, and to enforce Iraq\u2019s surrender \nterms.  Coalition forces employed limited no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq and \na limited no-drive zone in southern Iraq to prevent the regime from invading Kuwait \nagain. (Id.) \nIn 2003, A U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq and succeeded in removing Saddam \nHussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime from military and political power. See The World \nFactbook: Iraq, supra;  Background Note Iraq, supra, at 3.  After two years of operations \nunder a provisional authority, Iraq\u2019s new government assumed office in March 2006 \n(with the approval of the U.S. Government), following free elections. (id.) \nNotwithstanding the election of a new national government with U.S. backing, \nviolence continued to envelop Iraq. This violence was fueled and perpetrated by Al \nQieda terrorists, Sunni insurgents, and, Shiite militias and death squads. See The World \nFactbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note Iraq, supra. State Department reports \ndocument human rights abuses that include a \u201cpervasive climate of violence, \nmisappropriation of official authority by sectarian, criminal and insurgent groups; \narbitrary deprivation of life, disappearances, torture and other cruel, inhumane or \ndegrading treatment or punishment.\u201d (Id.) \nSince March 2006, the Government of Iraq has been comprised of a broad \ncoalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish blocs. See The \nWorld Factbook: Iraq, supra, at 2; Background Note Iraq, supra. at 8. While elections \nhave been held, none of the key constituent groups have been able to form a \ngovernment, adopt an oil law, establish and maintain effective security throughout the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovinces, or neutralize sectarian divisions. In this still very fragile political environment \nin Iraq, there are substantiated reports of human rights abuses that continue to \nunderscore a still pervasive climate of tension and violence. \nEconomic developments \nIraq\u2019s economy continues to be dominated by the oil sector, as it has for the past \nhalf century since the completion of new pipelines to Lebanon in 1949, and to Syria in \n1952. See The World Factbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note Iraq, supra. As a result \nof the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, much of Iraq\u2019s oil-refining capabilities were shuttered. \nThe rebuilding of oil infrastructure and utilities infrastructure has continued to expand \nsince 2004 with U.S. aid and support, despite setbacks from insurgent activity. \nProposed oil revenue-sharing legislation among the three war-hardened ethno\u00ad\nsectarian divisions (Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds) still awaits passage after years of stalled \nnegotiations, however, and at the moment, there are no good estimates of when such \nlegislation will be approved and implemented. See Statement for the Record, Worldwide \nThreat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, U.S. Director of National \nIntelligence (Feb. 2018) For the foreseeable future, the national government can be \nexpected to continue to seek the passage and implementation of a revenue sharing law \nto strengthen and encourage the development of this important sector. See id. \nRecent reports (although not official U.S. pronouncements) suggest that \nBaghdad is close to agreement with the semi-autonomous Kurdish regional government \n(KRG) to restart crude flowing from the Kirkuk oil fields as U.S. sanctions against Iran \nhit Iran\u2019s energy sales. See Iraq Closing in on Deal to Resume Kirkuk Oil Exports, \nReuters/Bloomberg (Nov. 2018). If these estimates prove to be accurate, they should be \nwelcomed by both U.S. and allied Interests. \nDespite Iraq\u2019s producing 4.3 million barrels of oil per day, according to published \nreports, Iraq\u2019s population remains poor. See Putting Iraq-KRG Oil Relations on Solid \nLegal Ground, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (July 2018). Currently, the \ncase brought by the federal government of Iraq against the KRG in 2012 over the \nlegality of the KRG\u2019s oil contracts and independent exports remains pending with no \ndisposition projected in the near future. See Id. \nPast budget laws passed by Iraq\u2019s national parliament requiring the KRG to \ncontribute certain export earnings in the country\u2019s overall exports (a law that would \nseem to legitimate the KRG\u2019s ownership claims to Kirkuk oil) have never led federal \nauthorities to export Kirkuk-produced oil. In so doing, Iraq\u2019s federal authorities have \nseverely limited Iraq\u2019s northern export outlet via the Kurdish pipeline to Turkey. Breaking \nthe oil-stalemate that existed for years between the KRG and Iraq\u2019s federal government \ncan have major positive ramifications for not only Iraq and its oil exports, but for the \nUnited States and other Western interests as well. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTerrorism and human rights issues \nDespite recent improvements in its security enforcement efforts, Iraq remains a \nvery dangerous, volatile and unpredictable country.

Based on the U.S. State \nDepartment\u2019s most recent annual human rights report, violence continued throughout \n2017, largely fueled by the actions of the Islamic state in Iraq (ISIS). See Statement for \nthe Record, Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, supra. \nAfter liberating all territory taken by ISIS by the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) \nhave continued to pursue and restrict ISIS forces still active in Iraq. \nReports of human rights abuses include allegations of unlawful killings by some \nmembers of the ISF (particularly by some members of the Popular Mobilization Forces \n(PMF). Reports of human rights abuses also include allegations of unlawful killings, \ntorture, harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities, \ncriminalization of libel and other limits on freedom of expression, widespread corruption, \ngreatly reduced penalties for so-called honor killings, coerced or forced abortions \nimposed by ISIS on its victims, legal restrictions imposed on the freedom of movement \nof women, and trafficking in persons.

See R. Alaaldin, What Iraq\u2019s election Results Mean for U.S. \nPolicy \nat \n1-6, \nhttps://brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos \n(May \n2018). \nThis \nparliamentary election marks the first such federal election since the defeat of ISIS in \nDecember 2017 and was historic in many respects with over 7,000 candidates vying for \n329 seats.

See U.S. Relations with Iraq at 1-2, U.S. Dept. of State \n(July 2018). In coordination with the Global Coalition to defeat ISIS, the United States \nassisted Iraq\u2019s efforts to achieve the long-sought goal of liberating all of Iraqi territory \nfrom ISIS. The Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the United \nStates provides the basis of the United States\u2019s bilateral relationship with Iraq and \ncovers a wide range of bilateral issues, including political relations and diplomacy, \ndefense and security, trade and finance, energy, judicial and law enforcement issues, \nservices, science, culture, education, and environment. (id.) \nU.S. bilateral assistance to Iraq is considerable and stresses economic reform, \nassistance to vulnerable groups, and democracy and governance. See U.S. Relations \nwith Iraq, supra. U.S. security assistance supports the development of modern, \naccountable, fiscally sustainable, and professional Iraqi military resources capable of \ndefending Iraq and its borders. \nThe United States has designated Iraq as a beneficiary developing country under \nthe Generalized System of Preferences program and has been proactive in the \npromotion of two-way trade between the United States and Iraq. (id, at 2) Noteworthy, \nIraq\u2019s re-integration into the international community has been marked by their \ndemonstrated cooperation with international institutions, including the United Nations, \nInternational Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the Arab League.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a \nsufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about \nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nForeign Influence \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not \nlimited to, business, financial, and property interests, are a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n(see AG \u00b6 6) \nBurden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to \ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because \nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the \nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's \neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and \nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800 \n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences \nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, \nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or \nconjecture. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that \nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or \nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not \nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually \nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security \nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted \nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of \nExec. Or. 10865 that all security \nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the \nultimate burden of demonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis \nApplicant is a dual citizen of Iraq and the United States who has family \nmembers (a stepmother, in-laws, a sister-in-laws, and a brother-in-law) who are \ncitizens and residents of Iraq. Security concerns are raised under the foreign influence \nguideline due to Applicant\u2019s longstanding family ties to Iraq. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s contacts with his stepmother, in-laws, brother-in-law and \nsister-in-laws residing in Iraq appear to be modest (monthly and occasionally more \noften), they do involve close family members. And still not resolved are his property \ninterests in Iraq that Applicant wants to sell when economic conditions improve. But to \ndate, he is still holding the property. \nConditions in Iraq raise heightened country risks as well. While Iraq is a \nliberated ally of the United States, it is a country that has encountered difficulty \nforming a government in the past and continues to experience ethno-sectarian \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconflicts between principal factions and is considered a country with a poor human \nrights record and an unsafe country for U.S. citizens to visit by the U.S. State \nDepartment. \nForeign influence concerns \nKey to the Government\u2019s foreign influence concerns are Applicant\u2019s extended \nfamily members (i.e., his stepmother, in-laws, sisters-in-law and brother-in-law) who \nare Iraqi citizens and still reside in Iraq, a country that is still in the process of \nestablishing a stable democratic government able to protect all of its disparate \nconstituent groups and maintain peace with its neighbors. Despite encouraging \ndevelopments in Iraq following the federal elections of May 2018, Iraq is still a very \ndangerous and volatile country in certain sectors with an overall poor human rights \nrecord and heightened risks of terrorism in most sectors of the country. \nApplicant\u2019s presumably close relationships with his extended family members \nresiding in Iraq make them potentially vulnerable to coercion and non-coercive \nmeasures because of their close familial family ties with Applicant. Because the Iraq \nSFs and non-governmental entities (principally ISIS) operating in Iraq, as well as the \nformer Iraqi military and intelligence authorities, have a history of violating Iraqi \ndomestic laws and regulations, and international laws, they are more likely to use \nimproper and/or illegal means to obtain classified information in Applicant\u2019s \npossession or control through his siblings and in-laws. \nNoting that Applicant\u2019s contacts with his Iraqi family members typically take \nplace in potentially hostile security environs, the Government urges security concerns \nover risks that his telephonic contacts with his family members in Iraq might be subject \nto exploitation, coercion, or duress by Iraqi military and government authorities to \naccess classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control. Applicant\u2019s activities \nwarrant some application of two of the disqualifying conditions of the foreign influence \nguideline: DC \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \nThe citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s in-laws, stepmother, sisters-in\u00ad\nlaw and brother-in-law in Iraq continue to pose potential concerns for Applicant \nbecause of the risks of undue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or \nclassified information under Applicant\u2019s possession and/or control. Applicant has no \nprovided enough information about his family members to abate those concerns. \nAlthough none of Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq have any currently \nidentified Iraqi military or government service, or other demonstrated links to the Iraqi \ngovernment, they remain potentially vulnerable to pressure and coercion for so long \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas they reside in Iraq (even in places considered to be generally safe from terrorist \nthreats). Were any of these family members to be placed in a hostage situation, \nApplicant could be subject to conflicts over ensuring his family\u2019s well being and \nprotecting classified information. For this reason, DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information,\u201d is applicable to the facts of this case. \nApplicable, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation is DC \u00b6 7(f), \u201csubstantial business, \nfinancial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign-operated business \nthat could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s reported property interest in Iraq is \nconsiderable (last reported to be worth $620,000 and currently estimated by Applicant \nto be worth at least $450,000 based on current market conditions). His valued \nproperty in Iraq is still held and maintained by Applicant and far exceeds any reported \nproperty he has in the United States. \nTo be sure, none of Applicant\u2019s stepmother, in-laws, sisters-in-law and brother \nin-law residing in Iraq have any history to date of being subjected to any coercion or \ninfluence. These historical antecedents limit the risk of any potential conflict situation. \nAnd while the absence of any past coercive measures taken by Iraqi authorities does \nnot absolve Applicant from coercive risks in the future given Iraq\u2019s checkered history \nof political instability, violence, hostage taking, and abusive measures taken against \nits own citizens. Despite the absence of any known evidence of pressure or coercion \nin their family history, the potential risk of a potential hostage situation with Applicant\u2019s \nfamily members residing in Iraq is present. \nThe AGs governing security clearances do not dictate per se results or \nmandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines covering risks of foreign \ninfluence. What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not \nbe in another. While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be weighed \non a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing. Personnel security \nassessments necessarily embrace similar risk assessments under the new AGs for \nassessing foreign influence risks and concerns associated with the individual's having \nfamily abroad, which include both common sense assessments of country risks and \ninformation available from public sources. \nMitigation is partially available to Applicant under the foreign influence guideline \nof the AGs. Based on his case-specific circumstances, mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 \n8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n               \ngovernment and the interests of the United States.\u201d has some applicability to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. Reports about Applicant\u2019s family members residing in Iraq, as \nwell as substantial property interests in the country, and little information available to \nassess their status and prospects for sale of the property in the foreseeable future, \nmake it difficult to permit safe predictions about the future safety of Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers and risk projections about his ability to protect his property interests against \neconomic pressures brought to bear on Applicant by an Iraqi government interested in \ncompromising Applicant to acquire classified and sensitive information from him. \nOf some benefit to Applicant, too, is MC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the group, government, \nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s contributions to \nthe U.S. defense effort are sufficiently demonstrated in this record to warrant partial \napplication of MC \u00b6 8(b). \nStill, heightened security risks associated with Applicant\u2019s presumed close \nrelationships with his family members residing in Iraq and continued ownership of \nsignificant property interests in the country cannot be safely discounted, though, \nconsidering all the facts and circumstances associated with his ties to Iraq. His family \nrelationships and property interests in Iraq at this time are not fully reconcilable with \nhis holding a security clearance. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence risks to ascertain \nwhether they are fully compatible with eligibility requirements for holding a security \nclearance takes account of Applicant\u2019s immigration to the United States on an asylum \nvisa and his current employment as a linguist with the language skills he acquired in \nIraq. Applicant\u2019s value to U.S. security interests as a trained linguist is not sufficiently \ndeveloped in this record to enable him to surmount security concerns over the \nheightened risks that his family members and property interest in Iraq present to U.S. \nsecurity interests. Foreign influence concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, \nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following \nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance. \nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\n AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs  1.a-1.g: \n  Against Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n Conclusions \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 20-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n5 Tr. at 24, 44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7; AE A. \n \n6 Tr. at 24-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7; AE A, D, F, G. \n \n7 Tr. at 22, 35-36, 44-45, 68; AE F, G. \n \n8 Tr. at 36-37, 40, 65-69; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6; AE C, E-G. \n\n \n4 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n5 \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including two foreclosed properties, \na delinquent credit card debt, and unpaid taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s \nnon-tax \nfinancial \nproblems \nresulted \nfrom \nunemployment, \nunderemployment, renters who did not pay their rent, and the collapse of the real estate \nmarket. Those events were beyond his control. His tax problems were not.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s investment properties were lost to foreclosure in about 2014. There is \nno evidence of any deficiency balances owed on the properties. He paid and satisfied \nthe judgment for the debt alleged SOR \u00b6 1.d in September 2015. He also paid or settled \nseveral debts that were not alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant always worked as a salaried employee, and he was unsophisticated in \nthe tax requirements of independent contractors. He fell behind on his federal and state \nincome taxes, which raises some questions about his judgment. However, he started \naddressing the matter before the SOR was issued. All federal and state income taxes \nhave been paid. His current finances are in order. He credibly testified that he will \ncomply with his tax responsibilities in the future. \n \n \nApplicant had a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he implemented that \nplan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) are applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are partially \napplicable. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant responded to the SOR on September 28, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nThe case was assigned to me on January 11, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 29, 2019, \nscheduling the hearing for February 28, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were \nadmitted without objection.

She married again in 2011 and \ndivorced in 2016. She does not have children.1 \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. She filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ncase in 1991, and her debts were discharged in 1992. She admitted that the bankruptcy \nresulted from her financial irresponsibility. She and her first husband filed a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy case in 2001, and their debts were discharged the same year. Her first \nhusband handled the family\u2019s finances.

She withdrew the petition after he \npleaded with her that it could adversely affect his security clearance, and he agreed to \ngo to counseling.

She used credit cards to get back on \nher feet. She received her health insurance from her second husband. She has health \nproblems, and she had to start paying for her own health insurance. Her insurance \npremiums are high, and she has a large deductible. She missed a month of work \nbecause of her health, and she cared for her mother who has cancer. She was unable \nto maintain the credit card payments, and a number of debts became delinquent.4 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the two Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases, a $2,453 judgment, and \n12 delinquent debts totaling about $24,146. Applicant admitted owing all the debts, but \nshe stated that the judgment was paid through garnishment of her wages. She indicated \nthat the creditor for the $4,263 and $1,019 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.j obtained \na judgment and a garnishment order against her that was soon to go into effect. She \nalso stated that her federal income tax refund of about $500 was diverted toward the \nmilitary exchange account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The SOR debts are listed on a March \n2018 credit report.5  \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 16, 20, 22-23, 43-44; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 33-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6. \n \n3 Tr. at 16, 23; GE 1, 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 18-19, 26-27, 37, 41-43; GE 1, 2; AE C. \n \n5 Tr. at 26-33, 39-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant has worked a second job since November 2016. She lives frugally. She \ntraded her car in for a cheaper model. She lowered her cell phone and cable plans. She \nconsulted with an attorney who advised her to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. She \nwants to pay her debts, and insisted on a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. She paid the \nattorney\u2019s retainer, and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was filed on March 13, 2019. \nShe received financial counseling as a requirement of the bankruptcy. The monthly \npayment to the trustee will be $375. She indicated that she will keep her second job, \nand she will be able to make her monthly payments. She credibly testified that she will \ncontinue with the Chapter 13 bankruptcy until resolution. She also stated that she is \nwilling to provide the DOD with updates on the status of the bankruptcy.6 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a letter attesting to her excellent job performance at her \nsecond job. She is praised for her honesty, work ethic, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndependability, and integrity.7 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 18-22, 25, 43, 46-47; GE 1, 2; AE A, C, D. \n \n7 AE B.  \n\n \n4 \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including two bankruptcies and \nmultiple delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n5 \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control. \n \n \nThe bankruptcies in 1992 and 2001 are mitigated by time. Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial problems resulted when she left an abusive marriage with next to nothing. The \ndebts in the SOR were incurred in order for her to start over. With her health problems, \nhigh medical insurance premiums, and her mother\u2019s cancer, she was unable to maintain \nthe monthly credit card payments. \n \n \nApplicant obtained a second job, but it was still not enough to address her \nproblems. She consulted an attorney, but she disregarded the attorney\u2019s advice to file a \nChapter 7 case because she wanted to pay her debts. She paid the attorney and filed a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy case that will enable her to pay her debts through a structured \nplan approved by the bankruptcy court and monitored by the trustee. The plan calls for \nmonthly payments of $375, which she credibly stated she will maintain until completion.  \n \n \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but a trustworthiness \nadjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). I believe Applicant is honest and sincere in her intentions to \naddress her debts. I find that she has a plan to resolve her financial problems, and her \npayment of the attorney and filing a Chapter 3 bankruptcy case constitute actions to \nimplement that plan. Her financial difficulties were the result of conditions that were \nbeyond her control, and she acted responsibly under the circumstances. They do not \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) \nand 20(c) are applicable. AG \u00b6 20(a) is partially applicable. It may take time, but I am \nconvinced that she will eventually resolve her financial problems.8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n                                                          \n8 See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay. 31, 2011): \u201cDepending on the facts of a given case, the fact that an applicant\u2019s debts will not be paid \noff for a long time, in and of itself, may be of limited [trustworthiness] concern.\u201d \n\n \n6 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns.9  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nEdward W.

Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government opposes Applicant\u2019s request for access to sensitive information on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR. The Government alleges that Applicant in eligible for a public trust position because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR identified eleven delinquent debts totaling in excess of $230,000. Applicant admitted allegation 1.a., and denied the remaining allegations under this guideline. Credit reports of the Applicant dated August 10, 2010; August 12, 2016; and July 18, 2018, reflect that the debts are still owing. (Government Exhibits 4, 3 5, and 6.)

Henderson, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nFebruary 12, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStatement of Case \n \nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office \n(CHCSPO), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence \n(ASDC3I) entered into a memorandum of agreement for DOHA to provide \ntrustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed in Information \nSystems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated January of 1987.  (Superseded by DoD Manual 5200.02) \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on April 13, 2016.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  On September 4, 2018, the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD), issued an SOR detailing the trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline F Financial Considerations, and Guideline B Foreign Influence \nregarding Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n\n \n2 \n \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 24, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 29, 2018.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November \n15, 2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 6, 2018. The \nGovernment offered eight exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 8, \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered no exhibits at the hearing.  \nHe testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on \nDecember 20, 2018, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit supporting \ndocumentation.  Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A, which was admitted without objection.  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 17, 2018. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Department Counsel provided a 7 page \nsummary of the facts, supported by sixteen Government documents pertaining to Iran, \nidentified as HE I. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I \ntake administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They \nare limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are \nset out in the Findings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 60 years old.  He is unmarried with no children.  He has a Bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in Mathematics and a Doctorate of Chiropractic degree.  He is employed by the \nNavy and works on a Marine Corps base.  He is seeking access to sensitive information \nin connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government opposes Applicant\u2019s request for access to sensitive information \non the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following \nfindings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR. \n \nThe Government alleges that Applicant in eligible for a public trust position \nbecause he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds.  The SOR identified eleven delinquent debts totaling in excess of \n$230,000.  Applicant admitted allegation 1.a., and denied the remaining allegations \nunder this guideline.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated August 10, 2010; August 12, \n2016; and July 18, 2018, reflect that the debts are still owing.  (Government Exhibits 4, \n\n \n3 \n \n5, and 6.)  Applicant has worked for his current employer for the past two and a half \nyears.  He currently earns $125,000 annually. \n       \n \nApplicant has practiced as a chiropractor in various states throughout the country \nfor the past 30 years.  He explained that when he graduated from chiropractic school in \n1989, there were not very many good jobs available.  He made enough money to live \non, for rent, food and electricity, but not enough to pay his past due debts on any \nconsistent basis.  It was not until the last five or six years that his positon has really \nbecome stable.  He has not incurred any new debt over the past six to eight years.  \nApplicant testified that since 2012, he has been able to make good money and he is \nnow able to pay his delinquent debts.  The following debts became delinquent and \nowing: \n \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to the Government for student loans that were placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $185,575.  (Tr. p. 25 - 27.)             \n \n1.b.  Applicant is indebted to State A, for a tax lien entered against him in August 2013 \nin the approximate amount of $861.  Applicant stated that he made a payment in the \namount $1,200 about two weeks ago and was told that he owes nothing else.  (Tr. p. \n27.)  Applicant submitted no documentary evidence to support his contentions.     \n \n1.c.   Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $171.  Applicant stated that he has not addressed this debt yet.  \n(Tr. p. 29.)            \n \n1.d.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed in collection in \nthe approximate amount of $2,154.  Applicant stated that he has not addressed this \ndebt yet, nor has he attempted to contact the creditor.  (Tr. pp. 29 \u2013 30.)            \n \n1.e.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $1,590.  Applicant stated that he has no knowledge of the \ndebt, and has done nothing to resolve it.  (Tr. p. 30.)         \n \n1.f.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe in the approximate amount of $549.  Applicant stated that until he met with the OPM \ninvestigator on June 5, 2017, he did not know about the debt.  Since then, he has done \nnothing to resolve it.  (Tr. p. 30.)   \n \n1.g. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $500.  Applicant stated that he has not addressed this debt \nyet, nor has he attempted to contact the creditor.  (Tr. p. 31.)            \n \n1.h.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $99.  Applicant has done nothing to resolve the debt.  (Tr. p. \n31.)      \n \n\n \n4 \n \n1.i.   Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for a Federal tax lien filed against \nhim in June 2005 in the approximate amount of $41,534.   Applicant stated that he has \nbeen on the telephone with the IRS several times and has been told that he does not \nowe them anything.  (Tr. p. 31.)  He provided documentation from the IRS for tax years \n2006.  This does not show if he owes anything since then.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing \nExhibit A.)       \n \n1.j.  Applicant is indebted to State A, for a tax lien filed against him in August 2006, in \nthe approximate amount of $714.  (Government Exhibit 7.)   Applicant stated that he \nmade a payment in the amount $1,200 about two weeks ago, and was told that he owes \nnothing else.  (Tr. p. 27.)  Applicant submitted no documentary evidence to support his \ncontentions.     \n          \n1.k.  Applicant is indebted to State A, for a tax lien filed against him in February 1999, \nthen refiled in September 2002, in the approximate amount of $1,030.  (Government \nExhibit 8.)  Applicant stated that he made a payment in the amount $1,200 about two \nweeks ago, and was told that he owes nothing else.  (Tr. p. 27.)  Applicant submitted no \ndocumentary evidence to support his contentions.     \n \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \n \n  \nThe Government alleges that Applicant in eligible for a public trust position \nbecause he has foreign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, that are a national security concern if they result in \ndivided allegiance.  They may also be a national security concern if they create \ncircumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or \notherwise made vulnerable to pressure or coercions by any foreign interest.  \nAssessment of foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such \nhas whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nApplicant admits the allegation set forth under this guideline in the SOR.  His \ngirlfriend is a citizen and resident of Iran.  She works as an OBGYN physician in Iran.  In \nabout October 2016, he met her on an on-line computer website.  He saw her picture, \nsent her a message, and she messaged him back.  They started talking, and six months \nor so later, they met in Dubai.  (Tr. p. 34.)  Applicant talks with her daily by telephone or \nelectronically.  He has physically seen her a total of three times, and in mid-2017, they \nbecame engaged.  (Tr. p. 35.)  Her parents are retired. Her father used to work in a \nfactory.  He does not know where her mother worked if she did.  His girlfriend has two \nsisters, who are dentists.  One sister lived in Dubai for a while, and now lives in Iran.  \nHer husband is the dean of the dental college there.  The other sister left Iran, and now \nlives in Copenhagen.  (Tr. p. 36.)  Her husband is also a dentist.  (Tr. p. 37.)  Applicant\u2019s \ngirlfriend is currently in the process of moving to Dubai.  She has taken her medical \nlicensing examination and already has a job lined up with a hospital there.  (Tr. p. 38.)   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the information set forth in the Government\u2019s \nbrief on the Islamic Republic of Iran.  Iran is known to target the United States to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information, and is associated with a risk of terrorism.  Of all the \ncountries in the world, Iran remains the most prominent sponsor of terrorism, providing \nfinancial aid, advanced weapons and tactics, and direction to militant and terrorist \ngroups across the Middle East and cultivating a network of operative across the globe \nas a contingency to enable potential terrorist attacks.  The United States does not have \ndiplomatic or consular relations with Iran.  The Department of State warns U.S. citizens \nnot to travel to Iran due to the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention noting that there is a \nvery high risk of arrest and detention of U.S. citizens, particularly U.S. \u2013 Iranian dual \nnationals.  Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens on \ncharges including espionage and posing a threat to national security.  (HE 1.)     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n\n \n6 \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal , state or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial distress.  He is excessively indebted to \nvarious creditors that include delinquent student loans, state and Federal tax liens, and \nother miscellaneous debt totally approximately $230,000.  The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;    \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n  \nApplicant testified that after graduating from chiropractic school, he was unable \nto find stable employment that paid him enough to pay his bills.  He only started making \ngood money in 2012 or so, that would allow him to address his delinquent debts.  Even \nso, he did not resolve them.  He has not made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.  \nHe stated that he has paid his state and Federal tax liens.  He has provided no \ndocumentary evidence from the state tax authorities that show he has paid the debts.  \nHe has submitted a document from the IRS, showing that he owes nothing for tax year \n2006.  He has provided nothing else.  Applicant has done little to show that he can or \nwill resolve his debts.  He did not contact the creditors in the SOR to set up a payment \nplan that he is following.  Knowing that the Government was concerned about his \nfinancial indebtedness, he did not even pay off a smaller debt for $99 that is set forth in \nthe SOR that remains owing.  Most of the delinquent debt set forth in the SOR remain \nowing.  For over 30 years Applicant practiced as a chiropractor and did not act \nresponsibly toward his delinquent debt.  Now he states that he is going to resolve the \ndebt, but it is too late.  In this case, none of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  \nThere is no clear evidence in the record that he has acted reasonably and responsibly.  \nHis actions reflect unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. The record fails \nto establish sufficient mitigation of financial trustworthiness concerns under the \nprovisions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(g). \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \n\n \n8 \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7.  Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend is a citizen and resident of Iran. Applicant does not know her \nwell.  He met her through an on-line computer website.  He has physically seen her on \nthree occasions.  He is now engaged to marry her.  The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend poses a significant security risk to the \nUnited States.  His girlfriend is from a nation that is of great concern to the United \nStates.  Applicant\u2019s infrequent contact with his girlfriend is troubling in that Applicant has \nlimited information about her.  Yet, he is engaged to marry her.  Under the \ncircumstances, he does not have sufficient information about her to establish that she \ndoes not pose a significant security risk to the United States.  There is insufficient \nmitigation here.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline  \nB (Foreign Influence).   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a position of trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a mature adult, \n\n \n10 \n \nwho has failed to demonstrate that he can live within his means, budget his income \naccordingly, and pay his bills in a timely fashion.  At this point, his financial problems \ncontinue as there is no evidence that they have been resolved.   \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, eligibility, and suitability for a public trust position.  He has not met his burden \nto mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising under the guidelines for Financial \nConsiderations and Foreign Influence. \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a public trust position for \nthe Applicant. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g., and 1.k. through 1.n. He denied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. through 1.j. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 14 line 4 to page 15 line 5, and GX 1 at pages 5 and 15.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since March of 2016, but he does not currently have a security clearance. (Id.) Applicant served in the Marine Corps from 2008~2013. (TR at page 14 line 11 to page 15 line 23, and GX 1 at page 25.) He was deployed \u201cto Iraq in 2009,\u201d and \u201cto Afghanistan in 2010 to 2011.\u201d (Id.) As a result, he receives 70% compensation from the Veterans Administration. (TR at page 15 lines 2-~23.) Applicant received an Honorable Discharge. (GX 1 at page 26.)

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 24, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on October 25, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non November 14, 2018, scheduling the hearing for December 4, 2018. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was left \nopen until January 4, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation. Applicant presented  \n11 documents, which Applicant marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through N (AppX \n\n \n2 \n \nH~K is one and the same document addressing four past-due debts to the same \ncreditor). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on December 13, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g., and 1.k. \nthrough 1.n. He denied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. through 1.j. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 14 line \n4 to page 15 line 5, and GX 1 at pages 5 and 15.) He has been employed with the \ndefense contractor since March of 2016, but he does not currently have a security \nclearance. (Id.) Applicant served in the Marine Corps from 2008~2013. (TR at page 14 \nline 11 to page 15 line 23, and GX 1 at page 25.) He was deployed \u201cto Iraq in 2009,\u201d \nand \u201cto Afghanistan in 2010 to 2011.\u201d (Id.) As a result, he receives 70% compensation \nfrom the Veterans Administration. (TR at page 15 lines 2-~23.) Applicant received an \nHonorable Discharge. (GX 1 at page 26.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant attributes his current financial difficulties to a divorce in 2012, and \nperiods of unemployment in 2013 and in 2014. (TR at page 15 line 9 to page 19 line 2.) \n \n \n1.a.~1.d., 1.f., and 1.k.~1.n. Applicant admits that he has past-due debts to eight \ndifferent creditors totaling about $20,121. (TR at page 19 at line 23 to page 23 line 8, at \npage 26 line 7 to page 33 line 2, and at page 35 line 14 to page 36 line 19.) On New \nYear\u2019s Eve, four months after the issuance of the SOR, Applicant sent the following two \nline, letter request to each of these creditors. (AppXs a~d, f, and k~n.) In each letter he \nsimply requested the following: \u201cthis letter is being sent to you to request information on \nmy account. I would like to be sent a statement with current amount due and minimum \nmonthly payment options to be able to resolve this credit account.\u201d (Id.) Applicant\u2019s \nrecent requests, though laudable, are too little too late. He has had years to address \nthese known delinquencies that remain outstanding. These allegations are found \nagainst Applicant.  \n \n \n1.e. Applicant has paid the alleged $35 past-due debt to Creditor E, as evidenced \nby correspondence with Creditor E. (TR at page 34 line 17 to page 35 line 13, and AppX \nE.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.g. Applicant successfully disputed an alleged $14,257 past-due debt to Creditor \nG; and as such, it does not appear on the Government\u2019s two most recent 2018 credit \nreports. (TR at page 24 line 16 to page 26 line 6, and GXs 4 and 5.) This allegation is \nfound for Applicant. \n \n \n1.h.~1.j. Applicant successfully disputed three alleged past-due debts, totaling \nabout $3,104, to Creditor H; and as such, they do not appears on the Government\u2019s two \n\n \n3 \n \nmost recent 2018 credit reports. (TR at page 23 line 9 to page 24 line 15, and GXs 4 \nand 5.) These allegations are found for Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing and continuing. He has a long history \nof delinquencies, and significant past-due indebtedness that he has only recently begun \nto address, through  simple two sentence letters requesting \u201cinformation.\u201d He has clearly \nnot demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 \nhas not been established. Guideline F is found against Applicant. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g.-1.j.: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k.-1.n.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Resulting security concerns were not \nmitigated. Based upon a review of the pleadings, and exhibits, national security \neligibility is denied. \nHistory of Case \nOn August 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented June 8, 2017.  \n03/04/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR, denying the sole allegation, on \nSeptember 11, 2018, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu \nof a hearing. Department Counsel submitted its file of relevant material (FORM) on \nOctober 24, 2018. Applicant received it on November 6, 2018. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 7. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant submitted an email with an \nattached credit report dated November 27, 2018, as his response to the FORM \n(Response). Items 1 through 7 and the Response are admitted into the record. The \ncase was assigned to me on February 11, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen. He is married and has two \nchildren. He has worked for a government contractor since February 2011. He served \non active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1984 to 2007, when he retired honorably. He \ndenied the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Answer; Item 4.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was indebted to a mortgage holder in the \namount of $296,546. This debt was reflected on his May 2017 and July 2018 credit \nreports as a charged-off account. (Item 5; Item 6.) Records reflect Applicant purchased \na condominium in 2005 for $379,000, for his daughter to reside in while Applicant was \nstationed overseas. He financed the purchase with a $303,192 fixed-rate loan from \nlender 1 and a flexible-rate loan of $75,798 from lender 2. Lender 1 apparently sold the \ndebt for collection (or transferred the mortgage) to the creditor identified in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nIn July 2011, Applicant purchased his current residence for approximately $369,900 \nfinanced through a different lender. He then decided he wanted to sell the condominium \nhe bought for his daughter to reside in. He explained in his Answer: \n \nDuring the real estate down market in 2011, with the assistance of a Real \nEstate Agent, I attempted to sell my condominium located at [address \nomitted]. However, the bank refused to settle and instead foreclosed the \nproperty and sold it to the highest bidder. (Answer.) \n \n \nHe attached a property profile for the condominium, which showed that the \nproperty was sold through foreclosure in November 2012 for $180,000. (Answer.) The \nrecord does not allege or reflect the status of the home loan made by lender 2. \n \n \nIn his Response, Applicant attached a recent credit report, which shows he has \nan excellent credit rating. He indicated \u201cthe foreclosure, which will not happen again, \noccurred a long time ago (seven (7) years to be exact) due to the real estate down \nmarket.\u201d (Response.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each \nguideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which \nare used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so. \n \nAs alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s mortgage account was charged off by the \ncreditor in the approximate amount of $296,546. His decision to purchase another \nproperty and let this property fall into foreclosure was a strategic decision and reflected \nan unwillingness to abide by his financial obligation to the creditor. These facts establish \nprima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying condition, and shift the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial difficulties:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose as a result of a strategic default on his \nmortgage. While the decline of his home value may have initially caused difficulties \nselling the property, he did not present evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. While he attempted to sell his condominium, he also purchased another \nhome just prior to his choice to default on his condominium mortgage. Applicant\u2019s \ndefault on his mortgage loan shows financial irresponsibility. While he has an excellent \ncredit score, he has done little to show that similar lapses in judgment are unlikely to \noccur. Mitigation was not established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b). \n \nApplicant offered no evidence of financial counseling, or budget information. \nAlthough his 2018 credit report indicates he is responsibly paying his current debts, \nwhich is evidence of partial mitigation, he failed to overcome his past questionable \ndecision to strategically default on his condominium mortgage. Accordingly, Applicant \nestablished limited mitigation of financial security concerns under the provisions of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, \nwho is accountable for his choices to incur substantial debt and not repay it. He is \ncredited with his military service. However, he has not demonstrated responsible action \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nunder the circumstances, and he has not documented a good-faith effort to resolve his \nmortgage debt.

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Statement of the Case \n \nOn January 25, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). On August 31, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \n \n \nOn September 14, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. He submitted a student loan payment receipt \n\n \n2 \n \n \nand a credit report with his SOR response. On February 28, 2019, the case was \nassigned to me. On March 5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing, setting the hearing for March 20, 2019.  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4 into evidence, which I admitted without objection. Applicant testified and \noffered four documents, Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D into evidence, which I \nadmitted without objection. I held the record open for one month in the event either \nparty wanted to submit additional documentation. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on April 1, 2019. Neither party provided additional records, and the record was \nclosed on April 20, 2019.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 33 years old. He never \nmarried and does not have any children. In 2015, he earned an associate\u2019s degree in \ncomputer information systems. He was unemployed from October 2010 until June 2015. \nHis current employer, a Federal contractor, hired him in February 2017 as a scanning \ntechnician. The employer hires individuals with disabilities, and Applicant\u2019s disability is \nfor his condition diagnosed as autism. This is Applicant\u2019s first time application for a \nposition of public trust. (Tr. 15-18)  \n \nApplicant was not employed while he attended school. His mother financially \nsupported him during this time. Despite his mother\u2019s financial assistance, Applicant\u2019s \nlong period of unemployment caused him to accumulate delinquent debt.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.c-1.f allege five student loan accounts placed for collection in \nthe total amount of about $20,000. He admitted these allegations in his SOR response. \nApplicant was not aware that his student loans were delinquent until he had his \nbackground interview in March 2018. Since September 2018, he has made consistent \npayments in varying amounts, between $200-to-$500 a month. He missed one payment \nduring the Government shutdown, while the payment system was not in operation. (Tr. \n18-21, GE 2, GE 4; AE A, AE C)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.i allege two delinquent medical accounts totaling about \n$5,400. Applicant admitted both accounts in his response to the SOR. These accounts \nstem from his five-day hospital admission in May 2015. He had insurance during this \ntime, but the accounts reflect the remainder amount he was responsible to pay. \nApplicant has not yet paid these accounts, but it is his intention to pay these accounts in \nthe near future. (Tr. 23-25; GE 2)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a past-due credit card account in the amount of $338, with a \ntotal balance of $1,096. Applicant admitted this debt. He was recently offered a \nsettlement from the creditor, and it is his intention to pay this debt within the next month \nor two. (Tr. 22-23; GE 2) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a past-due credit card account in the amount of $541. \nApplicant admitted this debt, and he provided a document at the hearing showing he \npaid the account in full in December 2018. (Tr. 23; GE 2; AE D) \n \n SOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a past-due account in the amount of $73. Applicant admitted \nthis debt, but at the hearing, he denied any knowledge of this debt. He has not received \nany letters from any creditor for $73. He researched this account, but he was unable to \ndiscover if the debt belonged to him, or determine the original creditor. If he finds that he \nis responsible for this account, it is his intention to pay it. (Tr. 25-26) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges a collection account in the amount of $294. Applicant originally \ndenied this account in his response to the SOR, but at the hearing, he admitted this \naccount belonged to him. When he researched this account, he discovered it was for \ncable service that he did not pay. It is his intention to pay this account in full in the near \nfuture. (Tr. 26) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a past-due account placed for collection in the amount of \n$2,783. Applicant denied this debt in his response to the SOR. He believed this account \nstemmed from 2011 when he and his mother co-signed an apartment lease. His mother \nunexpectedly became unemployed, Applicant was unemployed, and they broke the \nlease. His mother told him that she had paid this account. It was Applicant\u2019s intention to \ndiscuss this account with his mother and determine whether this account had been paid \nin full. (Tr. 26-27) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a past due account in the amount of $450, for an unpaid \nutility account. Applicant denied this debt because he did not recognize this account. He \nhas not received any letters or phone calls from this creditor. He tried to do some \nresearch into this account, but he was unable to find if the debt belonged to him, or \nlocate the creditor. If he finds that he is responsible for this account, it is his intention to \npay it. (Tr. 28; GE 2) \n \nApplicant has not participated in financial counseling, but he does maintain a \nstrict monthly budget. He has saved money and recently opened a savings account. He \ndoes not have any new delinquent debt and he is current on all of his expenses. He files \nall of his tax returns timely. In order to save money, Applicant does not own a car and \ntakes the bus instead. \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor submitted a character reference letter. His \nsupervisor disclosed that Applicant\u2019s employer is a nonprofit company dedicated to \nemploying individuals with disabilities. He found Applicant to be sincere and honest, \ndespite that he struggles greatly with his autism. Applicant is dependable and makes \nsensible decisions on the job. His supervisor views Applicant\u2019s employment as a \nsuccess story. (AE B) \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable determination may \nbe made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.1 Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.2 An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \nshifts to the Government.3 An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \n                                                          \n1 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n2 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n3 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n  \n AG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence of record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n  \n \nApplicant experienced financial difficulties due to prolonged unemployment from \n2010 to 2015. He was enrolled in classes while his mother supported him during the \nmajority of this time period. The circumstances which resulted in Applicant\u2019s financial \n\n \n6 \n \n \nproblems were not completely beyond his control. Applicant chose to devote his time to \nschool instead of looking for a job, or working for an employer. However, I find these \nparticular set of circumstances are unlikely to recur. Once Applicant received his \nassociate\u2019s degree, he found full-time employment.  \n \n \nApplicant did not realize he was delinquent in paying his student loans until his \nMarch 2018 background interview. Since September 2018, he has made consistent \nstudent loan payments, ranging from $200-to-$500 each month. In addition, he paid off \na delinquent credit card account. He has stated his intention to pay another credit card \naccount and a cable bill in the near future. Applicant has made sufficient progress \ntowards resolving his financial accounts, and demonstrated a good-faith effort to repay \ndelinquent creditors. Although he has not participated in financial counseling, Applicant \nis taking action to prevent additional delinquencies with a firm monthly budget. He \nrecently demonstrated financial responsibility by opening a new savings account in the \nevent there is an unplanned emergency. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a), (b), (c) and \n(d) apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has made consistent student loan \npayments after he discovered he was delinquent. He repaid a delinquent credit card \naccount, and took responsible action with his budget in an effort to pay off his remaining \ncreditors. He provided a favorable character reference letter from his direct supervisor. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without doubts or concerns as to Applicant\u2019s \ngood judgment, reliability, and suitability for a position of public trust with the \nGovernment.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 27, 2016, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On a May 9, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories. He \nresponded to those interrogatories on June 14, 2018. On September 28, 2018, the DOD \nCAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive \nposition, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated November 8, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated \nthe Government was prepared to proceed on December 20, 2018. The case was \nassigned to me on January 10, 2019. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 13, 2019. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on April 3, 2019. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE F were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 15, 2019. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity                    \nand timely submitted additional documents which were marked and admitted into \nevidence as AE O through AE X without objection. The record closed on May 3, 2019. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDuring the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend \nthe SOR to correct what he identified as an administrative or clerical error to conform to \nthe expected evidence in the record. The motion was to amend SOR \u00b6 1.b, by deleting \nthe number $19,071.29, and substituting therefor the number $28,703.35.

He generally referred to various situations with some \nfinancial significance to him, but he does not claim that they caused him not to timely file \nhis federal income tax returns or to have insufficient funds to pay any of his debts. They \nwere simply alternative ways to spend his money. For example, he mentioned taking a \nsabbatical or temporary retirement at the age of 50; a year of sailing from Michigan around \nthe Gulf of Mexico to various locations in Florida; family medical issues; there was a stock \nmarket \u201csetback;\u201d being disorganized; he lost or misplaced all of his records for the tax \nyear 2012 during a move in 2013; his parents died in 2016; there was a hurricane in \nOctober 2018; he purchased some property for an autistic grandson; and he and his wife \nhave paid for, and attended, various real estate investment programs to create a business \nfor a decent retirement income.3 While Applicant mentioned those factors, he submitted \nno specific information or documents to indicate in what way they were largely beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control; and what impact they may have had on his finances and actions \nrelative thereto. \n \n (SOR \u00b6 1.a.): When it was time for Applicant to file his federal income tax return \nfor the tax year 2012, he timely filed for an extension, and he sent the IRS an estimated \npayment of $1,397. The IRS granted the extension until October 15, 2013.4 During the \nextension period, Applicant was unable to locate the necessary supporting \ndocumentation, such as his W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, and other documents, and \nhe eventually failed to timely file his income tax return by the end of the extension period.5 \n                                                          \n2 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: GE 2 (e-QIP, dated July 27, 2016); GE 4 (Answers to Interrogatories, dated June 14, \n2018); GE 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview (ESI), dated September 14, 2017); AE A (Statement, dated April \n3, 2019); AE H (Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Account Transcript \u2013 2013, dated October 3, 2016); AE F \n(IRS Account Transcript, dated June 4, 2018); AE J (IRS Account Transcript \u2013 2015 (IRS Account \nTranscript, dated June 1, 2018); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated November 8, 2018. \n  \n3 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 2; GE 3, supra note 2, at 5; AE A, supra note 2; Tr. at \n30, 38-39.

Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, the \nfollowing applies: \n \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title \nor by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or \nsupply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such \nreturn, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law \nor regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 \n($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, \ntogether with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom \nthere is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with \nrespect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect \nto such failure.

In April 2019, six \nand one-half years after the extended due date for the filing, and over six months after \nthe SOR was issued, Applicant reported that he was able to obtain a copy of his W-2. He \nclaimed that he finally sent his federal income tax return for the tax year 2012 to the IRS \nduring the week of the April 2019 hearing.7 Applicant did not submit a copy of the subject \nfederal income tax return to support his claim that it had finally been filed. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file his \nfederal income tax return for the tax year 2013.8 An official Account Transcript from the \nIRS reflects that Applicant failed to file his 2013 income tax return until March 2015, one \nyear after it was required to be filed.9 Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income during the tax \nyear 2013 was reported to be $186,348. During the period 2014 through early 2017, the \nIRS issued several notices to Applicant, assessed penalties, additional taxes, and \ninterest, and eventually issued a levy. In April 2017, an Installment Agreement was \nestablished under which Applicant agree to have $700 per month automatically withdrawn \nfrom his bank account. Because of some incorrect bank account information, monthly \nwithdrawals were attempted but promptly cancelled. As of June 4, 2018, Applicant\u2019s tax \nbalance plus accruals was $28,703.35.10 In October 2018 \u2013 approximately one month \nafter the SOR was issued \u2013 Applicant agreed to a new Installment Agreement, restarting \nthe $700 monthly withdrawals. As of April 2, 2019, the unpaid balance for 2013 has been \nreduced to $26,936.90.11 The 2013 delinquencies are finally in the process of being \nresolved. \n                                                          \nsentence of this section shall be applied by substituting \"felony\" for \"misdemeanor\" and \"5 \nyears\" for \"1 year.\" \n  \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax. \n \n6 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 2; AE A, supra note 2; GE 4 (Answers to \nInterrogatories), supra note 2, at 2. \n \n7 AE A, supra note 2; Tr. at 28, 30-31. \n \n8 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard.

In April 2017, the Installment \nAgreement described above was established, but eventually terminated. Although the \nnew Installment Agreement was established in October 2018, restarting the monthly \nwithdrawals, priority has been given to the resolution of unpaid 2013 taxes while \nApplicant\u2019s unpaid 2014 taxes wait in line with the unpaid balance increasing. In March \n2019, Applicant\u2019s unpaid 2014 balance was $15,294.48,14 and on April 2, 2019, it had \nincreased to $15,344.15.15 The 2014 delinquencies are not yet in the process of being \nresolved. \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.): Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file his \nfederal income tax return for the tax year 2015, claiming that when he received IRS \nnotification regarding his tax issues for the tax years 2012 through 2014, he \u201cwas flustered \n. . . and forgot to file or pay.\u201d16 An official Account Transcript from the IRS reflects that \nApplicant failed to file his 2015 income tax return until November 2016, one month after \nit was required to be filed if an extension request had been made, or six months after the \noriginal due date.17 In this instance, there is no evidence that Applicant requested an \nextension. Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income during the tax year 2015 was reported to \nbe $132,246. During the period late 2016 through early 2017, the IRS issued several \nnotices to Applicant, assessed penalties and interest, and eventually issued a levy.

Of the nine accounts listed, the IRS holds the least priority, and it \nhas him scheduled to continue making monthly $700 payments over the next five years, \nwith three final balloon payments of nearly $4,000 commencing in December 2023.23 He \nnoted that such a plan does not interfere with his 401(k) contributions, and it allows him \nto retire again in five years as previously planned.24  \nApproximately five years ago, Applicant met with a financial planner to set up an \nannuity for his eventual retirement.25 While he claimed to have a three-ring binder of \npaperwork from his financial planner, Applicant did not specify or identify any of the \ndocuments, and, although he was asked to submit such information, and indicated that \nhe would do so, he failed to submit any documentation to indicate the nature of the \nfinancial counseling that he received. In addition, Applicant stated that he is now working \nwith a different financial planner, since his first one passed away, and they are reviewing \nApplicant\u2019s retirement plans to make sure they are sound, and Applicant does not incur \nany additional tax burdens as a result of turning 70 and one-half.26 There is some \nevidence to indicate that Applicant\u2019s financial situation, with respect to his federal income \ntaxes, is now under better control.  \nWork Performance and Character References \n \nThe current project manager of the program in which Applicant works, has known \nand worked with Applicant since 2005.

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d30   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d31 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \n                                                          \n27 AE B (Character Reference, dated March 16, 2019). \n \n28 AE M (Character Reference, dated July 19, 2018). \n \n29 Department of the Navy v.

Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.32  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d33  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d34 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n                                                          \n32 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n33 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n34 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n                                      \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income      \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2012 (as \nwell as for the tax year 2015); failed to pay annual federal income taxes as required for a \nmulti-year period; and currently owes the IRS approximately $51,757 in unpaid federal \nincome taxes, interest, and penalties. The failure to timely file income tax returns has \nsecurity implications because:35 \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \n                                                          \n35 ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

As for the unpaid 2013, \n2014, and 2015 income taxes, Applicant waited until April 2017 to establish an Installment \nAgreement (that was eventually terminated because of incorrect information), and then \nreestablished in October 2018 \u2013 approximately one month after the SOR was issued \u2013 \nrestarting $700 monthly withdrawals. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been \nestablished. As there is no evidence that Applicant was unwilling to satisfy his debts \nregardless of the ability to do so, AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;38 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n                                                          \n \n36 See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, \nno foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis \nas inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax \nreturns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \n37 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \n \n38 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;39  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is compliance with those arrangements.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) partially apply, but none of the remaining mitigating \nconditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties make it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d \nor that it is \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d While Applicant generally referred to various situations with \nsome financial significance to him, he does not claim that they caused him not to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns or to have insufficient funds to pay his federal income \ntaxes. They were simply alternative ways to spend his money. Taking a sabbatical at the \nage of 50; spending a year of sailing around the Gulf of Mexico; and seeking alternative \navenues of funds for retirement, do not qualify as being largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. \nBeing disorganized seems to be Applicant\u2019s major problem with regard to his federal \nincome tax issues. Losing or misplacing all of his records for the tax year 2012 during a \nmove in 2013 does not explain his failure to file his 2012 federal income tax return until \n2019. Other than the ineffective and terminated Installment Agreement that was \nestablished in 2017, Applicant essentially made little meaningful efforts to file his income \ntax return for the tax year 2012 or make voluntarily good-faith payments to reduce his \noutstanding 2013 through 2015 income tax balances until after he was seemingly \nmotivated to do so by the issuance of the SOR.  \nThe Appeal Board previously observed that:40 \n \n                                                          \n39 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n40 ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018) (quoting ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-\n4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018). \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n[t]he mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment \narrangement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to \nissue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating \ncondition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide whether \nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. \nThe timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the Judge to \nconsider in the application of [pertinent mitigating conditions]. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests.41 Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.42 \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.  \n \nMere promises to pay debts in the future, without further confirmed action, are \ninsufficient. In this instance, Applicant\u2019s evidence of self-reformation and self-\nrehabilitation to voluntarily comply with the tax filing requirements in the future fail to \nremove the lingering doubts that remain whether he has demonstrated the judgment, \nreliability, and willingness to abide by well-established rules and regulations that is \nrequired for granting a security clearance.43 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n                                                          \n41 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n42 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n43 See ISCR Case No. 17-01256, supra note 39, at 5. \n\n13 \n                                      \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.44  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 70-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor, serving under a variety of titles with his current \nemployer since December 2005. A 1966 high school graduate, he received an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 1974. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in April 1968, and he was honorably \ndischarged in October 1969 with a pre-existing physical disability. He was granted a \nsecret clearance in October 2006. His project manager and a coworker both think highly \nof him, and they essentially describe him as honest, dependable, professional, and a very \nvalued friend, confidant, and a dedicated colleague. Applicant may have eventually filed \nboth of his late federal income tax returns, and he may now be properly motivated to \ntimely file federal income tax returns in the future. There is no evidence of any security \nviolations. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for a multi-year period; failed to \npay annual federal income taxes as required; and currently owes approximately $51,757 \nin unpaid federal income taxes, interest, and penalties. He waited six and one-half years \nafter the extended due date for the filing, and over six months after the SOR was issued, \nto supposedly file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2012, during the week of \nthe April 2019 hearing. As for the unpaid 2013, 2014, and 2015 income taxes, Applicant \nwaited until October 2018 to establish a working Installment Agreement with the IRS \u2013 \napproximately one month after the SOR was issued \u2013 starting $700 monthly withdrawals. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial focus is on his second retirement, five years from now, \nand his repayment plans reflect that paying his unpaid federal income taxes is low on his \nlisted priorities. When an issue involving taxes arises, it is proper to consider how long an \napplicant waits to file their tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt \narises to begin and complete making payments. The primary concern in this instance is \nthat Applicant has repeatedly been late filing his federal income tax returns, and while he \noffered some explanations for his actions, those explanations do not adequately justify \nthe lengthy delays in completing the required actions. Under the circumstances described \n                                                          \n44 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nabove, I am unable to reach a positive conclusion pertaining to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:45 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of both debt reduction \nand elimination efforts and in his efforts to timely file his federal income tax returns, \nseemingly avoiding doing so until he was alerted that his eligibility for a security clearance \nhad become an issue. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n                                                          \n45 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 18, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 4, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April 1, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on April 19, 2019. The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 3. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. There were no \n\n2 \nobjections to any of the exhibits offered, and they were admitted into evidence. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on April 30, 2019.  \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel submitted Hearing Exhibit I, a written request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about Afghanistan. Applicant did not object, and I \nhave taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the request that are supported \nby source documents from official U.S. Government publications.1 The facts are \nsummarized in the Findings of Fact, below.   \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 63 years old. He was born in Afghanistan. He married in 1976. His \nwife passed away in 2001. He has eight children. All of them were born in Afghanistan. \nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in Afghanistan. He served in the Afghan National Army \nfrom 1974 to 1997. He was a Major. In 1997, he abandoned his Army commitment and \nfled the country with his family, because the Taliban invaded the area where he worked, \nand he was concerned for their safety. He moved his family to Turkmenistan in 1998, \nwhere they lived until 2005. He and his family were granted refugee visas and moved to \nthe United States. His eldest daughter was married at the time and moved back to \nAfghanistan with her husband, who is a linguist for the government of Turkey. She is a \nhomemaker. She and her husband are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. They have \nsix children. Applicant visited his daughter in 2015 and talks on the phone with her \nfrequently. Applicant\u2019s seven children, who immigrated to the United States with him, are \nall citizens and residents of the United States. Three children are married. Their spouses \nare from Afghanistan and permanent residents of the United States. He has six \ngrandchildren in the United States.2  \nApplicant became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2014. From 2005 to \n2010, he worked as a linguist and cultural advisor in the United States for different \ncontractors. From January 2010 to June 2014, Applicant worked as a linguist for a federal \ncontractor in Afghanistan. He was then an on-call temporary linguist and advisor from \nJune 2014 until he was hired again full time in June 2017 as a linguist working in \nAfghanistan until the present.3  \n1 Source documents are attached to Hearing Exhibit I. \n2 Tr. 12, 21-30, 40-53, 66-68; GE 2. \n3 Tr. 30-33. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother and two sisters are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. \nApplicant did not see his brother from 1997 until 2015. He occasionally contacted him by \ntelephone. His brother is married and has eight children. Applicant is \u201cfriends\u201d with some \nof them on Facebook and will occasionally \u201clike\u201d their posts. His brother works for the \nAfghan government. Applicant also visited his two sisters in 2015. Both sisters are \nmarried and are homemakers. One sister\u2019s husband is a custodian. The other sister\u2019s \nhusband is a retired custodian. He is not in regular contact with them. He does not discuss \nhis job with them.4  \n \n \nApplicant does not own property or have any assets in Afghanistan. He owns a car \nin the United States. He helped his family purchase a house in March 2010, by giving \nthem $32,000. Two of his children and their families live in the house. Applicant lives there \nwhen he is in the United States. Applicant has approximately $100,000 in his bank \naccounts in the United States. He does not provide any financial support to anyone in \nAfghanistan.5 \n \n \nApplicant explained that when he is in Afghanistan he lives on the U.S. military \nbase. He is not permitted to leave the base due to safety concerns. He was involved in \npatrols outside of the base for a few months. He understands the danger of serving with \nthe American forces. He testified that he has spent many years working with the United \nStates military and is happy with his job. He considers himself a loyal American and would \nnever engage in any activity that would compromise himself or the United States.6 \n \n \nApplicant provided certificates of appreciation from United States and NATO forces \nfor his unwavering commitment in support of their missions and his outstanding \nperformance and professionalism that contributed to their success. He also provided \ncharacter letters noting his past contributions as a role player and linguist.7 \n \nAfghanistan8 \n \n \nThe United States Department of State\u2019s travel warning for Afghanistan remains in \neffect and it warns U.S. citizens against travel there because of continued instability and \nthreats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Travel there is unsafe due to \nongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, and armed rivalry \nbetween political and tribal groups, militant attacks, suicide bombings, and insurgent \nattacks. These attacks may also target Afghan and U.S. Government convoys and \ncompounds, foreign embassies, military installations, and other public areas.  \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 34-40, 50-52, 54. \n \n5 Tr. 54, 58-62. \n \n6 Tr. 70-72; GE 2.  \n \n7 AE A. \n \n8 HE I. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAs recently as December 2018, The U.S. Embassy in Kabul warned U.S. citizens \nin Afghanistan of reports that militants plan to conduct attacks against hotels, compounds, \ninternational organizations, universities, airports and other locations frequented by U.S. \ncitizens and other foreign nationals.  \n \nExtremists associated with various Taliban networks, the Islamic State in Iraq and \nSyria (ISIS), and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the \ncountry. These terrorist groups routinely attack Afghan, coalition forces, and U.S. targets \nwith little regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties. Due to security \nconcerns, unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. Government employees and their family \nmembers is restricted and requires prior approval from the State Department.  \n \nAfghanistan continues to experience aggressive and coordinated attacks by \ndifferent terrorist groups. These groups remain active and were able to conduct a number \nof high-profile, mass-casualty attacks in Kabul against sectarian and Afghan government \ntargets. They continue to plan such attacks against U.S. and coalition forces and Afghan \ninterests. Border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan remain safe havens for terrorists. \nThe Afghan government struggles to assert control over this remote region.  \n \nAccording to a June 2017 U.S. Department of Defense report on Afghanistan, \nAfghanistan faces a continuing threat from as many as 20 insurgent and terrorist networks \npresent and operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, in what is the highest \nconcentration of extremist and terrorist groups in the world. \n \n \nThe State Department\u2019s report on human rights for Afghanistan notes there was \nwidespread violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and killings of persons \naffiliated with the government by armed insurgent groups, widespread disregard for the \nrule of law and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses. There \nwas also targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls.  \n \n \nAfghanistan remains an important partner of the United States in the fight against \nterrorism, working with the U.S. to eliminate terrorist groups. The U.S. Government \ncontinues to invest resources to help Afghanistan improve its security, governance, \ninstitutions, and economy. The U.S. Government has a strong bilateral partnership with \nthe Afghan government. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \n\n \n6 \n \n \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise this disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes \na risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a \nforeign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  \n \nApplicant has a daughter, son-in-law, brother, and two sisters and their spouses \nwho are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. His brother works for the Afghan \ngovernment. Applicant has ties of affection to them. He has infrequent contact with his \nbrother and sisters, but has frequent contact with his daughter. Applicant\u2019s family residing \nin Afghanistan creates a heightened risk and a potential foreign influence concern.  \n \nThe United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to \nAfghanistan because of continued instability and threats by terrorist organizations against \nU.S. citizens. It also has serious concerns about terrorist activities in Afghanistan that \nspecifically target Americans. There are widely documented safety issues for residents of \nAfghanistan because of terrorists and insurgents. Applicant has supported the U.S. \nGovernment through his work as a cultural advisor and linguist and is willing to do so in \nthe future. Numerous linguists, translators and advisors supporting U.S. forces, have \nfamily living in Afghanistan. Thousands of the U.S. and coalition armed forces and civilian \ncontractors serving in Afghanistan are targets of terrorists along with Afghan civilians who \nsupport the Afghan Government and cooperate with coalition forces.  \n \nThe mere possession of a close personal relationship with a person who is a citizen \nand resident of a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline \nB. However, depending on the facts and circumstances, this factor alone is sufficient to \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncreate the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, the government ignores the rule of law including widely accepted civil \nliberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the \ngovernment is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a substantial amount of \ndeath or property damage, or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection \noperations against the United States. The relationship of Afghanistan with the United \nStates, and the situation in Afghanistan place a significant, but not insurmountable burden \nof persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships with his family members \nliving in Afghanistan do not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a \nposition where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a \ndesire to assist a relative living in Afghanistan.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives or terrorists from \nAfghanistan seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Afghanistan has an enormous \nproblem with terrorism. Applicant\u2019s relationships with relatives living in Afghanistan create \na potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on his family living \nthere in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. These \nrelationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7(a). Substantial evidence was produced of Applicant\u2019s contacts \nwith family in Afghanistan and has raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply.  \n \nApplicant was a major in the Afghan military from 1974 to approximately December \n1997. I do not find any disqualifying conditions are raised by his service and find in his \nfavor concerning this allegation. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter, son-in-law, siblings and their spouses are citizens and \nresidents of Afghanistan. He has infrequent contact with his siblings and their spouses, \nbut not casual. It is unknown how much contact he has with his son-in-law. He has \nfrequent and more than casual contact with his daughter. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has served and supported \nU.S. forces from 2005 to the present, serving both in the United States and in Afghanistan. \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen, bought a home, and has considerable financial interests \nin the United States. Seven of his eight children are citizens and residents of the United \nStates. He fled Afghanistan and came to the United States as a refugee.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s years of support to the United States military in Afghanistan as a \nlinguist, including the dangers that service entailed, weigh heavily towards mitigating \nsecurity concerns. Applicant is currently serving as a linguist in support of the U.S. armed \nforces. He continues to support the United States\u2019 goals in Afghanistan. He has \nexpressed his loyalty and commitment to the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand resident of Afghanistan. Like every other resident of Afghanistan, any of his relatives \nwho may be living in Afghanistan are at risk from terrorists. \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother works for the Afghan government. His son-in-law works for \nTurkish forces. I have considered these contacts. It is important to be mindful of the United \nStates\u2019 huge investment of manpower and money in Afghanistan, and Applicant has \nsupported U.S. goals and objectives there. Applicant and his relatives living in \nAfghanistan are potential targets of terrorists, and Applicant\u2019s potential access to \nclassified information could theoretically add risk to his relatives living in Afghanistan from \nlawless elements in Afghanistan.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s possible future connections to his relatives living in Afghanistan are \nless significant than his connections to the United States. His employment in support of \nthe U.S. Government, financial interests and bonds to the United States, performance as \na linguist to U.S. forces, seven children who are U.S. citizens and residents, and his own \nU.S. citizenship are important factors weighing towards mitigation of security concerns. \nHe has no assets in Afghanistan, and he has significant financial interests in the United \nStates. Based on Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationship and loyalty to the United \nStates, he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. \nHis connections to the United States taken together are sufficient to fully overcome and \nmitigate the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant serves as a linguist for a federal contractor and has actively supported \nthe U.S. military mission in Afghanistan for 14 years. He understands the risks associated \nwith having family in Afghanistan. Based on Applicant\u2019s past commitment and service and \nhis continued loyalty to the United States, he has mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

National security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn November 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective within the DOD after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 6, 2018 (Answer), and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on April 5, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice of \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nHearing on April 26, 2019, setting the hearing for May 31, 2019. Department Counsel \noffered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 into evidence. Applicant testified, and \noffered Exhibits (AE) A through H into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until June 7, 2019, to \npermit submission of additional evidence. Applicant timely filed an updated Exhibit List, \nattachments to AE D, and a footnote to AE H. Department Counsel had no objections and \nthose additional documents are admitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJune 10, 2019. On June 12, 2019, Applicant submitted four corrections to the transcript. \nDepartment Counsel filed no objections. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nWithdrawal of Paragraph 1 of the SOR \n \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel withdrew Paragraph 1 \nof the SOR, alleging security concerns under the personal conduct guideline. (Tr. 10) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, a written request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about Turkey. Applicant did not object, and I have \ntaken administrative notice of the facts contained in the request that are supported by \nsource documents from official U.S. Government publications. (Tr. 17) The facts \nadministratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and not subject to \nreasonable dispute. Those facts are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant was born in Turkey in 1970 and moved to Germany with her family in \n1976, when she was five years old. In 1988, she met a man in Germany, who was born \nin Turkey. They married in Turkey and were divorced in Turkey in 1991. During their \nmarriage, they lived in Germany. She has one child from that marriage, who was born in \nGermany in 1992. After filing a letter with the Turkish consulate, renouncing her Turkish \ncitizenship, Applicant applied for and received German citizenship in 1993. In 1996, she \nmet her second husband, a U.S. citizen, while he was stationed with the military in \nGermany. They married some months later during a trip to Denmark. They moved to the \nUnited States in 1996. She has one child from that marriage, who was born in the United \nStates. In 1997, she received permanent U.S. residency. In 2008, she became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. She and her second husband divorced in 2012. Applicant has \ndual citizenship with Germany. She attended U.S. community colleges, and has earned \nsome credits. Both of her children reside in the United States. (Tr. 26 GE 1, GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant has worked for federal contractors since 2006, providing various \nservices, sometimes overseas, including the Middle East. She has held security \nclearances some of that time, beginning in 2011. In January 2017, she applied for a \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nposition with a federal contractor that requires a security clearance. Since then, she has \nworked for federal contractors on short-term contracts. (Tr. 31-35, 91; GE 1) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s elderly mother is a citizen and resident of Turkey. Her father died in \n2012. Prior to moving back to Turkey, Applicant\u2019s mother resided in Germany with other \nfamily members. She worked in a factory in Germany, and is now retired. She receives a \nmonthly pension of about $1,000 from Germany. She also receives about $500 a month \nfrom a pension she earned in Turkey while working and living there. (Tr. 36-39, 73-75, \n79) Applicant does not provide her mother financial support; however, her mother sent \nApplicant\u2019s daughter about $7,000 or $8,000 to help with college expenses several years \nago. (Tr. 80) Applicant maintains contact with her mother. (Answer) \n \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s parents were married, they purchased properties, including \napartment buildings. (Tr. 40, 45) Upon Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s death in 2012, her mother \ninherited 40% of his estate. The remaining 60% was divided among Applicant, her sister, \nand four half-siblings. Applicant inherited two small apartments. She subsequently sold \none for $27,000, and transferred the proceeds of the sale into her U.S. bank account. Her \nmother has rented out the other apartment. Applicant does not receive any rental monies \nbecause they are used for repairs and maintenance. (Tr. 46-48) She thinks her mother\u2019s \nassets now total $700,000 to $800,000. (Tr. 86) She and her sister will inherit her mother\u2019s \nestate. (Tr. 80) Applicant owns two homes in the United States. She resides in one and \nrents the other. (Tr. 95) \n \n \nIn 2014, Applicant visited the Turkish Consulate in the United States, in order to \nobtain proof that she was related to her deceased father and entitled to receive an \ninheritance. Her married name had caused confusion with her Turkish documents. While \nat the consulate, she discussed her situation with a woman employee, who helped her \nresolve the problem. Before leaving the consulate, Applicant heard the woman employee \nspeak German. Applicant then began talking to the woman in German. After a few \nminutes, the woman gave Applicant her business card. Applicant subsequently \u201dfriended\u201d \nthe woman on Facebook, and sent a Facebook message thanking her for her help in \nresolving the name issue. Several weeks later, Applicant \u201cunfriended\u201d the woman \nbecause she was concerned that she should not converse with a Turkish official. \nApplicant has not had contact with the woman since July 2014. (Tr. 48-55, 83-85; GE 2; \nAE A (1) and (2))   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger sister is a citizen of Germany and resident of Turkey. Her \nsister takes care of their mother, and lives in one of their mother\u2019s apartments. She is \ndivorced and has children. (Tr.42- 44) Applicant\u2019s sister receives financial support from \nher mother and her father\u2019s estate. (Tr. 80-82) Applicant maintains contact with her sister. \n(Tr. 83; Answer) \n \n \nApplicant has two half-brothers through her father, who was married to another \nwoman before he married Applicant\u2019s mother. They are citizens and residents of Turkey. \nApplicant had infrequent contact with those half-brothers before her father died. She has \nhad no contact with them since his death. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant had contact with one of \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nher half-sisters, who is a citizen and resident of Turkey, while they were teens. Applicant \nhas not had contact with her since her father\u2019s death in 2012. Her other half-sister is \ndeceased. (Tr. 43-45) \n \n \nDuring an investigative interview in March 2011, Applicant said that she has visited \nTurkey almost yearly since 2010: once in 2010; once in 2011; twice in 2012; once in 2013; \nonce in 2015; and once in 2016. She noted that she traveled there for tourism or pleasure. \n(GE 2)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation. An active reservist, whom \nApplicant has known since 2011, stated that he and Applicant are good friends. He \nbelieves she is an honest and trustworthy person. (AE B.2) A retired Army sergeant, who \nknows Applicant as a friend and colleague, supports her request for a security clearance. \nThey worked together in the Middle East. He said she is hardworking and reliable. (AE \nB.3) \n \nTurkey \n \n \nTurkey is a constitutional republic with a multiparty parliamentary system. The \npresident\u2019s powers are not precisely defined and his influence depends on his personality \nand political weight. Its citizens and foreigners have been targeted by domestic and \ntransnational terrorist groups for many years. There have been terrorist bombings in the \npast five years resulting in deaths. The targets have been religious, government, political, \ntourist, and business locations throughout the country. In addition, leftist and Islamic \nterrorist groups have targeted U.S. and Western interests. The potential for future terrorist \nattacks remains high. Its judiciary is declared to be independent, but is in need of reform. \nThere are significant human rights abuses with respect to detainees and personal \nfreedoms. The U.S. State Department warns citizens to reconsider travel to Turkey due \nto the presence of terrorism. (HE 1) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contact with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nAlthough Turkey is a constitutional republic with a multiparty parliamentary system, \nit engages in human rights violations and there is a risk of injury to citizens and visitors \ndue to the activities of terrorists. U.S. citizens are warned about traveling to Turkey. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Turkey. Her sister is a citizen of Germany \nand resident of Turkey. These facts place a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant \nto demonstrate that her ongoing connections and relationships with family members, who \nare residents or citizens of Turkey, do not create a heightened risk of foreign influence or \npose a security risk. The evidence is sufficient to raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(b).  \n \n  \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns based on the facts of this case: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nThere is no evidence that intelligence, operatives, criminals, or terrorists from or in \nTurkey seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant \nor her family residing in Turkey since she has been working for federal contractors. \nNevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the future. International \nterrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as effectively as capable state \nintelligence services, and Turkey has a problem with terrorism and human rights abuses. \nApplicant\u2019s family in Turkey \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes to the \nattention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would attempt to \nexert coercion upon [her].\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing \nISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)). The evidence establishes limited \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a). \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States.\u201d Applicant has established strong U.S. \nconnections. She married a U.S. citizen in 1996 and has lived here since then. She \nreceived permanent U.S. residency in 1997 and became a U.S. citizen in 2008. She has \nattended community colleges in the United States. Since 2006, she has worked for federal \ncontractors, sometime overseas. She has established good friends here, one of whom is \na soldier and worked with her in the Middle East. She renounced her Turkish citizenship \nin 1996. One of her children is a citizen of the United States and both of her children are \nresidents of the United States. Her financial accounts are in the United States. She owns \ntwo homes in the United States. Based on these connections to the United States, there \nis a strong indication that Applicant could be expected to resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interests. Strong mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b) was established. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not fully apply to the security concerns raised regarding Applicant\u2019s \nmother, who is a citizen and resident of Turkey, or her sister, who is a citizen of Germany \nand resident of Turkey. Applicant has ongoing communication with both of them, and \nmakes periodic visits to see them. This mitigating condition fully applies to Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with her two half-brothers, one half-sister, and an employee of the Turkish \nConsulate in the United States. Applicant has not been in contact with her half-siblings \nsince the death of her father in 2012 or the Turkish employee since 2014. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant met her burden to \nmitigate the foreign influence security concerns raised by the facts of this case. Her \nfamilial circumstances create no significant potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, \nor duress. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n  Paragraph 1, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n  Paragraph 2, Guideline B: \n \n \n           FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:   \n           For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Eligibility for security clearance access is granted.   \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 4, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the \naffirmative findings required to continue his security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant \na Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 29, 2018, detailing security concerns under \npsychological conditions (Guideline I). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) which became effective on June 8, 2017.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on September 18, 2018. He provided a \nsupplemental answer on October 3, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 4, 2019, for a hearing on March 4, 2019. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s exhibits (GE) 1, 2, and 5 were \nentered into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s objections to GE 3 and GE 4 will be \ndiscussed below in Rulings on Evidence. Applicant\u2019s three exhibits (AE) A-C were entered \ninto evidence without objection. The record in this case closed when DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on March 13, 2019.  \n \nRulings on Evidence \n \nApplicant objected to the medical opinions contained in GE 3 and GE 4. \nSpecifically, he argued that the medical opinions within both exhibits, which are hearsay, \ndeny him the right of confrontation and cross-examination as set forth in E3.1.22 of \nDirective 5220.6. Department Counsel responded that: (1) the medical records are \nadmissible as an exception to the hearsay rule; (2) in the case of medical records, the \nGovernment is not required to have the author available for cross-examination; and (3) \nmedical records, like police reports, are generally admissible in DOHA hearings.  \n \nI overruled Applicant\u2019s objection and admitted GE 3 and 4 into evidence. In \nadministrative hearings, including security clearance adjudications, hearsay evidence is \nadmissible and may constitute substantial evidence. See, ISCR Case No. 03-06770 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2004). E3.1.22 should be interpreted in the context of the other related \nparagraphs of the Directive rather in a manner that renders the other paragraphs \nmeaningless. In DOHA hearings, the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) apply as a guide \nto promote the development of a full record. See, E3.1.19. Using FRE 803(6) as a guide, \nI conclude that both exhibits and opinions therein are admissible. There has been no \nshowing that \u201cthe source of the information or the method of preparation indicate a lack \nof trustworthiness.\u201d The presence of hearsay in both exhibits does not prohibit their \nadmission, but may affect their weight. (Tr. 13-16) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nSOR 1.a alleges that Applicant was hospitalized from October to November 2014 \non an emergency basis for depression and suicidal thoughts. He was diagnosed with \nBipolar Disorder. Applicant admitted this allegation. SOR 1.b alleges that Applicant was \ndiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II in May 2018 in an evaluation conducted by the \nDepartment of Defense. Though the evaluator determined that the condition was in full \nremission, the evaluator opined that Applicant\u2019s lack of candor during the evaluation led \nhim to conclude that Applicant would not likely seek treatment if his symptoms recurred. \nIn his September 2018 answer, he denied this allegation. In his October 2018 answer, he \nindicated that he could neither admit nor deny the allegation because the Government \npsychologist did not disclose the diagnosis to him. The second reason is that Applicant \ndenies that he was not candid during the examination and that he would not seek \n\n \n3 \n \ntreatment if his symptoms recurred. (GE 1; GE 3 at 25; GE 4; September 2018 response \nto SOR) \n \n \nApplicant is 70 years old. He has been married for 46 years and has five adult-\naged children. From 1969 until his honorable discharge in 1975, Applicant served in the \nU.S. Army on active duty and in the Reserve. In 1974, Applicant received an Associate\u2019s \nof Arts degree. In 1976, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical \nengineering. He received a professional engineer\u2019s license in 1983. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since 1969. Applicant has been employed as an integration engineer \nfor a defense contractor since 2004. From October 2014 through February 2015 (when \nhe submitted his most recent e-QIP), Applicant was on medical leave. (GE 2 at 7-28; AE \nA; AE C at 5; Tr. 23-27, 28-34) \n \n \nIn 1983, Applicant began working for a pharmaceutical company as a project \nengineer. In 1984 or 1985, he started to become depressed and suicidal. This was the \nfirst time he could remember having depressive symptoms. He sought treatment during \nhis employment at the company, though in 1984, he declined advice to seek treatment. \nIn 1993, he terminated his employment with the company rather than comply with advice \nto seek treatment. Applicant started working on his relative\u2019s farm because his family was \nworth more to him than his job at the company. He worked there until 2004. Then, \nApplicant began working as an integration engineer for the predecessor of his current \nemployer. He is still working for the same company at the same location at the present \ntime. (GE 3 at 80; Tr. 35-40, 54-58) See also, AE C, attachment.   \n \nApplicant voluntarily entered inpatient treatment (for the first time) in October 2014 \nat the hospital identified in SOR 1.a. During his hospitalization for suicidal thoughts and \ndepression over the next three weeks, he met with a psychologist regularly and was \nprescribed medication. Though he could not remember informing the medical staff that \nhe had two contradictory personalities or that he was a prophet, he did recall telling them \nhe had the power to move storms, but had not moved any in over three years. At his \ndischarge, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After his discharge in November 2014, \nhe received outpatient treatment, including medication. He has had no subsequent \ntreatment or medication since July 2015. He has not had a relapse of his condition since \nhis November 2014 discharge. (GE 3 at 80; Tr. 40-43, 48, 65-69, 70) \n \nOther than the inpatient treatment in October 2014, Applicant recalled seeking \noutpatient psychological and psychiatric counseling, electroconvulsive therapy, and \npsychotropic medication periodically over the years since 1985. The consults and \nmedications would work temporarily. When the treatment worked, he enjoyed life and was \nnot depressed. When the treatment stopped working, Applicant\u2019s symptoms returned and \nhe discontinued treatment. Sometimes the side effects of the prescribed medication were \nworse than the mental condition itself. (Tr. 51-52, 59-61) See also, AE C, attachment. \n \n \nA Government psychologist (Dr. D) was asked by the DOD CAF to evaluate \nApplicant for the purpose of determining whether Applicant\u2019s reliability or judgment posed \n\n \n4 \n \na threat to his proper handling of classified information grounded on the belief that he may \nhave a condition or diagnosis which, if left untreated, may disqualify him from security \nclearance eligibility. In May 2018, Dr. D conducted an online evaluation at Applicant\u2019s \nhome. The evaluation included a clinical interview. The online evaluation, which was \nconducted using Applicant\u2019s computer and his cell phone, made Applicant uncomfortable \nbecause he did not believe he could trust the Government psychologist. In addition, he \ndid not want to experience the emotional pain associated with talking about his past \npsychological history, and even though the government psychologist explained to him \nthat not talking about the history could have an adverse impact on his security clearance \napplication. (Tr. 43-47) \n \n \nDr. D prepared and submitted a \u201cDOD CAF EVALUATION\u201d in May 2018. The \nsources for Dr. D\u2019s ultimate opinions were an online administered clinical interview of \nApplicant, a review of his medical records and a personal assessment inventory (PAI). \nThe evaluation included an interview with Applicant\u2019s wife who informed Dr. D that \nApplicant was much better currently and had worked through his issues. Dr. D noted that \nApplicant was unwilling to discuss triggers and causes of his depression. He denied \ndiscussing the dynamics of his historically depressive events and would reply to the \ndoctor\u2019s questions into his psychological history with statements instead of answers to \nthe questions. One such statement was citing his core issues without explaining what \nthose core issues were. Another statement he used to field several of Dr. D\u2019s questions \nwas replying that he did not remember his psychological history. During Applicant\u2019s \ndiscussion of his treatment history to Dr. D, Applicant indicated he had seen many \npsychiatrists and psychologists over a 30-year period, but was not currently in treatment. \nDr. D did not indicate how long Applicant had not been participating in treatment. (GE 4 \nat 1-3)  \n \n \nIn the mental status examination of his May 2018 evaluation, Dr. D did not \nobserve any signs of agitation. There was no consistent evidence of a loosening of \nassociations and his long-term memory was not considered intact. Applicant denied \npsychotic symptoms and visual hallucinations. Dr. D observed no evidence of \u201cparanoia \nor ideas of reference, although direct questions about this topic were deflected.\u201d There \nwas no evidence of mania. The PAI results disclosed that there was no psychopathology \nthat would be considered serious or damaging. The clinical interview and PAI indicated a \nlack of current psychological symptoms that would disqualify him from possessing a \nsecurity clearance. Dr. D\u2019s diagnosis, based on Applicant\u2019s previous psychiatric history of \nBipolar Disorder diagnosed during the SOR 1.a hospitalization, was Hx (based on \nprevious history): Bipolar Disorder, in full remission. (GE 4 at 3-4) \n \n \nIn the prognosis section of his evaluation, Dr. D opined that Applicant\u2019s refusal \nto provide a forthright discussion into his mental health history showed a lack of judgment, \nparticularly because the potential negative impact on Applicant\u2019s employment would \nusually persuade an uncooperative applicant to reveal the requested information. If, \naccording to Dr. D, Applicant has a mental condition, then it likely will never be treated. \n\n \n5 \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s resistance to treatment, Dr. D was unable to recommend Applicant \nfor a security clearance. (GE 4 at 3-4; AE C, attachment) \n \n \nIn December 2018, Applicant was evaluated by a psychiatrist (Dr. E) at the \nrequest of Applicant\u2019s attorney. (The qualifications of Dr. E to testify in forensic psychiatry \nwere stipulated by the parties.) Applicant was very cooperative with Dr. E because the \nface-to-face contact nurtured Applicant\u2019s trust in the doctor. (Tr. 48-49, 77-78) \n \nDr. E prepared and submitted an evaluation of Applicant in December 2018. The \nbasis for his opinion were DOD records, inpatient medical records from the SOR 1.a \nhospitalization, Dr. D\u2019s evaluation, and Applicant\u2019s seven-page statement chronicling his \npsychiatric treatment. Dr. E conducted a four-hour face-to face clinical interview with \nApplicant. He administered a PAI that was interpreted by a Ph.D (field not identified). Dr. \nE also interviewed Applicant\u2019s wife for 30 minutes, and reviewed the SOR. (AE C at 1, \nand attachment; Tr. 80-82) \n \nAccording to Dr. E\u2019s evaluation, Applicant suffered from depression from the \nmiddle 1980s through 2015. Applicant\u2019s depression was characterized by loss of energy, \nloss of interest in activities, and difficulty with focus. Before Applicant\u2019s hospitalization in \nOctober 2014 (SOR 1.a), he had electroconvulsive surgery. Since 2015, he has had no \nclinically significant depression. Applicant never had a problem with alcohol although he \ndrank more when he was in a depressed mood. Applicant\u2019s wife informed Dr. E that \nApplicant has been psychologically stable since 2015, with no serious depression or \nmania. Applicant\u2019s mental status exam revealed coherent speech with no abnormalities \nin speech. His affective responses disclosed \u201cno current evidence of depression, anxiety, \nhypomania, mania or inappropriate affect.\u201d Applicant indicated that he feels sad \nsometimes, but has not had severe depression in more than three years. Dr. E observed \nno attention or concentration problems and Applicant denied sleep and eating problems. \nOverall, Dr. E found intact Applicant\u2019s cognitive functioning with no mood problems or \npsychosis. Drs. D and E found no evidence of psychopathology in their review of the PAI \nresults. (AE C at 2-8) \n \nFollowing his complete examination of all the information presented concerning \nApplicant, Dr. E found that Applicant was cooperative in discussing all areas of his \npsychiatric history. His decision to refuse medical treatment was not caused by a \n\u201c\u2018resistance to treatment\u2019\u201d as expressed by Dr. D, but a lack of continuous improvement, \nor reaching the conclusion that the treatment did not work. Dr. E\u2019s diagnosis of Applicant \nwas recurrent major depression in full remission. Dr. E believed that based on Applicant\u2019s \nclinical interview and his wife\u2019s observations, his condition had been in remission for at \nleast three years. Unlike Dr. D, Dr. E did not believe Applicant had a condition or diagnosis \nthat would impact his reliability or judgment in a manner that could present a threat for \nmishandling classified information. Dr. E indicated \u201cI found nothing to suggest that \n[Applicant\u2019s] current condition would impair his ability to be reliable, trustworthy, of good \nconduct and character, honest, with integrity and loyal to the United States.\u201d Dr. E \ndetermined that Applicant would comply with security regulations. Dr. E believes that \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s condition is treatable. Because of the statistical likelihood of a recurrence of \na major depressive episode in the future, Dr. E recommended a psychiatrist monitor \nApplicant regularly. (AE C at 9-10; Tr. 85, 92-97) \n \nAt the hearing, Dr. E was asked to comment on statements made by Applicant \nduring his hospitalization in October 2014. (SOR 1.a) Those statements included hitting \nhimself in the head with a hammer, stating he was a prophet, and having the power to \nmove storms. Dr. E explained those events were psychotic symptoms, which are \ndelusional or false beliefs, and occur with individuals who have a bipolar disorder in a \nmanic state. When those delusions or false beliefs go into remission, the false beliefs \ndisappear. If Applicant had reported those delusions or false beliefs, Dr. E may have \nchanged his diagnosis to schizoaffective personality disorder, depending on the \npersistence of the delusion or false belief. If the belief was transient and not fixed, then \nDr. E would consider a schizotypal disorder where the individual is not psychotic, but they \nhave an odd belief that is not a delusion. In Dr. E\u2019s opinion, a power to move storms in \nthe context of a normal mood that was not revealed in the medical records or Applicant\u2019s \nmental examination, could support a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder. (Tr. \n85-89) \n \nDr. E considered the October 2014 (SOR 1.a) bipolar diagnosis was actually an \nepisode of agitated depression that was more consistent with a 30-year history of \ndepressive symptoms. Even though a schizotypal personality disorder may be more \ndifficult to treat, a peculiar belief (in the context of a normal mood) may not need \ntreatment. Dr. E believes that Applicant\u2019s wife will ensure that Applicant pursues treatment \nin the future as he has done in the past. (Tr. 100-108) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. \nAG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nPsychological Conditions \n \n \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set forth in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder \nis not required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly \nqualified mental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or \npsychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. \nGovernment, should be consulted when evaluating potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating information under this guideline and an \nopinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of mental health counseling. \n \n \n \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28 are: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, \nincluding, but not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, \nparanoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, \nor bizarre behaviors; \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair  judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization;  \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, \nfailure to take prescribed medication or failure to attend required \ncounseling sessions. \n \n \nThe Government has presented sufficient evidence under AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b) \nand 28(c). Dr. D (Government psychiatrist) diagnosed Applicant with Hx (based on \nprevious history): Bipolar Disorder II, in full remission. Applicant admitted and Dr. E \nreported that Applicant received treatment dating to the middle 1980s for depression. \nApplicant was voluntarily hospitalized from October to November 2014 for bipolar \n\n \n8 \n \ndisorder. AG \u00b6 28(d) does not apply because there is insufficient evidence of a failure to \nfollow a prescribed treatment plan. Applicant stopped treatment in July 2015 because he \ndid not believe the treatment and medications were improving his mental condition. Dr. D \nnoted that Applicant was not in treatment when he evaluated him. \n \n The potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nThe record provides ample evidence that Applicant received outpatient \ntreatment from numerous psychiatrists and psychologists over a 30-year period. \nWhen the treatment worked, Applicant\u2019s life improved. When the treatment did not \nwork, Applicant\u2019s depression would return and he discontinued treatment, particularly \nwith the unpleasant side effects of some of the prescribed medication. Dr. E indicated \nthat Applicant\u2019s condition is treatable and he would seek treatment should he have a \nflorid episode in the future. Applicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6 29(a). \n \n \nBoth Dr. D (Government psychologist) and Dr. E believed that there were no \npsychological symptoms that would affect Applicant\u2019s ability to hold a security \nclearance. However, Dr. D interpreted Applicant\u2019s refusal to discuss his psychiatric \nhistory and response to treatment as a lack in judgment and supporting Dr. D\u2019s \ndecision not to recommend Applicant for a security clearance.  \n \n \nI believe that Applicant was not comfortable providing a psychological \nevaluation to Dr. D using a computer and a cell phone, and did not trust Dr. D as a \nresult. Talking to Dr. D about his psychological history and the numerous consults \nwith psychiatrists and psychologists distressed Applicant.  \n \n \nDr. E found Applicant to be open and willing to discuss all items in his \npsychiatric history. In Dr. E\u2019s opinion, for the past three years, Applicant\u2019s mental \ncondition has been in full remission. Although there was a statistical chance for \nrecurrence of a major depressive episode in the future, regular monitoring by a \n\n \n9 \n \nmedical health professional was recommended. Applicant\u2019s condition is treatable and \nhe will obtain treatment should he need it. AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(c) and 29(e) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access \nto classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 70-year-old mature adult, who has been married for 46 years and \nhas five adult-aged children. He served honorably in the U.S. Army. He has worked as \nan integration engineer for his employer since about 2004.  \n \n \nApplicant has suffered from depression since the middle 1980s. In the next 30 \nyears, he sought outpatient treatment from many psychiatrists and psychologists. During \nan episode in October 2014, he voluntarily entered inpatient hospitalization to try another \ntype of treatment for the first time. Following his discharge in November 2014, Applicant \nparticipated in outpatient aftercare until July 2015, when the treatment stopped working \nas it had many times in past. \n \n \nIn May 2018, Dr. D diagnosed Applicant with a mental condition (by mental history) \nin full remission. In December 2018, Dr. E diagnosed Applicant with a different mental \ncondition in full remission based on a 30-year history of depressive episodes. Based on \nApplicant\u2019s candor that he demonstrated to Dr. E for his evaluative report and his credible \ntestimony that he will seek treatment should his symptoms recur, I conclude that Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns arising from the guideline for psychological \nconditions.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n10 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis granted.  \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The amended SOR alleges that Applicant has nine delinquent debts totaling approximately $56,000 including delinquent child support (\u00b6 1.a); two vehicle repossessions (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c); four charged-off accounts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.g), and two accounts in collection (\u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i).

He also addressed most of his delinquent debts after he \nreceived the statement of reasons. His recent efforts are insufficient to establish a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. He failed to demonstrate good judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to comply with the law. The financial considerations security concerns are \nnot mitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 15, 2016, \nseeking clearance eligibility required for his position with a federal contractor. After \nreviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 17, 2018, \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on January 22, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on March 4, 2019, and issued a notice of hearing \non April 4, 2019, setting the hearing for May 1, 2019. At the hearing, the Government \noffered five exhibits (GE 2 through 6). GE 1 is the discovery letter that was marked for \n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe record, but it is not evidence. Applicant testified and submitted eight exhibits (AE 1 \nthrough 8). AE 6, 7, and 8 were received post-hearing. All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 13, 2019. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nAt the hearing, I amended SOR \u00b6 1.j to read: \u201cYou failed to timely file, as \nrequired, Federal income tax returns for tax years 2012, 2015, 2017, and 2018.\u201d The \namendment was made to conform the SOR allegations to the evidence presented. No \nobjections were raised, and Applicant admitted that he had not failed his 2018 income \ntax return. (Tr. 56-58) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe amended SOR alleges that Applicant has nine delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $56,000 including delinquent child support (\u00b6 1.a); two vehicle \nrepossessions (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c); four charged-off accounts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.g), and two \naccounts in collection (\u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i). It also alleges Applicant failed to timely file \nfederal tax returns for tax years 2012, 2015, 2017, and 2018 (\u00b6 1.j). \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j. He partially admitted SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, and admitted all of the remaining allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.f, and 1.i). His SOR \nadmissions, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 1993, and shortly thereafter enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He served \nhonorably on active duty until he was medically retired in 2007. He possessed a secret \nclearance during his service.  \n \nApplicant married in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He married his wife in 2001. He \nhas a step-child age 22, and three children, ages 24, 19 and 18. Applicant has been \nattending college since 2007, and anticipates earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in December \n2019.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history indicates that after his discharge from the service he was \nunemployed for about three months. He then worked full-time for different employers \nbetween February 2008 and August 2015. He was unemployed between August 2015 \nand February 2016. He was hired by the federal contractor currently sponsoring his \nclearance in February 2016. (GE 2) \n \nIn his response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2016 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed that he had financial problems. Specifically, he stated that after losing his job \nin 2009 he became delinquent on his child support obligation. He disclosed no \nadditional financial problems. Although not alleged, Applicant responded \u201cNO\u201d to \nquestions asking whether he had any delinquent, in-collection, or charged-off accounts. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHe failed to disclose the charged off, in collection, or delinquent accounts alleged in the \nSOR. He also failed to disclose that he did not timely file his federal income tax return \nfor tax years 2012 and 2015.  \n \nApplicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2012 in March 2014. He \nwas issued a $2,563 refund. He timely filed his federal income tax returns for tax years \n2013 and 2014. He was issued refunds for both tax years of $1,592 and $2,229, \nrespectively. Applicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2015 in January \n2017. He filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2016 in May 2017. The IRS \nconsidered his 2017 filing timely. Applicant filed his federal income tax return for tax \nyear 2017 in July 2019. As of May 2019, Applicant had not filed his 2018 federal income \ntax return and he did not ask for an extension of time to file. (GE 3) \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.a (delinquent child support), Applicant\u2019s documentary \nevidence shows that he has been timely paying his child support obligation since \nDecember 2015. The original delinquent obligation was for $32,968. Applicant has paid \n$29,243 as of May 2019. Notwithstanding the payments made, Applicant intends to \ndispute the child support payments made and request reimbursement, because his \nson\u2019s mother had released him from his child support obligation for a period, and there \nwere several periods during which the child was staying with him either because the \nmother was deployed or incarcerated.  \n \nApplicant intends to dispute the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c (two \nvehicle repossessions). He explained that he refinanced two vehicles through the same \ncredit union. One of the vehicles\u2019 engine seized while he was in the process of disputing \nthe purchase with the seller and stopped paying the car note because the car was not \nworking. The credit union repossessed both cars for lack of payments on the loan. \nApplicant believes the repossession of the second vehicle was unfair and that it was \nsold in auction for less than its fair value. Notwithstanding, he presented no evidence to \nshow he has filed electronic or written disputes against the seller, financial institution, or \nthe credit bureaus concerning the above accounts. Applicant stated that he is disputing \nthe accounts, but understands that likely he will have to pay them. \n \nApplicant settled the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f for less than what \nhe owes on May 20, 2019. (AE 6) For SOR \u00b6 1.d, he promised to make $200 monthly \npayments in June, July, and August 2019. For SOR \u00b6 1.f, he promised to make $100 \nmonthly payments in June, July, and August 2019. The record closed before any of the \npayments were made, so there is no documentary evidence in the record to confirm any \npayments were made. \n \nApplicant settled the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e on May 14, 2019. He \nauthorized the creditor to charge $92 against his credit card for four consecutive months \nstarting June 2019. The record closed before any of the payments were made, so there \nis no documentary evidence in the record to confirm the payments. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant was not aware of the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g and he denied it. \nHe testified that he contacted the creditor and the creditor does not know what the \naccount was for, and does not have any information connecting Applicant to the \naccount. (Tr. 42) Applicant initially denied the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, but paid it \nin May 2019. (AE 6) He testified that he paid the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. He \nbelieves that it was related to his son\u2019s cancer treatment when he was five years old. He \npresented no documentary evidence of this payment. \n \nApplicant presented little documentary evidence to show that he had contact with \nhis creditors, made payments, established payment arrangements, disputed accounts, \nor otherwise resolved any of the accounts alleged before the SOR was issued. He \npresented no evidence to show he has participated in financial counseling or that he \nhas a working budget. \n \nConcerning his delinquent taxes, Applicant did not explain why he did not timely \nfile his 2012 and 2015 income tax returns. He did not file his 2017 and 2018 income tax \nreturns because he intends to dispute his child support arrearages as soon as his son is \nemancipated. He was anticipating receiving refunds, and because of a garnishment filed \nagainst him, the refunds would have been given to the mother of his son for past-due \nchild support. He believes that he is entitled to credit for the periods his son was living \nwith him, for child support he paid, and for a period the mother waived the child support \npayments. He believes that if he had filed the tax returns and the mother was given the \nrefunds, he would not be able to recover the money from her.  \n \nApplicant explained that his financial problems resulted from periods of \nunemployment and underemployment, and having to pay child support. Applicant \nexpressed remorse for not filing his income tax returns on time. He claimed that he has \nlearned a hard lesson and promised to timely file his income tax returns and to pay his \ntaxes in the future.  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant highlighted that he has worked for the federal \ngovernment for the last 25 years, basically doing the same job that he did while in the \nservice. He believes his past behavior has proven that he is not a security risk. \nApplicant noted that his wife is about to graduate and he anticipates she will start \nworking and contributing to the household finances in the near future. He believes that \nwith their combined income, he will be able to pay his financial obligations and living \nexpenses. He believes that he is doing the best he can do in his current circumstances. \nHe is concerned about not getting his clearance and losing his job.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. He had \neight accounts delinquent, in collection, or charged off. He failed to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2012, 2015, 2017, and 2018. AG \u00b6 19 provides \ndisqualifying conditions that raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this \ncase: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d \nand \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The \nrecord established the disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nSix mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013), the Appeal Board \nconcisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that none of the mitigating conditions \nare sufficiently raised by the evidence to mitigate the financial considerations concerns. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are frequent, recent, \nand ongoing. Additionally, he failed to timely file his 2012, 2015, 2017, and 2018 income \ntax returns.  \n \n \nApplicant established circumstances beyond his control that may have \ncontributed to or aggravated his financial situation, such as his medical retirement from \nthe \nservice \nin \n2007 \nand \nperiods \nof \nunemployment \nor \nunderemployment. \nNotwithstanding, I find that Applicant failed to establish that he was financially \nresponsible under the circumstances. He presented little evidence of reasonable efforts \nto pay, settle, dispute, or otherwise resolve his delinquent accounts until after he was \nserved with the SOR in December 2018.  \n \n \nI give Applicant credit for filing his past-due income tax returns, except for tax \nyear 2018. I also give Applicant credit for addressing his delinquent accounts after \nreceipt of the SOR. He was able to pay, settle, and establish payment arrangements \nwith most of his creditors. I further note Applicant\u2019s good track record paying his past-\ndue child support. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence is insufficient to \nshow that he was financially responsible. Applicant presented little evidence of any \npayments made, payment arrangements established, disputes filed, or resolution of any \nof the accounts alleged until after receipt of the SOR. Furthermore, although he settled \nfour SOR accounts, there is no documentary evidence to show he has made the agreed \npayments and that the accounts have been resolved. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare not under control. He failed to establish a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nto establish a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the two accounts he intends \nto dispute. Additionally, Applicant neglected his legal obligation to timely file his income \ntax returns for four years. \u201cFailure to comply with federal and state tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding to well-established Government rules and \nregulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for protecting \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). This is \ntrue even if the returns have been filed. See, ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 27, 2016).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his federal income tax returns in a timely manner, and \nhis failure to pay his debts does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information. See, ISCR Case \nNo. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). Applicant failed to demonstrate financial \nresponsibility. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 45, has about 25 years of active service in the Navy and working for \nfederal contractors. He held a clearance while in the service. Notwithstanding, he failed \nto demonstrate good judgment and reliability. His failure to timely file his tax returns and \nto pay his debts shows that he has a problem complying with well-established rules. At \nthis time, his evidence is insufficient to establish a track record of financial responsibility. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d-1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n   \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on November 27, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 7, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing (NOH) on March 25, 2019, scheduling the hearing for April 25, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, and submitted Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through S, which I admitted in evidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, \nI kept the record open until June 6, 2019, for additional evidence. By that date, \nApplicant submitted additional documentation, which I marked collectively as AE T and \nadmitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nMay 6, 2019.  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations but SOR \u00b6 1.c, which she denied. She is \n32 years old. She is single and she has one child, a minor. (Tr. at 48, 72, 115; GE 1). \n \n \nApplicant obtained her high school equivalency certificate in 2004 and attended \nsome college since 2010, but has not yet earned a degree. She has worked for her \ncurrent employer, a DOD contractor, since April 2017. She was a program manager as \nof the date of the hearing. She has never held a security clearance. (Tr. at 6, 20-21, 71-\n75, 98; GE 1, 7). \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges three judgments totaling $18,959 entered against Applicant in \n2008, 2015, and 2016 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c); a $415 delinquent student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.h); \nand seven delinquent consumer accounts totaling $14,248 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.g, 1.i - 1.k). \nThe debts are established by court records and credit reports from 2017 and 2018. \nApplicant also disclosed and discussed her debts in her 2017 security clearance \napplication (SCA) and during her 2018 background interviews. (GE 1-7). \n \n \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to earning a minimal income with \nvarious employers from approximately 2007 to December 2015. From 2007 to 2010, \nshe worked for a county health department at $15 hourly in an exempt, non-full-time \nposition, and she was required to \u201cwork up to a certain amount of cap hours for that \nyear,\u201d take a month of unemployment, then be rehired. In 2009, she became a single \nparent. Her child\u2019s father earns minimum wage as a construction worker and owes \napproximately $25,000 in delinquent child support for 2010 to 2016. He only began \ncontributing $240 monthly towards their child\u2019s tutoring expenses in 2016. (Tr. at 71-\n125; GE 1, 7). \n \n \nIn August 2014, Applicant was laid off by her employer due to a reorganization. \nShe was unemployed until May 2015, when she obtained part-time employment at $18 \nhourly for 20 hours per week. She relied on her employer\u2019s representation that her \nposition was slated to become a full-time one. In around September 2015, she was \nnotified by a county housing program, which had an income cap of $35,000 to $40,000 \nannually, that an apartment for which she had been waitlisted for six years was \navailable for her and her child. She then moved with her child out of her parents\u2019 home \nand into her own apartment. Her expenses increased from a monthly contribution of \n$400 to $800 monthly in rent plus other household expenses. When she obtained full-\ntime employment in December 2015, her income increased to $40,000 annually. As \nrequired, she notified the county housing authority and her monthly rent was increased \n\n \n3 \n \nto $1,200 monthly. Though she was prepared for her rent increase, she was unprepared \nfor the amount in which it did. She also cited to out-of-pocket medical expenses for her \nand her child, and the compromise of her bank account in July 2018, as additional \nfactors that contributed to her financial delinquencies. (Tr. at 71-125, 135; GE 1, 7). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c consist of three judgments entered against Applicant in \n2008 for $1,158; 2015 for $15,449; and 2016 for $2,352. The 2008 judgment for $1,158 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) was for a credit card Applicant obtained in approximately 2014, with a $500 \ncredit limit. She paid $2,348 to resolve this debt in April 2019, and the judgment was \nresolved as of October 2019. (Tr. at 83-87, 93, 99-103, 113, 128-130, 146-148; AE P, \nT). \n \n \nThe 2015 judgment for $15,449 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was for a $29,000 car loan \nApplicant obtained in approximately 2011 for a used car. She testified that she became \ndelinquent when she missed four monthly payments after her 2014 layoff, and when her \nmonthly rent increased in late 2015. She testified that she unsuccessfully attempted to \nreach a payment plan with the creditor in the summer of 2014, but the creditor \ndemanded payment in full of $20,000. Her car was repossessed in October 2014. She \ntestified that she reached a payment plan with the creditor\u2019s collection agency to repay \nhalf of the outstanding balance at $434 monthly for 36 months, after which time she \nwould enroll the remaining balance in her debt-consolidation plan. She made a $150 \npayment to the collection agency in November 2018. She testified that she was unable \nto try to resolve this judgment sooner because she prioritized other expenses. (Tr. at \n83-87, 93, 99-103, 108, 113, 125-128, 146-148; AE C, D, S, T). \n \n \nThe 2016 judgment for $2,352 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was for Applicant\u2019s delinquent rent for \nher apartment with the county housing program. She was already $1,600 delinquent \nwhen her rent was increased in late 2015. She ended her lease in November 2016 after \nshe unsuccessfully attempted to obtain rental assistance and could no longer afford her \nrent. She paid this judgment in September and October 2018. She testified that she was \nalso unable to pay it sooner because she prioritized other expenses. (Tr. at 83-87, 93, \n99-103, 118-125; AE A, B). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for an $11,028 charged-off auto loan that Applicant obtained in \nNovember 2014. After her credit was negatively affected by her car repossession, her \nonly available option for another means of transportation for her and her child was \nthrough a high-interest-rate loan. She testified that she enrolled this debt in her debt- \nconsolidation plan, and payment plan negotiations were underway. (Tr. at 103-107, 113, \n130-134; AE D, S, T).  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a credit card in collection for $818. Applicant testified that she \nobtained this credit card in an attempt to rebuild her credit, but it came with a high \ninterest rate and additional fees. The card became delinquent in June 2015. She \ntestified that she paid this debt from June 2015 until May 2018, when her bank account \nwas compromised, and she then forgot to provide the creditor with her updated bank \ninformation. She believed this debt was going to be imminently resolved with the funds \nshe paid into her debt-consolidation plan. (Tr. at 107, 113-114, 134-136; AE D, S, T). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a credit card past due for $120 with a total balance of $555. \nApplicant testified that she also obtained this credit card in an attempt to rebuild her \ncredit. She also believed it would be imminently resolved with the funds she paid into \nher debt-consolidation plan. (Tr. at 106-107, 113-114, 136-137; AE D, S, T). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is for a credit card past due for $111 with a total balance of $433. \nApplicant testified that she obtained this credit card in November 2015, also in an \nattempt to rebuild her credit. The card became delinquent in 2017. She settled this debt \nfor $228 and paid it in October 2018. As of November 2018, the creditor considered this \ndebt resolved. (Tr. at 107, 113, 137l; AE E, F). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is for a federal student loan placed for collection for $415. Applicant \nobtained a $1,000 student loan in around 2010 or 2012 for her college tuition. She could \nnot recall when it became delinquent. She made minimal payments of $5 monthly from \nJune 2015 to May 2016, and five payments of $204 from January through March 2018 \ntowards this student loan. She settled this loan for $380 and the creditor stated it was \nresolved as of April 2019. (Tr. at 72, 98-99, 107, 113, 137-139, 146-148; AE G, H, Q, T). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is for a prepaid credit card past due for $157 with a total balance of \n$395. Applicant testified that this credit card became delinquent in around 2017. In her \nAnswer, she stated that she established a five-month payment plan to resolve this debt. \nShe made three payments of $78 in October and November 2018. She made a final \npayment of $172 in April 2019 to resolve this debt. (Tr. at 107, 113, 139-141, 146-147; \nAE I, J, R, T). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k are for two cable accounts placed for collection for $732 and \n$287. Applicant testified that she had this cable service when she rented an apartment. \nShe returned the equipment in November 2017 and she testified that the fee in SOR \u00b6 \n1.j was waived as a result. She also testified that she paid the final bill in SOR \u00b6 1.k, \nand she provided documentation reflecting that she made a $186 payment in October \n2018. (Tr. at 108, 141-143; AE K, L). \n \n \nApplicant enrolled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f in her debt-consolidation plan \nin October 2018. She testified that she also included a $700 telephone debt and a $100 \nto $300 cash advance in her plan. Her plan provides that she pay $238 monthly \u201cfor the \npurposes of accumulating funds for settlements and the payment of our fees . . . .\u201d She \ntestified that she paid $16,000 into her plan as of the date of the hearing, and a \nrepresentative informed her that it would take approximately five years to resolve her \noutstanding debts enrolled in the plan. She testified that she received financial \ncounseling from the debt-consolidation company; she developed a budget and had \nseparate bank accounts from which she paid her bills and set aside her spending \nmoney; she checked her credit reports and was working on increasing her credit score; \nand she intended to live within her means. She earns approximately $40,000 to $50,000 \nannually and estimated a $1,500 monthly net remainder after expenses, which she sets \naside for emergency expenses, savings, or to resolve some of her smaller debts in her \ndebt-consolidation plan. She testified that she had approximately $700 in savings. (Tr. \nat 64-65, 72, 104-105, 108-114, 124-125, 136, 143-146, 148-151; AE D, S, T). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe chief executive officer (CEO) of Applicant\u2019s employer, since its founding in \n2010, testified. He has worked in the classified arena for approximately 20 years. He \nhired Applicant as a program manager in April 2017, at an initial annual salary of \n$40,000. In May 2018, she was promoted to supervise a team of two, and her annual \nsalary as of the date of the hearing was $50,000. He interacts with her daily. He testified \nthat he first learned about the extent of Applicant\u2019s financial problems when their facility \nsecurity officer (FSO) notified him of such after she completed her 2017 SCA. He further \nlearned about her indebtedness when he reviewed the SOR after it was issued in \nAugust 2018. He attributed her delinquent finances to her youth and lack of steady \nemployment. He testified that he worked \u201cextensively\u201d with Applicant to ensure that she \nwas resolving her debts, and he had no concerns about her ability or willingness to \ncontinue do so. He testified that she had proven herself \u201cresponsible\u201d over the two-year \nperiod of her employment. He described her as a \u201cmodel employee\u201d with exceptional \nperformance. Character references, to include her FSO and two coworkers, also \nattested to her trustworthiness and reliability. (Tr. at 16-41; AE M, N, O).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s boyfriend testified. As of the date of the hearing, he was an active \nduty member of the U.S. military earning approximately $60,000 annually. He and \nApplicant began dating in around January 2018, and Applicant moved in with him that \nDecember. He has since paid their larger household expenses, and she has paid their \nsmaller ones, so that she can focus on repaying her delinquent debts through her debt-\nconsolidation plan. He was aware of the SOR allegations. He also attributed her \ndelinquent debts to her immaturity and was confident that she learned from her \nmistakes and would responsibly handle her finances going forward. (Tr.at 41-71). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c).  \n\n \n7 \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nher financial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under \nher circumstances. With her limited income, she prioritized her expenses and attempted \nto resolve her delinquent debts before the August 2018 SOR. When her rent was \nincreased in late 2015, she unsuccessfully tried to obtain rental assistance to resolve \nher delinquent rent underlying the SOR \u00b6 1.a judgment. She tried to reach a payment \nplan for the auto loan underlying the SOR \u00b6 1.b judgment, but she could not afford the \n$20,000 payment in full demanded by the creditor. She made payments toward her \ncredit card in SOR \u00b6 1.e, after it became delinquent in June 2015 and through May \n2018, when she mistakenly forgot to provide the creditor with her updated bank account \ninformation after her account was compromised. She made payments toward her \nstudent loan in SOR \u00b6 1.h from June 2015 to March 2018. She returned the cable \nequipment for the debt underlying SOR \u00b6 1.j in November 2017.  \n  \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she \nneed only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant enrolled the remainder of her outstanding debt in a debt-consolidation plan, \nfor which she was paying $238 monthly, in October 2018. She paid $16,000 into that \nplan as of the date of the hearing. She received financial counseling from the debt-\n\n \n8 \n \nconsolidation company. With her monthly net remainder of approximately $1,500 after \nexpenses, she intended to continue to resolve her remaining debts. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his past drug abuse and related criminal activities. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on June 12, 2017. On \nAugust 17, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines H and J. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 17, 2018, and requested a decision \non the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on October 4, 2018. On October 5, 2018, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM,) which included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5, was sent to \n03/22/2019\n\n \n2\nApplicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on October \n12, 2018, and responded on October 23, 2018. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 6, 2018. On February 8, 2019, I reopened the record to allow both parties to \nsubmit any additional evidence. Neither of the parties submitted additional information, \nand I closed the record on February 22, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant purchased and used \nmethamphetamine with varying frequency from April 1995 through at least March 2015, \nand that he manufactured methamphetamine from approximately March 2012 through at \nleast July 2012. The SOR further alleges that in July 2012, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance, he later pled guilty and was \nsentenced to three years\u2019 probation and fined. Applicant violated his probation, and it was \nrevoked.  \n \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in 2002 and \ncharged with receiving stolen property, and was arrested in 2007 and charged with \nreceiving stolen property and flight to avoid in-state detainer. The SOR cross-alleges the \nJuly 2012 arrest, conviction, and sentence. It further alleges that in March 2015, Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with burglary, he pled guilty and was sentenced to 12 months \nimprisonment to be served concurrently with the 22 months of probation that had been \nrevoked from the July 2012 arrest and conviction. Applicant admits each of the \nallegations, offers brief explanations, and states that since he was released from \nincarceration, he has paid his fines and is no longer on probation. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old janitor employed by a defense contractor since April \n2017. Applicant has two minor children. (GX 3.) Applicant first use methamphetamine in \nApril 1995 while at a party with a friend. He states that he became immediately addicted. \nHe began to use methamphetamine, which he purchased on the street, daily. Over time, \nApplicant turned to theft to support his addiction, which resulted in the 2002 and 2007 \narrests. (GX 3; GX 4; GX 5.) \n \nIn 2012, Applicant\u2019s addiction escalated and he began to manufacture \nmethamphetamine at home. His mother reported his activity to the police and Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with manufacturing a controlled substance. He served 17 days \nin jail, and was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation. Despite being on probation, Applicant \ncontinued to use methamphetamine. In March 2015, he broke into a residence \npresumably to steal items, but did not take anything. Applicant was alarmed by his \nbehavior and, recognizing that he needed help with his addiction, sought out local law \nenforcement and turned himself in for arrest. (GX 3.) He was arrested and charged with \nburglary and his probation was revoked. Applicant pled guilty and was incarcerated from \nMarch 2015 until January 2017. (GX 3; GX 4.) \n \n\n \n3\nApplicant successfully completed a drug treatment program and was accepted for \nwork release in approximately September 2016. He was released from prison and \nsuccessfully completed his probation in January 2017. He has been working for his \ncurrent employer since April 2017, where he has been a crew leader for more than one \nyear. He has fully paid his fines. (Response; Answer.) Applicant\u2019s employer is an \nemployment rehabilitation and placement program familiar with Applicant\u2019s background. \nAs a condition of employment, Applicant was required to undergo a background \ninvestigation and submit to a drug screening.  \n \nApplicant fully disclosed his prior drug use and related arrests on his e-QIP and \nopenly discussed them during his personal subject interview. He is remorseful for the \nharm he caused his family and himself, including the financial strain he placed on his \nfamily because he was unable to maintain steady employment during his addiction. \nApplicant has not used methamphetamine or any other illegal substance since March \n2015. He has no intention of using drugs or participating in criminal conduct in the future. \nHis professional and personal lives are stable and he is supporting himself financially. He \nstated that \u201ceveryone\u201d is aware of his past drug addiction and related criminal conduct. \n(GX 4.) Applicant stated his intention to never used drugs in the future on his signed, \nsworn e-QIP.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n4\nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by the record evidence, establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution . . . . \n \n \n\n \n5\nThe following mitigating conditions may also apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nApplicant was addicted to methamphetamine for many years, during which time \nhe committed criminal acts to support his addiction. However, when Applicant broke in to \na residence in March 2015, he recognized that his addiction was out of control and that \nhe needed help. Aware that he had committed a crime and was in violation of probation \nand would likely go to prison, he nevertheless voluntarily surrendered to law enforcement, \nwhich constitutes a profound acknowledgment of his drug involvement. He pled guilty, \nwhich necessarily required that he admit his conduct. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s past drug \nuse is well known by his family, friends, and colleagues. He has not used any illegal \nsubstances since March 2015. He successfully completed a drug program, was \nforthcoming during his background investigation, and passed a drug screening. He has \nalso submitted a signed statement of his intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance abuse in the future. Given Applicant\u2019s four years of abstinence and the record \nevidence as a whole, I conclude that AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d): violation or revocation of parole or probation. . . . \n \n \n\n \n6\nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \nWhile addicted to methamphetamine, Applicant committed crimes to support his \naddiction. He was arrested four times between 2002 and 2015, for receiving stolen \nproperty, fleeing to avoid detention, manufacturing methamphetamine, and finally for \nburglary. In 2012, he was placed on probation for three years, yet continued to use \nmethamphetamine. In 2015, he broke in to a residence. However, he did not steal \nanything from the residence and voluntarily surrendered for arrest, pled guilty, and was \nsentenced to prison. He was granted work release in 2016 and released from prison and \nsuccessfully completed probation in 2017. He has worked for his current employer since \nApril 2017 and was promoted to crew leader over one year ago. He fully paid his fines. \nThere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including no criminal conduct in four years, \nsuccessful completion of probation, and a good employment record. AG \u00b6 32(d) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and J in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant has met his high burden of persuasion.  His four years of abstinence \nclearly demonstrates his commitment to reform and rehabilitation. He accepts \nresponsibility and is remorseful for his past conduct. Applicant candidly disclosed his past \ndrug abuse and related criminal history. His voluntary surrender to law enforcement and \nhis disclosures of adverse information are indicators of his willingness to self-report any \nunforeseen misconduct. His positive behavioral changes are a testament to his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment.  \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and  \nJ and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has \n\n \n7\ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.e:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",
